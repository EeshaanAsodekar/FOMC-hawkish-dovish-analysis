# FOMC Hawkish-Dovish Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project evaluates the hawkish and dovish sentiment across FOMC meeting minutes, Fed speeches, and Fed Chair press conferences. Using NLP techniques such as dictionary-based TFIDF hawkish/dovish scoring and cosine similarity, the sentiment is quantified, and its relationship with key financial indicators like bond yields, yield spreads, and equity markets is explored.

## Data and Hawkish/Dovish Scoring Approach Implemented
### Data Sources: 
- [FOMC meeting minutes](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/tree/main/data/raw/FOMC/meeting_minutes)
- [FOMC statements](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/tree/main/data/raw/FOMC/statements)
- [Fed Governor speeches](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/tree/main/data/raw/fed_speeches)
- [Fed Chair Press conferences](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/tree/main/data/raw/fomc_press_conf/texts)

We analyze all these Fed transcripts from 2012 to 2024, the reason being the distinct shift in the manner of communication by the Fed post-2012; the communication became more direct and transparent.

### Hawkish/Dovish Scoring: 
1. Dictionary-Based Approach
    - Custom dictionaries [link](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/data/processed/hawkish_gpt_dict.txt) were created with hawkish and dovish terms to score sentiment within Fed communications. The composite score measures the relative balance of hawkish vs. dovish sentiment using:
    **Composite Score = (h_score - d_score) / (h_score + d_score)**
    - This approach applies a **TF-IDF-based** analysis to assess how sentiment shifts align with movements in key market variables.
2. Cosine similarity-based sentiment analysis.
    - This method uses **FinBERT embeddings** to compute **cosine similarity** between new text data and pre-defined [hawkish/dovish phrases](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/factor_similarity.py), adding a semantic dimension to sentiment tracking.

## Analysis on Hawkish/Dovish Score changes and Market moves:
Quintile-based visualizations and Regression Analysis show how shifts in hawkish sentiment (via hawkish/dovish scores by both methods) influence moves of these [market indicators](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/data/raw/FOMC_Data_2011_2024.xlsx):
- Treasury yields (2Y, 10Y)
- Yield curve spreads (2s10s)
- Gold
- VIX
- S&P 500 Index

## Running Instructions:
1. **Getting FOMC meeting minutes and statements:** Run the [FOMC_minutes_statements_scraper.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/FOMC_minutes_statements_scraper.py) and [FOMC_minutes_statements_processing.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/FOMC_minutes_statements_processing.py) to get a processed version of the FOMC Meeting Minutes and Statements, which is stored in the [data/processed/](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/tree/main/data/processed) folder.

2. **Getting Fed Chair Press Conference Transcripts:** Run the [press_conference_scraper.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/press_conference_scraper.py) to get all the Fed Chair FOMC press conference transcripts.

3. **Getting Fed Governor's Speeches' Transcripts:** Run the [fed_speeches_scraper.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/fed_speeches_scraper.py) to get all the Fed Governor speeches' transcripts.

4. **Getting the Dictionary based Hawkish/Dovish Scores:** Run the [dictionary_based_analysis.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/dictionary_based_analysis.py) to get the dictionary-based hawkish/dovish scores for all the Fed communications we extracted.

5. **Getting the Cosine Similarity based Hawkish/Dovish Scores:** Run the [factor_similarity.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/factor_similarity.py) to get the factor similarity approach-based hawkish/dovish scores for all the Fed communications.

6. **Visualizing the Fed Hawkish/Dovish Sentiment vs Market moves:** Run the [results.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/results.py) to get the quintile plots of the Fed Hawkish/Dovish sentiment vs the market moves. Quintile plots are chosen so that we can analyze the overall trend in the hawkish/dovish scores and the market variables, to decide if the market moves make intuitive sense to facilitate further analysis or tweaking the models/dictionaries.

7. **Performing Statistical Analysis on the hawkish/dovish sentiment and the market moves:** Run the [regression_analysis.py](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/src/regression_analysis.py) to get R-squared and other parameters to gauge the significance of the hawkish/dovish score and the market moves.

## Key Results Obtained
### Dictionary Based Approach
1. **Moves in the VIX against change in the hawkish-score-1**
![Hawkish-score-1 v/s VIX Moves](https://github.com/EeshaanAsodekar/FOMC-hawkish-dovish-analysis/blob/main/data/results-vizl/Hawkishness-score-1/dict-hawkish-scored_Fed-chair-press-conf%20based%20Median%205-Day%20Cumulative%20VIX_pct_change%20Across%20Hawkishness-score-1%20Quintiles.png)
Intuitive underlying relationship: As the Fedâ€™s hawkishness increases, there is an increase in volatility. The intuitive logic being that tightening monetary policy leads to a decrease in asset prices. This makes sense because a big move in hawkishness translates to a big potential Fed rate hike, which then has its effects on the market valuations, which in turn leads to a correction, thereby increasing the VIX.
