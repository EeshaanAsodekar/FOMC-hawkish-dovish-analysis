Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference 
January 25, 2012 
 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Good afternoon and welcome .   
In my opening remarks I will briefly review today ’s policy decision by the Federal Open 
Market Committee .  And then I ’ll discuss next the consensus statement that has been distributed 
to you regarding the  Committee ’s longer -run policy goals and strategy .  And finally, I ’ll place 
today ’s policy decision in the context of our economic projections and our assessments of the 
appropriate path  of monetary policy .  And I’ll then , of course , be glad to take your questions .   
As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, to support a stronger 
economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time , is at levels consistent w ith our 
statutory mandate, the Committee  expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for 
monetary policy .  In particular, the Committee  decided to keep the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least until late 2014 .  To provide 
support for the recovery in the c ontext of price stability, the Committee  will also continue the 
program that we  announced in September to extend  the average maturity of the Federal 
Reserve’s  holdings of securities .   
Following careful deliberations, Committee  participants have reached broad  agreement 
on a statemen t that sets forth our longer -run goals and policy strategy .  This statement should not 
be interpreted as indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy .  
Rather, its purpose is to increase the transparency and predictability of policy .  There is today 
widespread agreement that clear and transparent central bank communications fa cilitate 
well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduce economic and financial 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
2 of 29 uncertainty, increase the effectiveness of  monetary policy , and enhance accountability to the 
public .   
The statement begin s by noting the Committee ’s firm commitment to fulfill our statutory 
mandate of promoting maximum employment, stable prices , and moderate long -term interest 
rates .  Since monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag, 
our decisions appropriately reflect the Committee ’s longer -run goals, our medium -term outlook, 
and our assessment of the balance of  risks , including risks to the financial system that could 
impede the attainment of o ur goals .   
An important aspect of policy transparency is clarity about policy objectives .  With 
respect to the objective of price stability, it is essential to recognize that the  inflation rate over the 
longer  run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee  has the ability  
to specify a longer -run goal for inflation.  The Committee  judges that infl ation at the rate of 
2 percent , as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures, is most consistent over the longer  run with our statutory  mandate.  Over time, a 
higher inflation rate would reduce the public ’s ability to make accurate longer -term economic 
and financial decisions, whereas a  lower inflation rate would be associated with an elevated 
probability of falling into deflation , which can lead to significant economic problems .  Clearly 
communicating to the public this 2 percent goal for inflation over the longer  run should help 
foster price stability and moderate long -term interest rates  and will enhance the Committee ’s 
ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances .   
Maximum employment stands on an equal footing with price stability as an objective of 
monetary policy .  A difference with price stability is that the maximum level of employme nt in a 
given economy is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
3 of 29 dynamics of the labor market , including demographic trends, the pace of technological 
innovation, and a variety of other influences , including a range of econo mic policies .  Because 
monetary policy does not determine the maximum level of employment that the economy can 
sustain in the longer term, and since many of the determinants of maximum employment may change over time or may not be directly measurable, it i s not feasible for any central bank to 
specify a fixed goal for the longer -run level of employment .   
Although the Committee  cannot freely choose a longer -run goal for employment, it can 
estimate the level of maximum employment and use that estimate to inf orm its  policy decisions .  
The Committee  considers a wide range of indicators in  making its  assessments of maximum 
employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision over time .  For example, in the latest set of  projections that have been distributed to you, 
Committee  partic ipants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have a central 
tendency of 5.2 per cent to 6.0 percent —roughly unchanged from last January but higher than the 
corresponding inte rval several years ago .  As I noted, the level of maximum employment is not 
immutable ; in particular, it could be increased by effective polic ies, such as education  and 
training that improve work force skills .  If the Committee ’s assessments pointed to an increase in 
the maximum attainable level of employment, our policy strategy would be modified appropriately to aim at the higher level .   
In setting monetary policy, the Committee  seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 
its mandate- consistent rate and deviations of employment from our assessments of its maximum 
level .  These dual objectives are generally complementary .  For example, under present 
circumstances, in which the unemployment rate is elevated and the inflation outlook is subdued, the Committee  judges that sustaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
4 of 29 consistent with promoting bot h objectives .  And in the longer  term, low and stable inflation can 
help promote healthy growth in output and employment .   
Of course, circumstances may sometimes arise in which the dual objectives are not 
complementary .  In such cases, the Committee  follows a balanced approach in promoting these 
two objectives, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and potentially different time 
horizons over which inflation and employment are projected to return to levels judged consistent with our mandate .  In other words , the Committee always treat s its primary objectives of pric e 
stability and maximum employment symmetrically, and the stance of policy at any given time is determined by the size, social cost, and expected evolution of the deviations of each of the Committee ’s policy objectives from its desired level.   
I will now turn t o the economic projections of the 17 FOMC parti cipants —that is , 
5 Board members and 12  Reserve Bank presidents —submitted in conjunction with today ’s 
meeting .  The central tendencies and ranges of those projections for the years 20 11 to 2014 and 
over the longer  run are depicted in the figures that ha ve been distributed.  The longer -run 
projections —shown at the right of each figure —represent participants ’ assessments of the rate to 
which each variable will converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy .   
Incoming in formation suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately , 
notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.  The Committee  expects the pace of economic 
growth to be , over  coming quarters —to be moderate over  coming quarters, reflecting ongoing 
drags f rom the housing sector and still -tight credit conditions for many households and smaller 
businesses .  Specifically, participants ’ projections for the growth rate of real gross domestic 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
5 of 29 product in 2012 have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent .  Strains  in global financial markets 
continue to pose significant downside risks to that outlook.   
Looking further ahead, economic activity is expected to acceler ate gradually in 
conjunction with strengthening consumer and business confidence, improving financial  
conditions , and the  continuation of  a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy .  
Specifically, participants ’ GDP projections  for 2013 have a central tendency of 2.8 to 
3.2 percent, and their projections for 2014 have a central tendency of 3.3 to 4.0 percent, 
noticeably higher than the central tendency of 2.3 to 2.6 percent  for their longer- run growth 
projections .   
A number of recent indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market 
conditions, but the unemployment rate remains el evated .  Moreover, in light of the anticipated 
modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee  expects that over coming quarters the 
unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate- consistent levels .  Indeed, 
participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a 
central tendency o f 8.2 to 8.5 percent  that is  little different from the latest monthly reading of 
8.5 percent .  With economic growth expected to pick up somewhat over time, the unemployment 
rate is expected to decline to 6.7 to 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above 
partic ipants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment .   
I’ll turn now to the outlook for inflation.  The prices of oil and other commodities ha ve 
generally flattened out or turn ed downward over the past couple of quarters, while low levels of 
resource utilization have continued to constrain the growth of labor cost s.  Consequently, 
consumer price inflation —which surged in the first half of last y ear—has been subdued in recent 
months .  Survey measures and financial market indicator s imply that longer -term inflation 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
6 of 29 expectations have remained stable.  Over coming quarters, the Committee  anticipates that 
inflation will run at or below levels consiste nt with the mandate- consistent rate of 2 per cent.  
Specifically, participant s’ inflation projections have a central tendency of 1.4 to 1.8 percent for 
2012 and remain subdued at around 1½ to 2 percent through 2014.   
As a further step in enhancing the clarity of our communications, the Committee  recently 
decided to begin publishing information about participants ’ assessments of appropriate monetary 
policy —that is , the path of policy th at each participant judges as most  likely to foster 
mandate- consistent outcomes for employment and inflation if the economy evolves as expected.  
These judgments about  future policy underlie the participants ’ projections of growth, 
unemployment , and inflation that I just described.  Rather —excuse me— Importantly, these 
policy assessments should not be viewed as unconditional pledges .  Rather , just as with our 
economic projections, these policy projections reflect the information available at the time of the 
forecast and are subject to future  revision in light of evolving economic and financial conditions .   
In the chart labeled “A ppropriate T iming of P olicy F irming, ” each shaded bar indicates 
the number of Committee  participants who judge that the initial increase in the target federal 
funds rate would appropriately occur in the specified calendar year shown below the bar .  Six 
participants anticipate that policy firming is likely to commence in 2015 or 2016, while five  
others expect policy firming to commence in 2014 .  The remai ning six  parti cipants judge that 
policy liftoff would be appropriate in 2012 or 2013 .   
More detail  is provided by the  chart labeled “A ppropriate P ace of P olicy Firming. ”  In 
that chart, the dots depict the distribution of participants ’ assessments regarding the appropriate 
level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next several years and over the longer  run.  For example, based on current information, 11 participants expect that the 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
7 of 29 appropriate federal funds rate a t the end of 2014 will be at or below 1 percent , while 
6 participants anticipate higher rates at that time .  In effect, those judgments are reflected in 
today ’s meeting statement , in which the Committee  indicated that economic conditions “ are 
likely to war rant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. ”   
As I have noted, we are also proceeding with the program that we announced in 
September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve ’s holding of securities, t hereby 
fostering more  accommodative financial conditions without changing the overall size of the 
Federal Reserve’ s balance sheet .  The Committee  regularly reviews the size and composition of 
our securities holdings , and we will adjust those holdings as appropriate .  In particular, the 
Committee  recognizes the  hardships imposed by high and persistent unemployment and  an 
underperforming economy , and it is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if 
employment is not making sufficient progress towar d our assessment s of its maximum level or if 
inflation show s signs of  moving further below its mandate -consistent rate .  Thank you for your 
patience.  I’ll be happy to take your questions .   
STEVE LIESMAN .  Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Mr . Chairman, we’ve had  
several months of economic data that ’s been stronger than most forecasters expected —
employment was over 200,000, the unemployment rate ’s come down to 8½ percent —but there 
seems to be very li ttle mention  of this recent strength in the statement.  Do you and the 
Committee , Mr. Chairman, harbor doubts about the recent strength in the economy?  And are 
you and the Committee  baking i n additional quantitative easing in order to achieve the growth 
rates that you ’ve even forecast here?  Thank you.   
CHAIR MAN BERNANKE .  Steve, there ’s certainly been some encouraging news 
recently .  We ’ve seen slightly better performance in the labor market , consumer sentiment has 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
8 of 29 improved, i ndustrial production has been relatively strong —so there are some positive signs, no 
doubt .  At the same time, we ’ve had mixed results in some other areas, such as retail sales , and 
we continue to see head winds emanating from Europe , coming from the slowing global economy 
and some other factors as well .  So, you know, we are obviously hoping that the strength we saw 
in the fourth quarter and in recent data will continue into 2012, but we ’re going to continue to 
monitor that situation .  I don’ t think we ’re ready to declare that we ’ve entered a new , stronger 
phase at this point ; we’ll contin ue to look at the data .  We will, as I ’ve said in my statement, and 
as we have in fact in the FOMC statement, you know, we continue to review our holdings —our 
portfolio holdings, securities , and we are prepared to take further steps in that directi on if we  see 
that the recovery’s  faltering or if inflation is not moving toward target.  So that ’s something —
that’s  an option that ’s certainly on the table.  I think it would be premature to say definitively one 
way or the other, but we continue to look at that option , and if conditions warrant, we will 
certainly consider using it .   
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Thank you.  I’m a little confused by these  forecast s.  I was 
hoping you could sort of help me understand what we ’re looking at .  It seems to say that you 
expect that at the end of 2014, unemployment will be at or above 7 percent , inflation will be at or 
below 2 percent —and yet 11 of the 17 members of your Committee  think that will be a good 
moment to start raising interest rates again .  If unemployment and inflati on are in fact symmetric 
objectives for the Fed, how can that possibly be the case?  And is there any tolerance for 
above -trend inflation in the service of catch -up growth?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, let me first observe that we have in fact , of course , 
been very accommodative in the last couple of years .  We ’ve ke pt interest rates close to zero , 
we’ve done two rounds of asset purchases , we have announced—today , in fact —an extension of 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
9 of 29 the period over which we expect to see rates very low , and our maturity extension program is 
still ongoing, so we maintain a quite accommodative path of policy at this point .  I would further 
say that I think it’ s important to emphasize that we ’re not going to mechanically take the interest 
rate projections that participants p rovide and just build policy off of that .  I mean , it’s still going 
to be necessary for the Committee  to exercise collective judgment , to consider the cost s and risks  
of additional policy actions, to discuss the uncertainty about the forecast and other factors that 
come into the policy decision.  Now, all that being said, if inflation is going to remain below target for an extended period, and unemployment progress is very slow, then I think your implicit question is right, t here is a case for additional policy action , and we ’ll—you know, we 
want to continue to observe the situation, but we ’re certainly prepared to look for different ways 
to provide support to the economy if , in fact , we have this unsatisfactory situation .   
CRAIG TORRES .  Hi, Mr . Chairman, Craig Torres from Bloomberg News .  Congrats on 
the inflation target, or goal —that’s a big achievement for you, I ’m sure .  I’d like to ask if you 
could explain a little bit the way you think inflation is now working in the economy .  The 2012 
central tendency is kind of low , and along with that question, I ’d like to know where you think 
full employment is in the near  term , like the next year or t wo, given the structural impediments 
that many Fed officials have been talking about .   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, there are a number of factors that make us expect 
inflation to be quite low in the next couple of years .  Certainly, we are seeing a reversal , or at 
least a  flattening out, of the commodity price increases that caused headline inflation to rise 
earlier in 2011.  And the futures markets , and  our own estimates of supply and demand globally 
with the slowing global economy , suggest that most likely —although, of course , there ’s a lot of 
uncertainty —that commodity prices will remain well controlled over the next couple of years .  
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
10 of 29 On top of that , of course , we have a very high rate of unemployment ; pressure on wages is quite 
restrained .  And putting that t ogether with strong productivity gains, the cost s of production—
unit labor costs —are growing very slowly .  Expectations of inflation seem well anchored  and, in 
fact, have been on the low side relative to recent history in recent months .  So for all those 
reasons, inflation looks to be at or modestly below th e 2 percent target going forward.  With 
respect to the maximum employment measure, we provided a —we h ave been providing , in fact , 
for four years , as long as we’ve been provi ding the economic projections —an estimate of the 
long-run sustainable rate of unemployment , which is currently —the central tendency is currently 
5.2 to 6 percent .  That is higher than it was a couple of years ago, reflecting structural 
impediments and other changes .  We ’re concerned that the large amount of long -term 
unemployment may be causing some workers to lose skills or lose labor force attachment, which, 
at least for a while , will also likely increase the so -called natural rate, or sustainable rate, of 
unemployment .  So there are a number of factors working in that direction.  But in any case, 
while there ’s certainly a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the natural  rate of unemploy ment 
is, clearly , at 8½ percent, I think we ’re comfortably above anybody ’s estimate , and for that 
reason, we still consider the labor market to be obviously quite slack.   
JON HILSENRATH.  Thank you.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr . 
Chairman, how much confidence do you have in the FOMC ’s ability to forecast the economy 
and inflation out three  years?  And consequently, how much confidence do you have in the 
interest rate projections that the Fed has made public today, particularly the ones that go out to 2014 and beyond?   And if I may add a follow -up to that, there seems to be an asymm etry in these 
dots in that there ’s a view that the  view that matters the most to the Fed is the view of the 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
11 of 29 Chairman .  So when we look at these projections, are we really seeing the most likely expected 
path of interest rates because the C hairman ’s view is n’t represented exclusively here?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, your first que stion —our ability to forecast three and 
four years out is obviously very limited , there’ s no question about that .  Nevertheless, we have to 
make a best guess, a provisional plan, in the same way that  a firm making  an investment has to 
make a best guess or provisional plan about where the economy and the industry is going to be 
over a number of years .  And s o it’s certainly possible that we will be either too optimistic or too 
pessimi stic, in which case we’ ll have to adjust both our forecasts and our policy expectations .  
That being said, you know, currently, the zero  lower bound on policy rates —at least according to 
many estimates —is still binding ; that is, even if the economy were a bit stronger, the very low 
interest rates we currently have would still be valid, still be appropriate .  And so for that reason, 
unless there ’s a substantial stren gthening of the economy in the near  term, I would think that it ’s 
a pretty good guess that we  will be keeping rates low for some time from now .  We don’ t 
identify the specific individuals who provide the projections .  Among other reasons, we want to 
make sure that people come to the meeting willing to talk and not be wedded to a specific 
position, and that ’s why , again , the Committee  makes a collective decision after using as input 
these projections , which are circulated to all the members of the Committee  before the meeting 
so that they can see what their colleagues believe.  As far as what indivi dual members do 
believe, we certainly have other vehicles for expressing our views .  All of us give speeches, all of 
us give interviews and are —you know, I give frequent testimony, so there  are plenty of 
opportunities to get a sense of what individual members believe.  But again, we felt that this 
information , which presents both the diversity of views in the Committee  but also shows where 
the central tendencies lie,  would be useful .  And I guess I might add to that, you know, the 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
12 of 29 Chairman ’s term is not inf inite and a t some point there ’ll be a new C hairman, but there ’s a lot 
more continuity on the FOMC collectively .  The average Bank president is on the FOMC for a s 
much as 10 years and G overnors ’ terms  are 14 years .  So even as the C hairman changes, much of 
the FOMC remains continuous .  So, as we talk about interest rates in 2014, the fact that there is 
quite wide -ranging agreement that interest rates will be low for a long time, should give you 
more confidence that that ’s not dependent on a single individual .   
GREG IP .  Greg Ip  of the Economist .  Mr . Chairman, the Fed ’s statutory goals are price 
stability and maximum employment, but traditionally the Fed has interpreted that somewhat 
flexib ly in the sense that if there was  a conflict between the two, they would push for price 
stability rather than for full employment on the view that over  time, stable prices was the best 
contribution monetary policy could make to maximum  employment .  But today you went to 
some pains  to say that , actually, you treat these goals —put them on a n equal footing , and that 
there might be circumstances in which you put one above the other .  So following up a little bit 
on Binyamin ’s question, do I take it that if inflation wer e to move somewhat above  your 
2 percent preferred level , that you would tolerate that in order to make further progress on 
unemployment?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , the period of time, yes , we treat them symmetrically .  
We cannot cont rol, of course , where inflation  and unemployment are at each moment in time , 
and so there will be periods when, for reasons outside of our control, inflation and unemployment will move away from their desired levels .  If—In those situations, the speed at 
which —I think “ tolerate”  might be too s trong of a word , because we always want to get 
everything , both sides of the mandate, back to their desired levels —but the speed at which we 
would enforce that return would depend on what ’s happening with the other variable .  So, for 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
13 of 29 example, if inflation did go above target by a modest amount, we would certainly try to get it 
back down to target , but if unemployment were very high, that would lead us to be more cautious 
and slower in returning to target .  So that ’s why “ medium  term ”—which is , these targets  are all 
medium  term —is a flexible concept , and it depends on the initial conditions, how far away the 
two key variables are from their objectives at the beginning of the process .   
GREG ROBB .  Greg Robb, MarketWatch .  Mr . Chairman, thank you.  You haven’ t had a 
very good time in all the Republican presidential debates , and I was wondering if I could have 
your comment on what you’ ve heard .  And some of the analysts I talked to said that one of the 
reasons for this hostility, perhaps , is that a lot of the Re publican primary voters are on fixed 
incomes and have an inability to invest and make money with their funds .  So could you talk to 
them as well?  And one more thing, if Republicans take back the White House in November and 
ask you to resign, would you?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So I ’m not going to get involved in political rhet oric.  I’m 
just going to stay  completely  away from that .  I have a job to do, a nd as long as I ’m here, I will 
do everything I can to help the Federal Reserve achieve its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  T hat’s my answer to the last part as well .  I’m not going to be thinking 
about hypothetical situations in the future .  In the case of savers, you know, we think about all 
these issues , and we certainly recognize that  the low interest rates that we ’re using to try to 
stimulate investment and expansion of the economy also impose a cost on savers who have a lower return .  And we do hear about that , obviously , and we do think about that .  I guess the 
response I would make  is that the savers in our economy are dependent on a healthy economy in 
order to get adequate returns .  In particular, people ow n stocks and corporate bonds and ot her 
securities as well as , say, T reasury securities , and if our economy is in really bad shape, then 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
14 of 29 they are not going to get good returns on those investments .  So I think what we need to do, as is 
often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are 
needed to help re store the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase 
growth and that , in turn, will lead  ultimately to higher return s across all assets for savers and 
investors .  So that ’s—I think that ’s how we would explain it .  But again, you know, w e 
recognize that during periods like this, savers are getting a lower return .  One reason why it ’s 
extremely important for us to maintain price stability, of course, is that at least that minimizes any loss es due to inflation that savers might suffer .   
DONNA BORAK.  Hi , Chairman .  Donna Borak of American Banker .  Shifting a little 
bit, I ’d like to take a look back to the rules that the Fed released back in late Decem ber.  
Obviously, it was a mammoth task for F ed staff to put fort h, and considered the heart  of  
Dodd–Frank .  There were certain provisions that were left out , including the liquidity 
requirements , due  largely to the fact that there’ s global consensus needed on those rules in the 
Basel III  process .  But I was hoping you could expand a little bit more on the decision for Fed 
staff to forgo specifying what the additional capital requirements would be for those banks that 
were n ot necessarily dee med GSIB s, at least now , but were still above the $50 billio n threshold, 
and to talk a little bit about what the core issues are in deciding whether or not that additional 
capital  should come in the form of a surcharge , what that surcharge might look like , and when 
we might know .  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, you’ re referring , I think, to the 165–166 rules , which 
will focus on the supervisory over sight of the largest banks .  It’s a very big and complicated rule , 
as everyone knows , and so our position at this time is that we would still like to get feedback 
from the industry and from the public about what the best approach is .  So we put out a lot of 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
15 of 29 questions , and we ’ll be considering those dur ing the comment period and after , as we put 
together a  rule.  The notion of the surcharges is that banks which do not pose  significant threats 
to the systemic stability of Unites States, you know, should not have a significant surcharge .  
We’re required to consider these issues by Dodd– Frank, but our view is that i t’s the largest 
banks, the ones whose failure would endanger our financial system , that should be subject to 
these surcharges  because , first —because we need to have them be safer than smaller banks , and 
secondly, because we want to try to equalize the cost of credit tha t they face .  In other words, a 
bank which is thought to be too big to fail gets an artificial subsidy in the interest rate that it can 
borrow at , and by having additional c apital  requirements , that tends to equalize the cost of 
funding to different banks and reduces the incentive of banks to get large just to cr eate the 
impression of being too big to fail .  So we think those are important and we will continue to 
work with them .  The B asel Committee  has provided some sense of the range of what those 
surcharges will fall into , and so we ’re still working o n defining exactly the criteria , but you can 
assume th at it will be a fairly continuous  range between the $50 billion banks and the very 
largest banks in our economy .  As I said , we’re getting reactions and comments .  We hope to 
get—you know, early this year—we hope to come back with a clarification on the rule , and of 
course, we ’re also working hard on implementing Basel  III itself , which we want to do during 
2012—we want to put out  the rule during 2012.   
MARK FELSENTHAL .  Mark Felsenthal  with Reuters .  Mr . Chairman , for more than 
three years now, the Fed has conducted policy through extraordinary means , and yet the new 
information that we have today pertains mostly to an eventual tightening of policy through raising interest rates .  Why is there no new information about the size of the Fed ’s balance sheet , 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
16 of 29 and what should anybody looking at your communications  today deduce about an eventual 
expansion of  the balance sheet through more asset purchases?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So we will be providing , in our minutes and in our S urvey 
of Economic P rojections , which will be released in three weeks —we ’ll be providing some 
additional qualitative information about peoples ’—participants ’ views of the balance sheet going 
forward .  The reason that I can ’t provide all that information now is basically that we received, 
you know, a whole range of qualitative comments , and we had further discussion during the 
meeting yesterday and today , and so, you know, we ’re going to need a little time to summarize 
that and to have it approved by, you know —the minutes , of course , and the  SEP are approved by 
the entire Committee —and so, in that respect , it will be a definitive statement about what we 
currently know about the balance sheet .  I can say a few things .  You know , one is that it 
certainly remains —ex panding the balance sheet  certainly remains an option , one that we would 
consider very seriously if —in particular , if progress toward full employment was continued, or it 
became more, inadequate , or if inflation remained  exceptionally low .  So we ’ll continue to look 
at that .  As we say in our statement, we ’re prepared to take additional measures in general, and 
that would be certainly one class of measures  we would want to consider .  I can make one 
additional point , which  maybe wasn ’t obvious, which is that , in June , we provided some 
principles relating the sales of assets —ultimate sales of assets —to the path of interest rates, and 
those remain —those principles remain in force .  And so one implication of our extension of our 
expected point of take off to late 2014 is to imply that the initial sales from our balance sheet, 
which again are far down the road but —that begins —that will be later than previously thought .  
That will be presumably in 2015.  So we do expect to hold our balance sheet at a high level for a 
longer period.  Additional sales again —I’m sorry —Additional purchases remains a topic that we 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
17 of 29 are still debating , and it will depend both on our assessment of the efficacy and the risks of that 
particular tool , but als o of how the economy is evolving.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr . Chairman, wh en I 
look at these forecasts for 2014, the media n of the forecast is , I think, 0.75 and the mean is 
1.12 percent .  If I were to draw a line through this —these dots, how should I draw it so I best 
understand what the FOMC is most likely to do?  And the second part —in the minutes, you say 
that the Committee  will consider further options for improvements to the SEP, the economic 
projections .  Could you t ell us a bit more about what further you might do?  Thank you.   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, again, first I want to emphasize that there is no 
mechanical relationship between these projections and the outcomes of the FOMC decisions .  Of 
course, they ’re a big  input into those decisions , but it ’s a collective decision .  If you want to draw 
lines, I guess I would— I guess my suggestion would be to look at the median, the middle of the 
distribution , because we do have a democratic process in the Committee , and so the median 
would give you some se nse of where the weight balances against higher —in favor of higher or 
lower rates .  Again, we did note that in support of our assessment of late 2014, which is a 
Committee  decision , and of course there was a 9- to-1 vote in favor of that, but that is supported 
by the observation that 11 of the 17 participants expect the funds rate at the end of 2014 to be 
1 percent or l ess, and so presumably the take off would not be much earlier than that .  In terms of 
future additions, there are a lot of ways we could go.  W e could provide, for example, more 
relationship s between —more information about the relationship between individuals ’ policy 
preferences and their forecasts , and so on.  But there ’s nothing specific now that  has b een 
decided .  We have a very capable sub committee , which is charged with continual assessment and 
analysis of possible ways of improving our transparency .  So we will be looking at additional 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
18 of 29 possibilities , and we would welcome feedback for that matter .  But there ’s nothing specific 
planned at this point .   
DEREK KRAVITZ .  Derek Kravitz, Associated Press .  Last night the P resident unveiled 
a plan to revamp and expand the government ’s refinancing program .  Essent ially, the Fed 
released a white p aper earlier this month that said that up to 2½ million homeowners could 
benefit from  this, essentially save $3,000 per year in mortgage payments .  Right now there ’s a 
mortgage settlement being broker ed between state attorney s general and the nation’ s majo r 
mortgage lenders, something to the tune of $25 billion, much of which would be in the form of 
principal reduction.  In the white p aper that was released earlier this month, the Fed seemed to 
indicate that principal reduction could be helpful , but it was unclear about whether they  thought 
that this was an acceptable or even feasible option .  They also made clear that a lot of the 
proposals that are currently out there “eat around the edges, ” so to speak, when you ’re dealing 
with a foreclosure crisis , and a  lot of economi sts agree .  Do you think a principal reduction in the 
form of the major mortgage settlement would do a lot to help the housing crisis ?  And if not, is 
there any other alternative proposal that would help?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , the Feder al Reserve obviously has a very strong 
interest in the housing sector .  The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why 
the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary polic y has not been more powerful —because part of our transmission 
mechanism is through lower interest rates , which affects refinancing ; it affects sales and 
purchases as well .  So, in addition to that, as bank supervisors, we have considerable interest in 
servicing, in loan modifications, in delinquencies , and all the aspects of mortgage lending .  So 
we have a considerable interest in this area, and as you say , we did a white paper , which looked 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
19 of 29 at a number of issues , including refinancing and mortgage finance .  I think it ’s important to say 
that our intent in that white paper was to provide the benefit of our analysis to the public and to 
those who will be making policy .  We did not take specific stands on individual issues .  What we 
tried to do was  provide the pros and the cons and provide some context for these debates .  So we 
did discuss refinancing, we did discuss principal forgiveness .  I would say that there ’s a variety 
of views about principal forgiveness within the Federal Reserve System , and there is n o official 
position.  There— It seems very likely that principal forgiveness could be helpful , depending on 
how it ’s structured , in reducing delinquencies .  There are also some potential drawbacks ; one of 
them is the fact that the amount of negative equity in the United States is about $700 billion, which is enormous, and so there is no conceivable program that is going to put ever ybody in the 
country above water .  And so I think the issue then becomes, if we have $20 or $25 billion or 
whatever the number ma y end up being in this settlement, you know, what is the most cost -
effective way to help as many people as possible?  A nd I think that ’s an ongoing debate .  But 
with respect to principal reduction, you know , I’ve spoken about this in the past , and it certainly 
has some advantages ; a lot depends on how it ’s structured, and a lot depends on what the 
alternatives are that you ’re considering .   
PETER BARNES .  Thank you, M r. Chairman .  Peter Barnes of FOX  Business.  One of 
the goals of the Fed and the release of  all these new materials, the forecast , and the policy 
announcement are to help to create expectations and set expectations .  But are you concerned at 
all that this —that the materials and the forecast s and the policy announcement path today  might 
help create negative expectations ?  In other words, the average American ’s takeaway of your 
announcement to keep interest rates low —exceptionally low , through 2014 now , might signal to 
them that maybe the Fed thinks that the economy is in much worse shape than we a ll thought , 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
20 of 29 and that , in turn, could affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, and the ability to create 
a self -sustaining economic recovery at some point .  Is there a risk of this?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, whenever the Fed takes a policy action , there’s 
always some potential for a signal.  I mean, that ’s true not just in these current times , but anytime 
the Fed lowers or increases interest rates, and that ’s something we have to think about .  But I 
think, generally speaking, that those considerations  are outweighed by the need to maintain 
accommodative financial conditions  so that it’ s attractive to firms to invest and hire, attractive 
for those who are eligible to buy homes, and so on, and I think that that ultimately is more 
powerful than the signal  from the change in policy .  In particular , the markets and the news 
media are very good at picking up the underlying economic data and making assessments of the state of the economy and reporting what different people think about the economy, so I wouldn’ t 
overstate the Fed ’s ability to massively change expectations through its statements, for example .  
So, again, I think that while we certainly take that into account, we think it ’s important for us to 
say what we think, and we think it ’s important for us to provide the right amount of stimulus to 
try to help our economy recover from its currently underutilized condition.   
DARREN GERSH.  Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  Let me kind of follow up on 
Peter ’s question.  W hy shouldn’ t somebody looking at  these numbers from the outside say 
“Look, as aggressive as you say you ’ve been, and as aggressive as you have been, it doesn’ t look 
like you’ re meeting any of your goals for the next three years on the economy, so why isn’ t the 
Fed doing more now? ”  
CHAIR MAN BERNANKE .  Well, again, as I said earlier, the Fed has been doing a great 
deal.  Just since August we have put a date on our expected period of low interest rates .  We 
undertook the maturity extension program , which is still continuing .  Today we announced a 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
21 of 29 further extension of the expected pe riod of low rates .  By issuing this  expected policy rate 
information, we hope to convey to the market the extent to which there is support on the 
Committee  for maintaining rates at a low level for a significant time .  So, you know, I don’ t 
accept the premise that we’ ve been passive ; we’ve been actually quite active in our policy , and in 
one respect, the low level of inflation is a validation in the following  sense , that there were some 
who we re very concerned that our balance sheet policies and the like would lead to high 
inflation .  There’ s certainly no sign of that yet , and it hasn ’t shown up either in financial m arkets 
or in outside forecaster s’ expectatio ns.  Now that being said, as I mentioned earlier, if the 
situation continues , with inflation below target and unemployment declining at a rate which is 
very, very slow, then more —our framework, the logic of our framework, says  we should be 
looking for ways  to do more .  It’s not completely straightforward because, of course, we ’re now 
dealing with a variety of nonstandard policy tools —we can ’t just lower the federal funds rate 
25 basis points like in the good old days —but your basic point is right , that, you know, we need 
to adopt policies that will both achieve our inflation objectives and help the economy recover as quickly as  is feasible.  A nd, I would say that your question—actually , an earlier question —
shows a benefit of explaining this framework because  the framework makes very clear that we 
need to be thinking about ways in which we can provide further stimulus if we don’ t get some 
improvement in the pace of recovery and a normalization of inflation .   
PATRICK WELTER .  Mr . Chairman, Patrick Welter  from the Frankfurter Allgemeine 
Zeitung.  I have two short questions .  Your predecessor, Mr . Greenspan, once said about his 
personal inflation—long- term inflation goal that it would be 0 percent  if appropriately measured .  
And I would like you to compare the in flation goal you told us about today with that statement .  
And, the second question is , Comparing  what you did today, are you approaching more some 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
22 of 29 kind of inflation target ers like the c entral b ank of Sweden or Norway , or are you approaching 
more the European Central Bank , for example, which has some kind of inflation goal but is not 
really an inflation target er?   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Excellent questions .  So, a literal reading of price stability 
would say inflation should be at zero.  Now, there are some technical reasons why that may not 
be true .  There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a 
measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices .  But as we ’ve 
talked about frequently, we set inflation —our inflation objective in a way that was consistent 
with both sides of the mandate :  price stability —and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that 
it’s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the pa rt 
of households and businesses —but also in the interest of employment .   
A target for inflation that was zero would have seve ral consequences .  First, we would be 
spending maybe half of our time , or at least a significant amount of our time , in a deflatio nary 
zone .  And we ’ve seen in many instances that deflation can be bad for economic performance 
and bad for employment , and , therefore, setting an inflation target at zero would be not  
consistent with the other part of our mandate .  Incidentally, related t o that, a zero inflation rate 
would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be , and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a  
situation like today where we reall y can ’t cut the short -term interest rate any further .  So I think 
there are good reasons from a dual -mandate perspective to have inflation greater than 2 percent .  
And I would add that , you know, if you look at central banks around the world, whether they are 
nominal inflation targeters or not, that 2 percent is basically the number that most central banks 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
23 of 29 use; the ECB, many other central banks either us e 2 percent or a range around 2  percent .  So this 
is not at all different from what many other central banks do .   
Now, are we inflation targeters ?  If by “ inflation targeter ” you mean a central bank that 
puts top priority on inflation and other goals , like employment, as subsidiary goals , then the 
answer is no .  We are a dual -mandate central bank :  We put equal weight on price stability and 
maximum employment;  those are the goals given to us by the Congress .  And so, in that respect, 
as I mentioned earlier , I think, to Greg, we ’re not absolutists :  If there ’s a need to let inflation 
return a little bit more slowly to target in order to get a better result in employment, then that ’s 
something that we would be willing to do .  Having said all that, I think it’ s worth noting that 
even banks that —central banks that call themselves inflation targeters typically pay at least some 
attention to other parts of the economy :  employment , growth, financial stability , and the like .  
So I don’ t think there ’s really any central bank , or very few , at least , that focus only on inflation.  
But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve 
because we are going to be evenhanded in  treating the price stability and maximum employment 
parts of our mandate on a level footin g.   
ZACHARY GOLDFARB .  Thank you.  Zach Goldfarb from the Washington Post .  Two 
questions .  First, can you clarify whether if actual economic conditions match their projections, 
that’s an acceptable future course, or that would require additional easing?  And secondly, in the 
past, a number of times you said that even when interest r ates are at the zero bound, the Fed  can 
still have a significant impact on influencing economic growth ; do you still believe that the Fed 
has the capacity to deploy tools that would have a significant impact on bringing down unemployment at a faster pace than we see in these projections if it chose to do so?  
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
24 of 29 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  On the first question, I , you know —as was pointed out by 
Steve, for example—we ’ve had some good data recently .  I think there ’s some uncertainty about 
where the economy is going , and we want to continue to observe how the economy is 
developing .   
But I would say that, as I ’ve said on several —in several answers, that if recovery 
continues to be modest and progress on unemployment very slow , and if inflation appears to be 
likely to be below target for a number of years out —so the configuration we ’re talking about in 
the projections —then I think there would be a very strong case , based on our framework, for 
finding a different —additional tools for expansionary policies or to support the economy .  So 
we’ll continue to look at the different options and try to decide what might be most effective .   
We are in a difficult situation in terms of the effectiveness of policy tools .  My own view , 
thinking about the effects, for example, of additional purchases —additional securities purchases, 
I’ve been pretty satisfied in the sense that —in the following sense, that purchases do seem to 
have the desired effects on f inancial conditions :  They tend to ease financial conditions, they tend 
to lower interest rates, they tend to strengthen asset prices .  And those are exactly the kinds of 
things that monetary policy normally does in order to try to provide stableness to the economy .  
What has been a bit more uncertain is the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism .  And we 
have seen some developments in the economy that have probably weakened the effectiveness of 
policy , including , notably , the housing sector , where one would expect —with mortgage rates 
below 4 percent, one would expect to see more ac tivity than we ’ve been seeing .  And the 
problems in housing finance and so on are part of the reason that the  expansionary stimulus is 
not feeding through as much as we would like to the real economy .  I would not say , though, that 
our policies are —that we ’re out of ammunition.  No, I think we still have tools , but we need to 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
25 of 29 further analyze and study those tools and try to make comparisons in terms of effectiveness, 
risks , and the like .  So I think we still have a process to figure out what is the most effective 
approach .  Does that —yeah, okay .   
STEVE BECKNER .  Steve  Beckner, Market News International , Mr. Chairman, with a  
question about the new forward guidance language i n the statement itself .  And Peter anticipated 
one of my questions  about the potential danger of it  sending a negative signal , but let me ask, 
What was the rationale for continuing to have forward guidance phraseology instead of just 
letting these forecast s, these new forecasts of the funds  rates , speak for themselves?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  No,  that’ s a very good question.  I might have commented 
on Zach’ s question that our two main tools at this point —given that short -term interest  rates  are 
close to zero —are asset purchases, but the other is communications .  And to  the extent that we 
can communicate that rates will be lower for longer, that will ease financial conditions and be a way that we can affect the state of the economy .  And that ’s part of the reason —other than just a 
general desire for transparency —that we brought out some of these ideas at this point .  The 
reason that we just don’ t release the economic projections and leave it at that is because, while 
the economic projections of future policy  rates are an important input to our policy discussions 
around the table, the decision ultimately is made by the Federal Open Market Committee , you 
know, which is the voters sitting around the table, and in a  process by which we exchange ideas 
and make arg uments and come to a collective determination .  So, you know, we don’ t set the 
federal funds interest rate by having members send in their vote and not having a meeting ; we 
have a meeting for a reason, which is to talk to each other and try to come to some  kind of 
consensus .  So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
26 of 29 rates , but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the 
projections  should give significant information about wher e the FOMC is likely to go .   
HUGUES HONOR É.  Hugues Honor é with Agence France- Presse.  The FOMC stated 
that global growth has slowed and, of course , that is weighing on financial conditions in the U.S .  
Arguably, one way that the Federal Reserve could help would be by extending a loan to the 
International Monetary Fund.  There have been other central banks that have  been doing that 
when the government was reluctant to do so, and we have all noted that the  Fed was not shy 
when it came to extending loans to international financial institutions, private banks, and so on that are based or that have subsidiaries in the U.S .  Is it something that you could consider if the 
sovereign debt crisis got worse?  
CHAIRM AN BERNANKE .  Well , lending to financial institutions is part of our 
mandated function;  it’s part of our raison d’ être to provide a lender of last resort in the case of a 
panic , as we ’ve done in the recent crisis .  Committing funds to the IMF I don’ t think  is within the 
purview of the Federal Reserve.  That ’s a decision that ’s made in the first instance by the 
Treasury and the A dministration and in the second instance via approval through the Congress .  
So I think the appropriate deciders in that case would be the A dministration and the Congress, 
not the Federal Reserve .   
SCOTT SPOERRY .  Scott Spoerry , sir, from CNN .  My head ’s full of questions, but I ’m 
going to try and limit it to two related questions .  You’re linking your inflation target of 
2 percent to the PCE .  The PCE is something that hundreds of millions of Americans have no 
idea what it is ; they do know what the CPI is .  Can you explain, in layman ’s term s, something 
that regular folks might understand, why they should not worry too much when infl ation by 
the—if the CPI is different than the PCE ?  And the second question is related also to inflation 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
27 of 29 and to the targeting because  the Fed’s always been a little bit vague in terms of what sort of 
inflation it w ould accept , and this is a marked  change .  Because criticism of the Federal 
Reserve—criticism of you , but the institution itself has been so intense this year because it ’s a 
political year —there are people out there who are going to say “T he Federal Reserve has  finally 
just admitted it.  Their pol icy is to destroy 2 percent of the value of my dollars every year.”   How 
are you going to respond to those people ?  And also, could you answer the question about the 
CPI and the PCE ?  Thank you.   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Sure .  Well, we chose the PCE index for  some , I think, very 
valid technical reasons .  It better allows —better accounts for changes in people ’s purchasing 
patterns ; you know, when some  things become more expensive, people will tend to move to 
other types of goods and services .  That ’s not accounted for by the CPI , which has fixed weight s.  
It also —the PCE —I think more relevant to the average person , the PCE includes all health -care 
costs, not just out -of-pocket cost s, and that has two benefits .  One is , it reduces the share of the 
inflation index  which is tied to housing .  And the CPI ha s a very large share devoted to housing , 
and a large share of that part of the index is imputed—t hat is , essentially made- up numbers .  So 
that’s one benefit , to keep the —you know, not  to put too much weight on the imputed housing 
numbers , which is part of the CPI .  The other is that , even if people are not paying for health care 
immediately out -of-pocket, they do pay for it , either through taxes or through reduced wages as , 
you know, i ncreased health -care costs raise insurance premi ums for employers .  So I think this is 
probably a better measure of the inflation that ’s faced by typical consumers than the CPI is .  That 
being said, these various measures —the CPI and others, PCE i ndex and others —move very 
closely together , and you ’re not going to have a situation where the CPI is 10  percent and the 
PCE is 2 percent .  There may be a few tenths difference, but , generally speaking, they move very 
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
28 of 29 closely together .  So, in that respect, I think if people look at the CPI, they should feel pretty 
comfortable that, you know, that ’s going to be very close to where the PCE inflation is . 
On the 2 percent, again, that ’s where the United States has been for many years .  That ’s 
where most c entral banks are around the world.  There’ s a very good reason for it , which is to 
avoid deflation, which is very negative .  I think the argument that, you know, the value of your 
dollar declines at  2 percent a year is just not really a very good one , unless you’ re one  of those 
people who does their lifetime saving in the mattress .  Most people invest in various kinds of 
instruments , receiving a rate of interest .  And now , it’s true , as has been pointed out , that for the 
moment interest rates are pretty low , but they ’re still positive .  But over a longer period of time , 
if you —even if you have money in a CD or some other investment vehicle, the interest rate will 
compensate you for inflation.  I mean , the two will be tied together .  And so the re really 
shouldn’ t be, you know —at levels of inflation this low , interest rate s should pretty much fully 
compensate for the losses to savers .  But I would reiterate that  we are not unaware of the 
problems that low interest rates cause for savers, cause for pension fund contributions , insurance 
companies , and other parts of the economy , and we do try to take that into account as we think 
about other ramifications of our policy .   
PETER COOK .  Thank you, M r. Chairman .  Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  Two 
questions , if I could, separate from your role here as Fed Chairman .  Two issues in Congress 
right now , on which your advice might be worthwhile .  The payroll tax cut is coming up for 
debate again, this debate about whether to extend it for a full year .  What is your assessment  right 
now of the impact that would have on the U.S . economy if it was not extended?  A nd likewise, 
what if the Congress were to not implement the 1.2 on automatic spending cuts imposed by the 
failure of the super committee —what impact would that have on the U.S . economy?   
January 25, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
   
29 of 29 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as you know, the Federal Reserve makes it a policy to 
try to avoid commenting on specific individual tax and spending programs , and I don’ t have 
those numbers at hand in any case .  But what I would say is the fol lowing —is that what I ’ve 
tried to convey to Congress , and I think many other economists have taken the same view, is that 
responsible fiscal policy has at least two components at this point .  One is , of course , 
importantly , to achieve fiscal sustainability .  And to achieve fiscal sustainability over a long 
period of time , we need to be acting soon —now  would be preferable —to making credible 
commitments to reducing spending, to improving our programs, to modifying or simplifying our 
tax code, and so on, s o as the ways that will be persuasive to the markets or to the public that 
over the longer term, over the next 10, 20, 30 years , that our fiscal position will be sustainable .  
So that ’s an important thing to do.  It relates to the second part of your question.  I think it ’s 
important to take steps at least to —again, the specific steps are up to Congress , but it ’s important 
that action be taken to provide a credible plan to achieve fiscal sustainability .   
The second part of my recommendation, though, is that we need at this juncture to be 
sensitive to the effects of whatever policy decisions are made on what is still a very fragile recovery .  Again, there are many ways to do that , but I think that should be taken in to account as 
people are looking at policy al ternatives in terms of taxes or spending .   
Thank you.

 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference 
April 25, 2012 
 
 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Good afternoon.  Before we get to questions, I ’ll summarize 
today ’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee  and then I ’ll place the Committee ’s 
policy decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment regarding the 
appropriate path of monetary policy .   
As indicated in the statement r eleas ed earlier this afternoon, the Committee  is 
maintaining the highly accommodative policies that we initiated at previous meetings .  We 
decided to keep the target range for the f ederal funds r ate at 0 to ¼ percent , and we continue to 
anticipate that eco nomic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the f ederal 
funds r ate at least through late 2014.  Our program to extend the average maturity of the Federal 
Reserve’ s securit y holdings —announced in September —will continue as scheduled.  Each of 
these policy actions is intended to foster accommodative financial conditions that support the economic recovery in a context of price stability .   
In conjunction with today ’s meeting, FOMC participants —the 5 B oard members and the 
12 R eserve Bank presidents —submitted their individual economic projections and policy 
assessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the long run.  These projections serve as important inputs into the Committee ’s deliberations .   
Incoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately .  Most 
Committee  participants expect economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and 
then to pick up gradually .  Among other factors, and not withstanding some signs of 
improvement, the ongoing weakness of the housing sector still represents a headwind for recovery .  Strains in global financial markets, though less pr onounced, generally , than  last fall, 
continue to pose significant risks  to the outlook.   
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL

 Labor market conditions have improved in recent months , with the unemployment rate 
having fallen nearly a percentage point since August .  However, at 8.2 percent, the 
unemployment rate remains elevated .  Looking ahead, the Committee  anticipates that  the 
unemployment rate will decline gradually over the next several years , reflecting the moderate 
pace of economic growth .  Specifically, participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 7.8 to 8.0 percent , declining to 6.7 to 
7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.  For comparison, participants ’ estimates of the longer -
run normal rate of unemployment have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent .   
Inflation has  picked up somewhat , mainly reflecting higher gasoline prices .  However, as 
has been the case for other recent swings in oil prices, the Committee  expects that effect to be 
only temporary .  Moreover, survey measures and financial market indicators continue to show 
stability in longer -term inflation expectations .  Consequently, we anticipate that inflation will 
subsequently run at or below the Committee ’s longer -run goal of 2 percent .  In particular, 
participants ’ projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2012 and 
1.7 to 2.0 percent for 2014.   
The economic  projection s submitted by FOMC participants are conditioned on their 
individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary policy .  As you can see from the 
chart labeled “ Appropriate Timing of Policy Firming, ” Committee  participants have a range of 
views about when the initial increase in the federal f unds r ate is likely to be appropriate .  
Following a careful discussion of those views at today ’s meeting, the FOMC maintained its 
collective judgment t hat economic conditions will likely warrant exception ally low levels for the 
federal f unds r ate at least through late 2014 .  In particular, a highly accommodative stance of 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
3 of 23 
 monetary policy is warranted in light of the  persistence of the factors restraining the pace of 
recovery and the ongoing risks  to the economic outlook.   
Finally, the Committee  took no new decisions regarding the Federal Reserve ’s balance 
sheet today, but we remain prepared to adjust our securities holdings as appropriate to promote a 
stronger economic recovery in the context of price st ability .   
Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions.  
DARREN GERSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  
Some of your critics —I’m sure you ’re not going to be surprised—think that you’ re still being too 
cautious , that unem ployment is still high, the economy may be slowing, inflation is subdued, and  
I know you just talked about the balance  sheet .  But given that, is the Committee  now any closer 
to QE3 than it was at its last meeting?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , first, the Comm ittee has certainly been bold and 
aggressive in terms of easing monetary policy .  We ’ve maintained the f ederal f unds r ate close to 
zero since late 2008 .  We’ ve had two rounds of so -called quantitative easing .  We ’ve had a 
maturity e xtension program , whic h is ongoing .  We have offered guidance about the f ederal 
funds r ate that goes into at least late 2014 .   
So we ha ve been very accommodative , and we remain prepared to do more as needed to 
make sure that this recovery continues and that inflation stays close  to target.  So , in particular, 
we will continue to assess, you know, looking at the economic outlook, looking at the risks , 
whether or not unemployment is making sufficient progress towards its  longer -run normal level, 
and whether inflation is remaining c lose to target .  And, if appropriate , and depending also on 
assessment of the costs and risks of additional policy actions, we remain entirely prepared to take additional balance sheet  actions if necessary to achieve our obj ectives .  So those tools remain 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
4 of 23 
 very much on the table , and we will not hesitate to use them should the economy require that 
additi onal support. 
JON HILSENRATH.   Mr. Chairman, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street J ournal .  The 
Fed has been forecasting for some time that inflation would fall to 2 percent or below .  The latest 
measures of inflation suggest that the core PC E is at the higher end of that range and many other 
measures are above 2 percent .  I noticed that in your forecast today that the upper end of your 
forecast s all the way through 2014 have increased.  Do you see a risk that the disinflationary 
forces in the economy might not be as strong as the Fed had been projecting for some time?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I would just say , first, that our projections still have 
inflation  very close to our 2 percent target .  As you point out, core inflation and some other 
measures of underlying  inflation ha ve been a little stronger than expected .  But I would say first 
that some of the movement in the first quarter, for example, seems to h ave come from transitory 
sources like nonmarket components .  And the fundamentals of inflation—in particular, inflation 
expectations ; the amount of slack in the economy ; the commodity price behavior , which has 
been relatively well -controlled in recent mont hs—all of those things suggest that inflation is 
going to stay close to or perhaps a bit below our 2 percent target .  Now, as I mentioned in the 
opening remarks and as we said in our briefing, the recent rise in gasoline prices has created a 
temporary bulg e in headline inflation, in overall inflation, but we expect that to pass through the 
system and , assuming no new shocks in the oil sector, inflati on ought to moderate to about 
2 percent later this year.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Why did the lower bound in those forecast s rise?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  The lower bound rose —again, this represents 17 distinct 
views —but I would guess that the reason is that the data have come in a little bit firmer , core 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
5 of 23 
 inflation has been a little stronger than was expected .  But those differences are not particularly 
large.  
PEDRO DA C OSTA .  Mr. Chairman , Pedro da  Costa from Reuters .  So we know that the 
Committee  foresees rates staying very low until late 2014 .  What is your personal view on the 
timing of the first rate hike , on the likely timing ?  And second, do you see the Committee  as 
having an easing bias at the moment or is it neutral ?  Could it go either way?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I ’m very comfortable with the consensus view that 
we enunciated today , and I think that  the Committee  broadly is comfortable —a 9- to-1 vote in 
favor of this guidance .  So again, that represents a very accommodative stance of policy .  Our 
intention is to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for the foreseeable future , and 
we remain  able and willing to take further action if necessary .  At the same time, I think it is 
worth noting that the forward guidance on the f ederal f unds r ate is conditional on the data , and if 
the data were to come in much stronger than expected, we would adjus t the guidance 
appropriately .  So it ’s not unconditional ; it does depend on how the outlook evolves .  And again, 
should the outlook strengthen notably , then we would have to respond to that. 
PEDRO DA COSTA .  How much more weakness would you need to see for  QE3 to be in 
place?  W ould you need to see an actual recession take place?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  The question is, you know, “ How much more weakness do 
we need ?”  The Committee  has to make those assessments , and we ’ve been working to try to 
provide more -explicit guidance, quantitative guidance about our policy reaction function, but so 
far, you know, we haven’ t really done that .  And I can o nly say qualitatively that the Committee  
will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is 
making sufficient progress towards our objectives , and , in particular , whether the recovery is still 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
6 of 23 
 continuing .  And we remain prepared to use balance sheet tools to support the recovery and to 
help make sure that unemployment continues its downward path towards longer -run normal 
levels.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr. Chairman , according to the latest f orecast, 10 members of the 
FOMC see a 1 percent or higher fed funds r ate in 2014;  7 of them see a 2 percent or higher f ed 
funds r ate.  Under that —those conditions, how can the guidance in the statement , that you 
remain exceptionally low through late 2014, be justified ?  And is there a point at which the 
dissonance between the individual forecast s and the guidance get to a point where one or the 
other is no longer te nable ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, there ’s certainly a range of views , as you ’ve noted, 
but these  projections are inputs into a Committee  process .  And it ’s in the Committee  meeting 
that we had yesterday and today where we debate not only the poss ible outcomes, but also the  
risks, the uncertainties, all the things that inform our collectiv e judgment .  And as I said, the 
Committee  had no difficulty coming to a consensus that the guidance that we gave is still 
appropriate .  Again, if there ’s a substa ntial change in the economic outlook in either direction, 
then the guidance would change appropriately .  But for now, I think the Committee  is 
comfortable with the consensus statement that we put out. 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Do you worry about creating confusion i n the market between the 
guidance and the individual forecast s? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , again, the individual  projections are inputs to the 
Committee  decision , so the Committee  decision is the critical element in that respect.  We are 
continuing to work to become more transparent , and we have a variety of things that we ’re 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
7 of 23 
 looking at, so you’ ll have to stay tuned for that .  But again, the Committee  was quite comfortable 
with the consensus that we have reported today.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Unemployment is too high, and you said you expect it to 
remain too high for years to come .  Inflation is under control , and you say that you expect it to 
remain under control .  You sa y that you have additional tools available for you to use, but you’ re 
not using them right  now .  Under these circumstances, it ’s really hard for a lot of people to 
understand why you are not using those tools right now .  Could you address that ?  And 
specifically , could you address whether your current views are inconsistent with the views on 
that subject that you held as an academic?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Yeah .  Let me tackle that second part first .  So there ’s this 
view circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are 
somehow inconsistent with our current policies .  That is absolutely incorrect .  Our —my views 
and our policies today are completely consistent with the views that I held at that time .  I made 
two points at that time to the Bank of Japan .  The first was that I believe that a determined 
central b ank could and should work to eliminate deflation—that is , falling prices .  The second 
point that I made was that when short -term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are 
no longer —are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create 
additional accommodation .  Now, looking at the current situation in United States, we are not in 
deflation .  When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010 , or at least a modest risk in late 
2010, we used additional balanc e sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target .  
Likewise, we have been aggressive and creative in using non- federal -funds -rate-centered tools to 
achieve additional accommodation for the U .S. economy.  So the very critical difference between 
the Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U .S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation , 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
8 of 23 
 and, clearly , when you’ re in deflation and in recession, then both sides of your mandates, so to 
speak, are demanding additional accommodation.  In thi s case , it’s—we are not in deflation, we 
have an inflation rate that ’s close to our objective .  Now, why don’ t we do more ?  Well, first I 
would again reiterate that we are doing a great deal ; policy is extraordinarily accommodative .  
We—and I won’ t go thro ugh the list again, but you know all the things that we have done to try 
to provide support to the economy .  I guess the question is, does it make sense to actively seek a 
higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased reduction —a slightly increased pace 
of reduction in the unem ployment rate ?  The view of the Committee  is that that would be very 
reckless .  We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low 
and stable inflation , which has proved extremely valuable in that we ’ve been be able to take 
strong accommodative actions in the last four  or five  years to support the economy without 
leading to a n unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation.  To ri sk that 
asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would 
be, I think, an unwise thing to do.  
KRISTINA PETERSON.  Thank you.  Given your warnings to lawmakers about the 
looming fiscal cliff, do you think the Fed has to take into account when Congress chooses  to take 
action ?  If they waited ’ til January , say, would you feel obligated to take into the —the potential 
economic blow into account?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I think we ’ll have to take fiscal policy into account to 
some extent, but I think it ’s very important to say that if no action were to be taken by the fiscal 
authorities, the size of the fiscal cliff is such that there ’s, I think, absolutely no chance that the 
Federal Reserve could or would have any  ability whatsoever to offset that effect on the economy .  
So I—as I have said many times before, it ’s imperative for Congress to give us a fiscal policy 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
9 of 23 
 that achieves two principal objectives .  The first is, of course, to achieve fiscal sustainability ove r 
the longer term ; that is critical, and that ’s something that needs to be addressed.  At the same 
time, I think that can be done in a way that doesn’ t endanger the short -term rec overy of the 
economy .  And I am  concern ed that if all the tax increases and spending cuts that are associated 
with the current law and which would take place —absent  any cong ressional action —were to 
occur o n January 1st, that that would be a significant risk to the recovery .  So I’m looking and 
hoping that Congress will take actions that will address both sides of that —both requirements of 
a good fiscal policy.  
JOSH ZUMBRUN.  Mr. Chairman , Josh Zumbrun from  Bloomberg News .  In today ’s 
statement you said , after coming quarters, you expect the econom y “to pick up gradually .”  Yet 
in the forecast that we got today, we see the forecast for 2013 and 2014, the growth forecast , is 
downgraded.  What caused you to downgrade your forecast for 2013 and 2014 when you see a 
pickup after the coming quarters?  
CHAI RMAN BERNANKE .  Well , again, these are the vi ews of the participants, the 
17 participants .  So the basic feature that is described in our statement , which is that growth 
seems likely to pick up over time , is still obviously in our projections .  The 2013 numbers are 
stronger than the 2012 numbers , and the 2014 numbers are stronger than the 2013 numbers .  And 
the reason for that expected pickup over  time is , first , a very accommodative monetary policy , 
which continues to provide support for the recovery .  But in addition, some of the headwinds that 
have been affecting our recovery —such as the housing market, financial stresses, credit 
tightness, and so on—some of those things we hope will be lifting over  time and will allow the 
economy to grow more quickly and approach more quickly its longer -run full employment level .  
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
10 of 23 
 The reason —I don’ t know precisely why there ’s been a slight downgrade in years further out, 
but I suspect that the fiscal issues may be part of that.  
ZACH GOLDFARB .  Mr. Chairman, you’ ve made th e inflation t arget  sound a little bit 
more like an inflation ceiling , and you suggested that a b reaching of that ceiling or target would 
hurt the Fed ’s credibility .  Can you explain a little bit more about why you think going 50 basis 
points or a full perc entage point  above the 2 percent target would hurt the Fed’ s credibility , and 
what that would do on the unemployment side if you were to do that?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So it ’s not a ceiling, it’ s a symmetric objective , and we 
attempt to bring inflation close  to 2 percent .  And in particular, if inflation were to jump for 
whatever reason —and we don’ t have, obviously don’ t have perfect control of inflation—we ’ll 
try to return inflation to 2 percent at a pace which takes into account the situation with respect to 
unemployment .  The risk of higher inflation— you say 2½ percent ; well, 2 ½ percent expected 
change might involve a distribution of outcome s, some of which might be much higher than 
2½ percent .  And the concern we have is that if inflation were to run well  above 2 percent for a 
protracted period , that the credibility and the well- anchored inflation expectations , which are 
such a valuable asset of the Federal Reserve, might become eroded , in which case we would in 
fact have less rather than more flexibility to use accommodat ive monetary policy to achieve our 
employment goals .  I would cite to you, just as an example, if you look at Vice Chair Yellen ’s 
paper, which she gave— or speech , which she gave a couple of weeks ago, where she described a 
number of ways o f looking at the late 2014 guidance .  She showed there some so -called optimal 
policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models , and what  you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, 
assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions —still 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
11 of 23 
 involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent .  So there is no presumption even in our 
econometric models that you need inflation well above target in or der to make progress on 
unemployment.  
PETER BARNES .  Peter Barnes, Fox News, sir.   For those of us who try to make a living 
out of parsing these statements noted that in the section on strains in global financial markets, the 
Committee  said this time around, “S trains in global financial markets continue to pose significant 
downside risks to the economic outlook.”   But in January, the Committee  said that the strains 
were easing .  What are we to read into this apparent change?  A re strain s tightening now ?  And 
what is your assessment of the situation in Europe with the debt crisis —are authorities there 
adequately addressing the debt  crisis ?  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, it’ s just supposed to be a factual description of what ’s 
happe ning in the environment .  In January , the financial markets had calmed  considerably , 
reflecting a number of steps taken in Europe , including , notably , the two  large long- term 
refinancing operations by the European Central Bank, which helped finance Europe ’s banks for 
up to three years .  In recent weeks, we ’ve seen more market stress arising from concerns about 
the fiscal positions of Spain and Italy , and, you know, we ’ve seen more volatility in our own 
markets related to that .  So we ’re simply taking note of the fact that a portion of the improvement 
that we saw late last year and early this year in European financial markets and in our own 
financial markets has been reversed recently, nothing more intended than that .  As you know, I 
had the opportunity over the weekend to speak with many of my European and other international colleagues because we had the G –20 and the IMF meetings here in Washington, 
and so we had plenty of opportunities to discuss the European situation.  I think it ’s true that the 
Europeans have made substantial progress overall .  I include not only the two  LTRO operations , 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
12 of 23 
 but also the Greek debt deal, the work on the fiscal compact, and recently the setting up of a 
larger financial firewall that could be used to avo id contagion should another country face 
serious financial distress .  So progress has been made, but obviously, judging by market 
conditions, there ’s still more work to be done , and we are counting on our European colleagues 
to continue to follow through t heir commitments and to put very strong effort into addressing 
what remain significant problems and concerns in Europe.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, two 
questions .  First, to follow up on Steve ’s point about the interest rate forecast earlier:  There are 
now only four FOMC participants who forecast that rates will still be close to zero at the end of 2014.  Given that you said the Committee  is entirely happy with that language in the statement, 
what information can we then take from the forecasts when they change like that ?  The second 
point —sorry —if you were to decide you wanted to do more to support the economy at some 
point, could you run us through the set of feasible options to do that ?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERN ANKE .  Sure .  Well, if you compare this set of forecasts with 
January, you’ll  see that a few members have pulled in their expected date.  But let me just 
reiterate that, once again, that these are just inputs into a decision process .  They represent 
individual estimates , and , quite admittedly, as many of the participants said around the table, you 
know, these are uncertain from an individual point of view .  And as we discussed the range of 
considerations, including the fact that we remain uncertain about how the economy is going to evolve, I ’ve talked about, for example, the so- called Okun’ s law puzzle about whether or not 
unemployment will continue fall quickly or whether it will begin to level out.  Given those uncertainties, given the risks like the  European situation or the fiscal cliff that we ’ve just 
discussed here , that there was a quite reasonable case for maintaining the guidance at late 2014 .  
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
13 of 23 
 And as I said, there was a great deal of comfort among the participants and the Committee  
members with maintaining this guidance.  
GREG ROBB .  Thank you.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com .  Judging from some of the 
speeches lately from Fed officials, it looks like too- big-to-fail is —they view this as the next step 
where attention should be paid and work should be done .  There ’s even a proposal to have 
legislation to force bank divestitures .  Could you talk about your views on these things ?  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Yes .  I believe that too -big-to-fail was an important cause, 
or at least a propagating mechan ism, of the financial crisis .  And I believe it ’s absolutely 
incumbent upon us to do all we can to eliminate too- big-to-fail.  And what I mean by that is , a 
situation where a failing firm is bailed out because its collapse would have such adverse 
circumstance—consequences for the rest of the financial system .  So we are working to get rid of 
too-big-to-fail, and I think making some progress .   
First of all,  we are very substantially increasing the supervisory and regulatory oversight 
of large financial institutions ; that includes, for example, the Basel III rules that require higher 
capital for all banks but particularly for systemically important banks, mor e liquidity 
requirements , stress tests, a range of tougher supervisory requirements that are—many of them 
are embedded in the rule we put out on 165–166, that section of the Dodd– Frank Act .  So the 
first thing we ’re going to do is make sure that these larg e institutions are stronger , that it’ s much 
harder for them to fail , and that they are watched much more carefully and more actively by the 
supervisors .   
The other part of eliminating too -big-to-fail, though, is that , in that circumstance where a 
large co mplex financial firm does come to the brink of failure , that it must be allowed to fail; it 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
14 of 23 
 must be safe to fail.  And in that respect, one of the principal tools that we’ve gotten from Dodd–
Frank is a so -called o rderly l iquidation a uthority, which is the FDIC’s tool, and the Federal 
Reserve is working closely with the FDIC there .  The idea is to apply the same kind of bank 
resolution tools that the FDIC has used for many years on domestic banks to large complex financial firms .   
Now, obviously, the comple xity and the international aspects of these firms make that a 
much more challenging task, but I think we ’re making progress there .  We have put out rules 
about so- called living wills, which will require large financial firms to essentially plan out how 
they would be disassembled .  And we ’ve continued to talk with international colleagues about 
how we would cooperate if a multinational firm had to be put into receivership.  And , indeed, 
part of the reason that there ’s been some downgrade or potential downgra de for some U.S. 
financial institutions is the judgment of the ratings agencies that the so -called implicit 
government support that these institutions have is less than in the past .  And so, I think, 
ultimately , what we’ ll need to have is a situation where  large firms are both making judgments 
about their size and complexity based only on the economic benefits and costs and not on too-big-to-fail considerations, and that if there is failure, that it can be done and achieved without 
highly adverse consequenc es for the financial system and the economy .  And that ’s our 
objective , and that ’s the way , I think, to end too- big-to-fail. 
CATHERINE HOLLANDER .  You ’ve been working hard to improve communications 
with both markets and the general public .  What ’s your assessment of how both is done?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I think that ’s part of your job to say .  I think we ’re 
making progress .  I think it was an important step to make clear what our inflation objective is —
I thought that was important .  And we p ut out a statement that described the overall policy 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
15 of 23 
 approach of the Federal Reserve.  We ’ve taken a number of steps to improve communication, 
including these press conferences, of course.  But also, by expanding our projections and by 
continued, you know, work doing press —doing ,sorry , doing testimonies and speeches, and most 
recently as you know, I did some classes —I taught some classes at a local university .   
So we ’re doing our best both—to achieve, really, two objectives .  One is to help make the 
Fed a little bit more understandable to the average person, because many people don’ t 
understand all the arcane aspects of the Federal Reserve and of monetary policy .  And to be good 
voters and good citizens, they need to understand, you know, something about what the Fed 
does.  And also, to communicate with markets so that markets can better appreciate, you know, 
what our monetary policy plans are in order so that interest rates and other asset prices can appropriately reflect those plans .  I think the evidence on the latter point is that there is a better 
understanding of the Fed ’s policies .  And, you know, we ’ve seen, for example, less volatility in 
interest rates related to greater certainty about what the Fed is likely to do .   
But I want to emphasize that this is an ongoing task, it ’s a work in progress , and we ’re 
going to continue to look for ways to make ourselves better understand— more understandable 
and more transparent to the public. 
GREG IP .  Greg Ip of the  Economist .  First, assume that you are not c onstrained by the 
zero nominal bound right now .  What would the federal funds rate be , even if it were a negative 
number ?  And do you believe that you are at an equivalent degree of monetary accommodation 
today using your unconventional tools ?  And also, a  quick supplemental —could you put some 
numbers on what —on the meaning of “ exceptionally low ” federal funds rate ?  For example, 
would a 1 percent federal funds rate qualify as “ exceptionally low ” at the end of 2014?  
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
16 of 23 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, the exact reading for the federal funds rate today, in 
the absence of the zero lower bound, would depend a lot on which particular rule, what particular 
model that you use .  I don ’t want to cite a particular number, but it probably would be negative .  
And in that respect, we are trying to compensate for that by the use of nonstandard tools , 
including, as you know, almost a $3 trillion balance sheet .   
We see monetary policy as being approximately in the right place at this point, based on 
the analysis that we’ ve been doing in —of the economy and  the outlook.  That doesn’ t mean we 
might not take further action ; we are certainly prepared to take further action .  But for the time 
being, it appears that we are more or less in the right place.  
GREG I P.  “Exceptionally low ”? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  “Exceptionally low ”; you know, one of the reasons that 
language in the statement is sometimes a little vaguer than you would like is because we are trying to get a consensus among 17 or at least 10 people, and different members or participants in the FOMC might have somewhat different views of what “ exceptionally low ” means .  
Personally, I think it means something close to where we are —where we are now.  
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker .  To follow up on the 
too-big-to-fail question, there has been acute discussion in recent months about calling for 
breaking up the banks even louder than before, even including some Fed officials .  And you just 
talked about the need to eliminate too- big-to-fail.  Of course, Dodd–Frank —that ’s the intent of 
it.  My question is twofold:  Do you agree ?  And is there an argument to be made for breaking up 
the banks ?  And is that something that the Fed should consider when weighing the importance of 
financial stability ?  And , sort of , to this earlier point that you made is, what in your view is the 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
17 of 23 
 litmus test that will allow us to know that we can achieve ending too -big-to-fail through Dodd–
Frank?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, there may be circumstances where a bank or financial 
institution is artificially large .  And in that context, if it were posing a severe threat to financial 
stability, then I suppose that considering breaking it up would be something that regulators 
should look at .  My own view , though, is th at a more market -responsive way to address this 
problem is to eliminate the incentive to be too -big-to-fail.  That is , to—through tougher 
supervisory oversight, through higher capital requirements, through greater liquidity requirements, through restrictio ns on interconnectedness , et cetera, take away the benefits or 
force firms to internalize the costs of being large and complex .  And on the other side, as I was 
saying earlier, if we can safely unwind a failing firm, then we no longer have too- big-to-fail, 
obviously, and so I think that ’s a very, very important objective .  The test would be that the 
financial markets that lend to large firms base their bond spreads and what they ’re willing to pay 
for the stock of those firms solely on the risk- taking and on the business model of those firms 
and not on the fact that there ’s some anticipation of a government bailout .  And so I think market 
indicators will help us see our progress towards ending too- big-to-fail. 
STEVE BECKNER .  Steve Beckner of Market News Inte rnational .  Mr. Chairman, good 
to see you .  There’ s been some concern in markets about what will happen to bond yields at the 
expiration of Operation Twist on June 30th and some speculation on what the Fed might do—might need to do to keep downward pressure on yields .  Is that a concern that you share?  A nd do 
you and your colleagues feel the need not to disappoint these kinds of market expectations?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, to your last point, the purpose of monetary policy is 
to achieve our object ives of maximum employment and price stability , it’s not to disappoint or 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
18 of 23 
 not disappoint investors .  So we will take actions based on those economic objectives and not try 
to achieve certain market outcomes .   
There’ s some disagreement, I think, about exac tly how balance sheet actions by the 
Federal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices .  The view that we have generally 
taken at the Fed , in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’ s the 
quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases —the flow of 
new purchases —which is the primary determinant of interest rates .  And if that theory is correct, 
then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minim al effects 
on interest rates at that time .  And that , in fact , has been our —generally our experience in 
previous episodes where we have launched a program and then allowed it to come to a natural 
end.   
Of course, we ’ll continue to monitor the situation , and if we believe that financial 
conditions for whatever reason are inconsistent with our macroeconomic objectives, then we will act to fix that.  But , again, our expectation is that , at whatever point that the purchases end, that 
financial markets being qu ite forward looking will have anticipated that, and that the effects 
ought to be moderate.  
AKIO FUJII .  Thank you, Chairman.  I am Akio Fujii from Nikkei  newspaper .  My 
question is follow -up for your comment about Japan and U.S .  Now, are you confident U.S. 
economy would avoid long -term stagnation like we had in Japan, or so- called Japanization ?  And 
if it’s the case, only policy response make a difference of Japan and U.S., or are there any other 
factor make difference?  
CHAIRMAN BERNA NKE .  The last part again —are there measures?  
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
19 of 23 
 AKIO FUJII .  Yes, policy response is the only reason make a difference U.S. and Japan 
or are there any other factor make a difference of U.S. and Japan situation?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I think the —I would draw two distinctions between 
the U.S. and Japan, or the Japanese experience .  The first is that, as I mentioned earlier —and I 
think this is very important —is that we acted aggressively and preemptively to avoid deflation.  
Now, of course , Japan had a much bigger bubble and a much bigger shock when the bubble 
collapsed , and so these differences may be certainly understandable .  But, again, we did avoid 
deflation .  The other thing which I think we have done reasonably well here in the United States 
was that we moved fairly quickly to make sure that our banks were recapitalized and were 
recognizing their bad assets .  And I think the stress tests that we conducted last month are good 
evidence that the U.S. banking system is considerably stronger and, indeed , much more resilient 
than it was a couple of years ago .   
So those two things are positives and would tend to suggest that we will avoid some of 
the problems that Japan has faced .  That being said, I think it ’s always better to be humble and 
just to, you know , avoid being too confident .  And we need to continue to maintain a strong 
monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns 
to a more normal situation.  
SCOTT SPOERRY .  Scott Spoerry with CNNMoney, sir .  I wante d to ask you about the 
labor force participation rate .  It’s at the lowest level since the early ’ 80s.  Can you talk about 
why people are dropping out of the job market, whether it ’s a permanent structural problem , and 
what convinces you that things may ch ange?  If I could just a pop a second question to follow up 
on Steve and the bonds —your colleague Sheila Bair wrote this week that her —about her concern 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
20 of 23 
 over being in a bond bubble .  She said you should declare victory, and you should do something 
about puncturing that bubble before it gets too much out of control .  Can you respond to that too?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  On declaring victory, I think it ’s a little premature to 
declare victory .  I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our e conomy .  As 
for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons ; they include monetary policy , of 
course , but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations , and safe -haven 
demands for U.S. T reasuries .  So, of course , interest rates will rise at some point.  We hope that 
they do because that would be an indication that the economy is recovering and strengthening .  
And I think it ’s important for holders of long -term securities to manage their risks and pay 
attention to that .  But all that being said, I think , again , that there are both good reasons to 
continue monetary ease and good reasons for interest rates to be low .  The f irst part of your 
question was — 
SCOTT SPOERRY.  About the —  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Oh, participatio n, labor participation, yes .  Actually , we had 
a very good discussion of that at the meeting be cause it is an important issue , trying to assess 
how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical , and so on.  There is , 
in fact , a downw ard trend in labor participation in the United States .  It comes from , first , the fact 
that we ’re no longer getting increased participation from women; f emale participation has 
leveled out .  And , secondly , because, as the society ages , and also for other reasons, male 
participation has been declining over  time .  So there is a downward trend that we have to take 
into account .   
The participants at the meeting, at least some of them , suggested, though, that a good bit 
of the decline in participation that we ’ve seen in the last few years does represent cyclical 
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
21 of 23 
 factors .  Much of it is young people , for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force 
indefinitely , but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else 
rather than working .  So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall 
as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, 
many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for wor k, which I think 
would be a good thing .  But we ’ll just have to see .  But I do think— I think I would agree with 
the argument that a significant part of the decline over and above the downward trend in the participation rate is reflecting cyclical factors a nd should reverse when the economy gets 
stronger .   
DON LEE .  Don Lee f rom the L.A. Times .  Can you give us your assessment of the 
impact of the mild winter weather on job growth and what that might mean going forward?  And related to that, I think you sai d last month that some of the recent job gains reflected a catch -up 
from outsize cuts right after the recession .  I mean, given those two things, what kind of job 
growth can we expect?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, the weather issue just reflects how difficult it can be 
to make real -time assessments of the state of the economy .  The weather has probably affected a 
number of things .  It probably brought forward some of the hiring so that it made perhaps 
January and February artificially strong and March perhaps artificially a little bit weak .  It 
probably affected construction, manufacturing .  There’ s a number of things that were probably 
affected to some extent by the unusually warm weather that we had this winter , and we ’re doing 
our best to try to adjust for that .  We ’re also looking at some of the seasonality issues that have 
arisen because of the unusually large recession in 2008 and 2009.  So , again, that makes the data 
harder to interpret .   
April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL   
 
22 of 23 
 I advance d the hypothesis that the increase in employment we ’ve seen in the last five, six 
months might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a 
one-time catch -up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009.  That ’s only a hypothesis .  
We’ll have to see going forward .  If it’s correct , then job gains will be somewhat less than the 
250,000 a month that we ’ve been seeing recently .  But we don’ t know yet , we don’ t know yet .  
And I wouldn’ t draw too much conclusion from the March report .  I think, again , because of 
weather and ot her factors, we really can ’t take a conclusive result from that.  So, we ’ll continue 
to be watching the labor market .  That ’s a very important consideration.  If unemployment looks 
like it’ s no longer making progress, that ’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy 
options. 
DON LEE .  What kind of job growth, on average , is consistent with the unemployment 
projections that you ’ve made?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, we need something —estimates differ .  We need 
fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past —I suppose more 
like 100,000 a month for stability .  I don’ t have an exact answer, but broadly speaking, 150–
200,000 jobs or so.  But that ’s a very rough estimate, and , of course, individual participants ma y 
have different views .   
Again, that ’s not a forecast, I ’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower 
improvement in unemployment .  But the possibility , of course , exists that this recovery will 
generate a virtuous circle with greater hiring, which in t urn generates more consumer spending , 
and greater hiring , and so on.  That remains to be seen , and , of course , which way that goes is 
going to be a very important determinant of our response.

 PETER COOK .  Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  Thank you for 
the time .  First up, sir, on the projections —in your bid for transparency , for more openness here 
at the Fed, would you consider , in the future, you and your colleagues actually attaching your 
name to the projections here so that , again, markets, folks out in the —watching your actions get 
a better sense of exactly what you ’re thinking in the future, what your colleagues are thinking ?  
And separately , sir, as you consider where you are at this moment, all you ’ve been through with 
the financial crisis , the recovery, what is it right now that most frustrates you about this recovery, 
that still confounds you most about this recovery, that confuses you most?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, those things are not all the same .  On the former, our  
subcommittee , headed by Vice Chair Yellen, is looking at the SEP for ways to improve 
transparency, and we ’re looking at everything .  So, your particular suggestion is on the table , as 
are other ways to try to make this more useful .  And, again, it ’s a wor k in progress , as I said 
before .   
The most frustrating aspect, I guess, of the recovery has been that it ’s—has been that it ’s 
been quite slow .  And as a result, here we are, almost three years from the beginning of the 
expansion, and the unemployment rate  is still over 8 percent .  So we ’re looking and hoping that 
as the headwinds lift, as financial stresses ease, as housing improves , that we ’ll begin to get more 
rapid improvement in the economy and in the labor market .  But it has been a very long slog, an d 
that, I think, would be the single most concerning thing .  From a policy perspective, there are 
many issues , like the fiscal issues , for example.  But within the province of the Federal Reserve, 
I think it would be the pace of improvement in the labor market.  
Thank you.

 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference 
June 20, 2012 
 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Good afternoon.  Before we get to questions, I ’ll summarize 
today ’s policy action by the Federal Open Market Committee and then place the C ommittee ’s 
decision in the context of our economic outlook and our collective judgment about the 
appropriate path of monetary policy .   
As indicated in the statement released earlier this afternoon, the C ommittee is 
maintaining a highly accommodative policy .  We decided to keep the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and we continue to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 2014 .  In addition, 
the C ommittee decided to co ntinue through the end of the year our program of lengthening the 
maturity of our sec urities  holdings rather than completing the program this month as previously 
scheduled .  Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining  
maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less .  The detail s of 
our plans  for our securities  purchases and sales were described in an accompanying statement 
released today and can  be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’ s website .  The 
continuation of the maturity extension p rogram should put downward pressure on longer -term 
interest rates and make broader financial condit ions more accommodative than they would 
otherwise be, thereby supporting economic recovery.   
In conjunction with today ’s meeting, FOMC participants —the 7 Board members and the 
12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted their individual economic projections and policy 
assessments for the years 2012 to 2014 and over the longer run.  These projections are important 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
2 of 22 
 inputs to the C ommittee ’s deliberations .  Incoming information suggests that the economy 
continues to expand at a moderate pace in the face of headwinds  generated by the situation in 
Europe, a still -depressed housing market, tight credit for some borrowers, and fiscal restraint at 
the federal, state, and local levels .  Business and household spending are increasing at rates 
consistent with moderate econom ic growth, though household spending appears to be rising at a 
somewhat slower pace than earlier this year .  Employment gains have been smaller in recent 
months , and the unemployment rate , at 8.2 percent , remains elevated .  In light of these 
developments, C ommittee participants have generally marked down their projections for 
economic growth, but most still see the economy as expanding at a moderate pace over coming 
quarters and then picking up gradually .   
Based on their projections for economic growth, FO MC participants foresee slower 
progress in reducing unemployment than they did in April .  Committee participants ’ projections 
for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year have a central tendency of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 7.0 perce nt to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 , levels that would 
remain above participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal rates of unemployment .  In 
addition to projecting only slow progress in bringing down unemployment, most participants see the risks to the outlook weighted mainly toward slower growth and higher unemployment .  In 
particular, participants noted that strains in global financial markets, associated principally with the situation in Europe, continue to pose significant risks  to the re covery and to further 
improvement in labor market conditions .   
Meanwhile, inflation has declined recently, primarily reflecting lower prices of crude oil 
and gasoline .  Longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable, and the C ommittee 
anticipates  that inflation over the medium  run will run at or below the 2 percent rate that it judges 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
3 of 22 
 most consistent with its statutory mandate for maximum employment and price stability .  More 
specifically, participants ’ projections of  inflation have a central tend ency of 1.2 to 1.7 percent for 
2012 and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for 2014.  The economic projections submitted by FOMC 
participants are conditioned on their  individual assessments of the appropriate path of monetary 
policy .  As you can see from the chart, C ommittee participants have a range of views about when 
the initial increase in the federal funds rate is likely to be warranted .   
After a thorough discussion of those views , and of the ongoing uncertainty and risks 
surrounding the outlook, the FOMC —as I mentioned —maintained its collective judgment that 
economic conditions are likely to warrant  exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at 
least through late 2014, and it agreed to provide further support to the economy by continuing the m aturity e xtension program .  The C ommittee is prepared to take further action as appropriate 
to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability .   
Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions.  
STEVE LIESMAN.   Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Mr. Chairman, looking back on the last 
four years of Fed policy, I think it ’s probably fair to say it has been bold and yet at the same time 
halting .  You did QE1 and then you stopped and then you did QE2.  You did “ Operation T wist” 
and you told us it was going to end in June ; now you’ ve extended it .  How would you respond if , 
several years from now, a young MIT graduate student came forward and said, “ You know what 
the problem with Fed  policy was during this period is it was too incremental, and that the reason 
why the economy underperformed was because of that incrementalism.”   And what do you think 
the dangers are right now that today ’s action is also too incremental?  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
4 of 22 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well , of course, you know, we cut the federal funds rate in 
a continuous fashion until December of 2008.  And since then, we ’ve been operating with 
nonsta ndard monetary  tools , including asset purchases and extension of maturities .  By their 
nature, these tend to be lumpy .  We haven ’t done them in a continuous way .  But our view of the 
effects of these programs on the economy is that the total stock of outstanding securities in our 
portfolio is what determines the level of accommodation that the economy is receiving .  So in 
that respect, it wouldn’ t be really a start and stop ; rather, whenever we have stopped purchasing , 
the level of accommodation that was already in the system remains there until conditions warrant further action .  Now, underlying all this, of course, is the fact that  the outlook has changed .  Like 
many other forecasters, the Federal Reserve was too optimistic early in the recovery about the pace of recovery .  And we ’ve had to add additional accommodation going forward, as we have 
seen, in fact , that the headwinds have  kept the recovery from being as strong as we would like .  
But, again, by the nature of these unconventional tools, they are —tend to be more discreet in 
their size , but they continue to have accommodative effects even after the pattern of purchases 
has end ed. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Don ’t you worry about incrementalism now?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, we ’ve taken a step today , which is a substantive step , 
which will provide additional accommodation for the economy .  And , moreover, we have stated 
that we ’re prepared  to take further steps if necessary to promote sustainable growth and recovery 
in the labor market .  So, we are prepared to do what ’s necessary .  We are prepared to provide 
support for the economy.  
MARK FELSENTHAL.  Mark Felsenthal with Reuters .  Mr. Chair man, many analysts 
have characterized today ’s step as somewhat modest .  Your own outlook has a much lower GDP 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
5 of 22 
 projection.  The unemployment rate in your outlook is —shows possibly no improvement at all in 
the unemployment rate through the end of this year .  The program itself is smaller and of shorter 
duration than the original O peration T wist.  Given this weaker outlook, why such a modest 
program?  And when you say you are prepared to take further action, which is a stronger 
characterization than in your la st meeting, does that mean you are prepared to do a full -on new 
asset purchase program?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, there ’s been a great deal of economic news since our 
last meeting .  The incoming data were somewhat disappointing —but not entirely clear how t o 
read them .  We had issues with weather and seasonal adjustment and other factors .  Meanwhile, 
Europe has had additional problems .  We ’ve seen some of those effects in financial markets .  So, 
I think, there is some case to be made for making some additional judgments about where the economy is going .  That being said, the step we took, the extension of the maturity e xtension 
program , I think, is a substantive step , and it will provide some additional support .  And yes, 
additional asset purchases would be among the things that we would certainly consider if we need to take additional measures to strengthen the economy.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, I ’d 
like to ask you to respond to a different set of criticisms .  This criticism—whi ch you hear from 
Capitol Hill and  Wall Street and different places —is that the Fed has already pushed interest 
rates to an extraordinarily low level, a historically low level, and that there isn ’t anything more 
that the Fed can do to help the recovery .  That —the criticism is that the Fed at this point should 
stand down and let Congress or the White House attend to the economy ’s ailments or let market 
forces attend to the economy ’s ailments .  What do you think of those arguments , and how  would 
you respond to them?  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
6 of 22 
 CHAIRMAN BERNA NKE.  Well, as I ’ve said many times, monetary policy is not a 
panacea.  Monetary policy by itself is not going to solve our economic problems .  We welcome 
help and support from any other part of the government, from other economic policymakers .  So, 
collaboration is —would be great .  I wouldn’ t accept the proposition, though, that the Fed has no 
more ammunition .  I do think that our tools, while they are nonstandard, still can create 
more -accommodative financial cond itions, can still provide support for the economy, can still 
help us return to a more normal economic situation.  That being said , again, any other support  
that is forthcoming, any other economic policies that are undertaken that are helpful in terms of 
making our economy stronger are welcome .  But I do think that monetary policy still does have 
some capacity to strengthen the economy by easing financial con ditions.  
ZACH GOLDFARB.  Thank you.  Mitt Romney recently said that QE2 had a relatively 
little impact on the economy .  He said that was in part because of the P resident ’s policies, and he 
said that QE3 was unwarranted and could have negative effects .  Do you agree that QE2 had 
little effect on the economy?  Do you think the P resident ’s policies has had an effect on the 
effectiveness of monetary policy?  And do you think it ’s appropriate for a presidential candidate 
to comment on the future path of monetary  policy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I ’ll just say first that we think that both of the asset 
purchase programs, so -called QE1 and QE2, did have significant effects on asset prices and 
financial conditions .  And although there were certain problems in transm ission —for example, 
the housing market has not been as responsive as it ’s been in some times in the past —we do 
think that they were both effective in providing support for the economy , and in particular, so-
called QE2 ended what looked to be an incipient deflation problem when we first introduced it .  
So, I do think those have been eff ective , and as I said to Mr. Hils enrath, we think that these kinds 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
7 of 22 
 of programs can still provide additional support .  With respect to the rest of your questions, I just 
want t o reiterate that the Federal Reserve is nonpartisan, we are very serious about taking our 
decisions based on purely economic grounds without political considerations, and we ’ll continue 
to do that. 
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Thanks .  Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times.  Long -term 
interest rates, mortgage rates are already at historic lows .  How much more help can an extension 
of Operation T wist do and—to lower interest rates?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the interest rates are quite low , and they ’re being 
pushed down more by safe -haven flows and other factors .  That being said, I think we can lower 
interest rates more .  But beyond that, Operation T wist and asset purchases work also through 
other channels .  In particular, by acquiring securities in the market and bringi ng them onto the 
Fed’s balance sheet , we essentially induce investors to move into substitute  securities .  So, for 
example, an investor who sells a T reasury security to the Fed may end up buying a corporate 
bond instead, and so the effect will be to lower corporate bond rates and corporate spreads .  Or a 
bank may, having sold its T reasury securities, may decide to make a loan instead .  So, it ’s not 
just the effect on the long- term interest rate, but there ’s a broader set of effects that feed through 
other a sset prices, other interest rates, other spreads, and provide a broader ease in financial 
conditions which is supportive to the economy.  
JEFF KEARNS.  Thank you.  Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg News .  Given the projections 
today going out to ’ 14, seeing  unempl oyment almost where it is now for another two  years, can 
you look past 2014, and can you—now that we ’re five  years past the top of the stock market, six  
years past the top of the housing market, can this go on for a decade?  Can this go on longer?  
Can you reassure Americans that it won ’t go on for a dozen years like the D epression ? 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’ s our intention to do all we can to make sure that it 
doesn’ t go on indefinitely .  Unemployment is still too high , but it has come down.  It was abo ut 
10 percent at the peak , and now it ’s closer to 8 percent .  It’s going down too slowly , but it is 
going down.  Our sense is that people are finding jobs , but just not at the rate that we would like 
to see.  And, you know, as I said, and as the statement says, if we don’ t see continued 
improvement in the labor market, we ’ll be prepared to take additional steps if appropriate.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum,  New York Times .  I’m looking at the 
projections you all released today that show that unemploy ment will be between 8 and 
8.2 percent at the end of the year .  You told Congress earlier this month that the defining factor 
in your decision about whether to do more would be whether  unemployment was coming down.  
That’s barely a decrease.  And I guess I ’m struggling to understand why , in that context, you are 
not doing more now , particular ly when you say that  you can do more and that you would do 
more if it wasn ’t happening.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first of all, again, we are—we did take a substantive 
step today by extending the m aturity extension program to the end of the year .  Again, I think 
that’s a meaningful additional step. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The projections  included that step, right?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It depends on— each individual has their own path of 
optimal policy , so we ’ll provide more information about that in the minutes .  But —and again, 
we’re prepared to do more .  We have to get, I think, further information about the state of the 
economy, about where things  are going, about what ’s happening in Europe .  I guess I would add 
to that, though, that, you know, each of these nonstandard programs does have various costs and 
risks associated with it with respect to market functioning, with respect to financial stability, with 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
9 of 22 
 respect to the exit process, and so I don’ t think they should be launched lightly .  I think there 
should be some conviction that they ’re needed, but if we do come to that conviction, then we ’ll 
take those additional steps. 
KRISTINA PETERSON.  Kri stina Peterson , Dow Jones .  I know  that you’ ve said that 
European policymakers are the first line of defense for the European debt crisis, but under what 
circumstances would the Fed decide to get more directly involved or coordinate action with other centr al banks?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as you say, the Europeans are the first line .  Europe is 
a wealthy area.  They have adequate resources to address these problems .  They are very 
committed to addressing these problems because keeping the e uro zone together, keeping the 
euro-zone trading bloc together is very important to the economies of those countries, so we 
leave to them the leadership .  The Federal Reserve is very much involved in talking with and 
consulting with European leaders .  I talk frequently to central bankers in Europe, including 
Mario Draghi and others .  We try to provide whatever help and support we can.  We did , of 
course , coordinate earlier in the provision of the dollar swaps to other central banks, which have 
been useful in reducin g pressures in dollar funding markets and allowing European banks to 
continue lending in dollars , including to U .S. borrowers .  So, at this point , we are consulting 
frequently .  We are prepared to work together if that can be done constructively .  But at this 
point, you know, we are mostly just in consultation mode. 
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business .  Sir, you had talked about trying to get 
maybe a little help from some of the other branches of government , so that leads to the questions 
about the “ fiscal cliff .”  Have you seen any evidence that the lack of progress on resolving the 
fiscal -cliff issue is having an impact on the economy right now?  Is it slowing economic growth 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
10 of 22 
 right now, job creation as we saw last year during this very same debate ?  And if you’ re not 
seeing it, and if you haven’ t seen it yet, when could we —might we start to see it hit the economy 
and hurt the economy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it’ s still a bit early, but as we move forward in 
the year, we do anticipate that the uncertainty associated with the so -called fiscal cliff will have 
some economic effects .  We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be 
government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contract s would still be 
in place come January and making employment decisions based on that .  More generally, 
financial markets don ’t like uncertainty and, particularly, uncertainty of this magnitude , and that, 
I think, will be a negative .  So that uncertainty is there, that ’s goi ng to be an issue .  I think most 
importantly , though, is that Congress get the policy right .  I’ve talked about three elements for 
fiscal policy .  The first is to do no harm as far as the recovery is concerned, to try to avoid a 
fiscal cliff that would sig nificantly damage the recovery .  But second, to maintain the effort to 
achieve a sustainable fiscal path over the longer term .  And third, to use fiscal policy 
effectively —to have a better tax code, to make good use of government spending programs and 
make them efficient and effective, and so on.  So I think if Congress does all those things, the 
ultimate benefits would be substantial. 
PETER COOK.  Peter Cook with  Bloomberg Television.  If I could follow up on my 
colleague Peter Barnes ’s question regarding the fiscal cliff, just listening to your answer here, 
how beneficial would it be for the U .S. economy right now, given some of the ta lk on Capitol 
Hill that the law makers and the A dministration deal with the fiscal -cliff issues, perhaps 
temporarily kick th e can down the road into next year, deal with i t sooner rather than later .  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
11 of 22 
 Would that end —limit, at least , some of that uncertainty in the short  term ?  Would that  be 
beneficial given the state of the economy at this present moment?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, that’ s a difficult problem .  I’m not entirely sure .  On 
the one hand, a little clarity would probably be helpful for the reasons that I described, because 
people are uncertain about what ’s going to happen.  On the other hand, investors I know would 
like to see Congress take actions that put us on a long -term, sustainable fiscal path , and simply 
kicking the can down the road without any other indication of what might be done, what kinds of policies might be enacted , could be a negative for sentiment be cause it might induce people to 
worry more about the seriousness of Congress in addressing our fiscal issues. 
SHAHIEN NASIRIPOUR.  Shah ien Nasiripour with the Financial Times .  Mr. 
Chairman, one crit ique of the Fed ’s accommodative actions over the past few  years has been  that 
it’s helped those with the least propensity to spend —the wealthy , large businesses and 
corporations —while the Fed ’s impact on those with the most propensity to spen d—the cash -
strapped and  middle -income households —has been muted.  I was  hoping that you could perhaps 
address this criticism, particularly with a focus on access to credit.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Sure .  Well, access to credit is a major issue , there’ s no 
question about it .  Mortgage access is much tighter than it ’s been for a lo ng time .  Even credit 
card access is more restricted than it has been in the past .  And that —what that does is , to some 
extent , it mutes the impact of the Fed ’s actions .  That being said, I don’ t think it’ s at all accurate 
to say that Federal Reserve polic y is not helping the broad public .  First of all, many Americans 
are able to take advantage of lower interest rates .  Many people have refinanced or bought 
homes .  Others have taken out loans to buy cars .  Auto loans are cheap and broadly available .  
So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
12 of 22 
 effects .  If a firm has a low cost of capital, and we ’ve seen a lot of corporate borrowing in the last 
couple of years, then they ’re more likely to expand, to add c apital, to add products , and , 
consequently, they are more likely to hire .  And although, again, the extent to which the payrolls 
have increased in the last few years has been disappointing , there have been significant increases , 
and the unemployment rate has come down by 2 percentage points .  Some of that comes from the 
broad impact of Fed policy on spending , on investment , and those effects affect the broad public 
indirectly by promoting hiring and by promoting demand for products that people are producing . 
KEVIN HALL.   Hi, thanks .  Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers .  If you could flesh 
out a little bit more detail about what —where you think the choke points are in the economy .  
SIFMA yesterday had their midyear outlook conference call in which they blamed a full 
percentage point of the slowdown on fiscal cliff and, more importantly , Europe and said, you 
know, much bigger pass -through than anyone anticipated .  Today , the Business Roundtable said, 
Europe , not so much;  it’s basically the economy .  The CEO of Boeing said, clearly , we’re 
already t rimming  jobs, we ’re already cutting back ; everybody else in the a erospace, he thinks, is 
doing the same .  What are you hearing?  Are you on t he phone with people  your predecessor was 
given to calling  occasionally ?  What is your sense of where the choke points are that are 
continuing to thwart  hiring?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Sure .  I gave a list of  some of the headwinds in my opening 
remarks .  I do think that the European situation is slowing U .S. economic growth.  First of all, 
Europe is , if not in a recession in every country, certainly many countries are in recession, and 
that affects our trade with Europe and the demand for our products .  More br oadly, the effects of 
European concerns on financial markets have added to volatility, have brought down stock prices, have increased credit spreads, and generally have been a negative for economic growth .  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
13 of 22 
 So that has been an issue .  And more broadly, we ’ve seen some slowing in global economic 
growth more generally , including in Asia , which also has reduced somewhat our ability to 
export .  So that ’s one set of concerns that ’s been important .  I’d mentioned two others, I think, as 
being primarily important.  One is housing .  Housing usually plays a very important role in 
economic recovery, both through construction itself and related industries, but also because 
higher house prices increase consumer wealth and promote consumer spending .  Housing does 
seem to  be doing somewhat better .  There are some good signs in housing , but nevertheless , we 
are not getting the size of the boost, the amount of help in the recovery that we would normally get from a housing recovery .  The other area is, as you indicated, is fi scal.  And that happens at 
all different levels :  federal, state, and local .  Notwithstanding programs earlier on, in the last 
year or two  and going forward we have been seeing fiscal consolidation.  P articularly at the state 
and local level , of course, ti ght budgets have led to a lot of layoffs and cancellation of projects 
and so on.  I understand that these are necessary steps from the perspective of individual states 
and localities .  I’m not criticizing that;  it’s just a fact, though, that these contract ions are 
affecting the pace of growth in the broader economy .  So I think those would be the main things I 
would point to, and put them all together , and you have an economy which is growing less 
quickly than it normally would following  a recession of the magnitude that we saw.  
MARCY GORDON.  Thank you.  Marcy Gordon with the AP .  Given the environment 
that you’ ve sketched out and the fact that interest rates are at historically low points, would it 
make sense—would it be an option for t he government to issue more long -term debt at this point 
and take advantage of that?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the government is very gradually increasing the 
duration of its debt —the T reasury , I mean —and it ’s been doing that for some period of time .  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
14 of 22 
 Ther e’s a bit of an issue here , which is that what the Federal Reserve is doing with the program 
we announced today, the maturity extension p rogram , is we ’re taking longer -term debt off the 
market in order to induce investors to move into other assets  and to l ower longer -term interest 
rates .  To the extent that the T reasury actively sought to lengthen duration of its borrowing, it 
would, to some extent, offset the benefits of that —of those policies .  So my understanding of 
what the T reasury is doing is that the y have a plan, they ’re sticking to that plan, and therefore , on 
the margin , the effects of the Fed ’s actions can be felt.  
DARREN GERSH.   Darren Gersh with Nightly Business Report .  You clearly seem to be 
waiting on the labor market .  Can you be a little mo re specific?  What exactly are you looking 
for?  Is there a rate of job growth you need to look —to see?   And also, if the unemployment rate 
comes down, is that enough?  O r are you going to also look at labor participation and  the whole 
gestalt ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, I can ’t give you any specific numbers because this is 
ultimately a C ommittee decision, but what the C ommittee is going to do is review all the labor 
market indicators , including unemployment, including participation , and other measures of labor 
market activity , and try to make a sense—try to get a sense of whether or not the labor market is 
improving in a sustainable way .  It’s not a month- to-month proposition.  You know, this year 
already, we’ ve seen a few months of very strong job gains , and we saw two  months of weaker 
gains .  Obviously, month to  month, there is going to be statistical noise —there is going to be 
weather, there ’s going to be a lot of factors that can cause job gains to vary .  So the question is, is 
the improvement sustainable?  Is it long  lasting?  That ’s the kind of thing that we ’ll be looking 
at, but I really can ’t be too much more specific than that.

 STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner , Market News International .  Mr. Chairman, when 
we—when you speak of the fiscal cliff , typically you don’ t differentiate between the automatic 
tax-hike aspect of that and the automatic spending cuts , which leaves the impression that you are 
giving equal weight to both sides .  Some would contend that the automatic tax hikes would be 
more one rous.  How do you parse the relative importance of those two aspects?  And if I may be 
permitted, I am also curious to know how the Fed is going to conduct open market operations, if, 
as the New York Fed statement says, by the end of this year, they will e ssentially have no 
short -term securities to use.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, on the fiscal cliff, I mean, just the way that the 
programs are set up, the dollar amount associated with the tax e xpirations —tax -cut expirations, 
including the payroll tax cut and so on, is larger than the spending cuts, as I understand it .  But 
I’m not making any judgment about individual programs .  The point here is that putting all these 
things together, you have a very substantial withdrawal of income from the economy that will affect spending and will affect the ability of the economy to recover in the short  run.  Now, 
again , in making decisions about, you know, how to modify those automatic changes, Congress 
obviously has to look at the long  run, you know —what is the most effic ient tax structure, what ’s 
the best way to spend our limited resources?  Those are tough decisions that Congress has to make, but in terms of the fiscal cliff, in terms of what’ s going to happen in January, the —it’ s 
really the total of both spending cuts a nd tax increases which has the impact, which not only we, 
but others like the Congressional Budget Office , have identified as being a concern .  We’ ll still 
be able to do open market operations with our securities, even if the amount of short -term debt is 
very low .  And indeed, of course, over time, the —as securities come close to maturation, we will 
have other securities that are of short duration.

 DONNA BORAK.   Hi C hairman, Donna Borak with American Banker .  There have been 
a lot of questions raised as to whether the Volcker rule would have helped prohibit the trading 
loss of J .P. Morgan .  Given that regulators are in the middle of the rule -writing process and also 
examining what exactly went wrong, as a supervisor, do you think at this moment it ’s the right 
time to perhaps “ pump the brake s,” so to speak, and slow down the rule -writing process or has 
this recent episode really made it a stronger case for proceeding with the Volcker r ule 
expeditiously ?  And , secondly, if I may, since —given that you’ ve suggested that regulators 
might be late on the rule , surpassing the July 21st deadline, could you perhaps give us a target on 
when regulators are looking to release the rule?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the second question, it ’s a five -agen cy rule , I 
believe, and so a lot of coordination and cooperation is needed, and we had something like 
18,000 comment letters, so it’ s been a very difficult process in terms of the amount of work that 
has to be done, amount of coordination that has to be done, so I don’ t have a date for you .  I 
think if there ’s a silver lining to the events you referred to, it may  be that there’ s some things we 
can learn in terms of writing the rule and thinking about how it would work .  One aspect of our 
rule that I think w ould have been important in the context of the loss is that , in the rule, a bank 
would be required to provide a plan in advance explaining how the hedge was going to be done, how it was  going to work .  It would be necessary to have an auditing process to m ake sure that , 
in fact , that was being followed, that there were adequate risk management and governance rules 
to oversee the process , and it would be necessary that compensation for the executives involved 
in the management of the position would not be su ch that it would incentivize them to take 
proprietary positions .  So, one aspect of the rule that might have been relevant —and again, we 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
17 of 22 
 are still looking at that situation , as are the OCC and others —would have been the control, the 
governance aspects of it, and that might have potentially changed the outcome. 
MARK GREGORY.  Mark Gregory, BBC .  How much worse will the situation in 
Europe have to get before it starts seriously denting the prospects for recovery in the American 
economy, and thus really chang ing the direction of Fed ’s policymaking?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, we hope it doesn’ t get worse .  I think it ’s already one 
of the factors that has been a drag on U .S. recovery —not the only factor by any means, there are 
a number of others that I mentioned, but it has been having an effect, and it ’s been having an 
effect on the economies of other countries as well, countries that export to Europe .  So it is a 
significant issue .  We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that ’s 
neces sary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that —
in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there ’s a program for growth, and in 
which fiscal arrangements are clear —are made much clearer .  So there’ s a lot of work to be 
done .  Again, we think that the policymakers in Europe have very strong incentives to get this 
right, and we ’re very hopeful that they will get it right, and we are in close contact with them as 
they work on these issues .  But aga in, it is also important for us to be prepared for any further 
problems that might emerge from Europe , and we have been doing that .  For example, you know, 
we recently did our stress  tests of the large bank holding companies  to make sure they had 
enough ca pital even in the face of a severe financial crisis or a European crisis .  We have been 
monitoring the exposures of banks and other financial institutions to Europe and, of course , 
monitoring the situation there very closely .  So we are hoping for the best , we are hoping that 
European policymakers will take the additional steps they need to take to stabilize the situation .  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
18 of 22 
 But we are prepared , in case things get worse , to protect the U .S. economy and the U .S. financial 
system.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Greg Robb, MarketWatch .  I just want ed to 
get back to lending and credit .  The U .K. has started a program where the Bank of England is 
going to make lending to banks only if they lend to households and companies .  Is that 
something the Fed has under consideration?  Would that be something you’ d start  here?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We ll, we ’re very interested in it , and we ’re certainly going 
to follow it.  The details are not yet available.  A nd I think it should be noted that it ’s not just a  
Bank of  England program , but it ’s joint with the British T reasury .  So the question—one 
question might be , how much of a fiscal component is there?  Is there some kind of fiscal 
subsidy being included there?  
But we are looking for —as you know , throughout the crisis, we ’ve looked for new 
programs, new ways to help the economy .  And this will be a type of thing that will be on the list 
of programs that we look at. 
GREG IP.  Hi.  Greg Ip  of the Economist .  You have an inflation target of 2 percent , but 
your projections show inflation centered below 2 percent over the medium term .  I was 
wondering if you could explain why .  And secondly, you said that the Fed is prepared to do more 
if necessary .  Could you briefly comment on what sort of form additi onal action might take ?  
And, specifically, what are the relative costs and benefits of doing more QE versus more 
maturity extension?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the —in terms of the inflation forecasts, again , I think 
it should be said, as a preliminary poin t, that economic projections have a lot of uncertainty 
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
19 of 22 
 about them .  We talk about that uncertainty in the survey of e conomic projections .  So we 
shouldn’ t take a false sense of precision from those numbers.  
That being said, there is an issue about whether  or not there ’s sufficient stimulus in the 
economy .  As I mentioned earlier, one problem is that we are now at the zero bound, and that the 
types of unconventional programs that are available are—we know less about them , they have 
various costs and risks , and, for that reason, you may get a different amount of financial 
accommodation in this kind of regime than you would in one where short -term interest rates can 
be varied freely .  So I think that ’s really a critical issue.  
Now, in terms of t he costs, I would list , briefly , large asset purchases increase the size of 
our balance sheet  and therefore ultimately will make exit a more extended process .  Large asset 
purchases —which means that the Fed owns a larger share of a particular type of asset —may 
have im plications for market functioning , which in turn  might affect the ability of the Fed to 
have stimulative effects on the economy .  There are some financial stability issues that we are 
monitoring and that have to be taken into account .  So any kind of asses sment of appropriate 
policy must look both at the outlook for the economy and for —and at the cost s and risks 
associated with new measures, new steps that might be taken.  
That being said, again, I think at this point, we still do have considerable scope to do 
more , and we are prepared to do more .  We ’ll continue to monitor the economy and see how 
things evolve .  And if —again, we ’re looking primarily at the labor market in this respect—i f 
we’re not seeing a sustained improvement in the labor market, that would require additional 
action .   
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
20 of 22 
 In terms of balance sheet actions, we are unlikely to do more maturity extension for a 
while because we have taken that about as far as we can .  So we would have to take other types 
of steps in order to add to the amount of stimulus in the economy.  
TOSHIKI YAZAWA.  Thank you, Chairman .  I’m Toshiki Yazawa from Nikkei .  I hear a 
lot of conversations on liquidity trap in U .S.  That  was a familiar concept in Japan after a bubble 
burst in the l ost decades .  Is U .S. economy in liquidity trap?  A nd if that happens, how could 
economy escape from here?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, the U .S. economy is in a situation where short -term 
interest rates are close to zero .  And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add 
monetary accommodation by cutting short -term interest rates, the usual approach .  It’s been one 
of the themes of my own work for a long time , including  some of the work I did on the B ank of 
Japan , that central banks are not out of tools once the short -term interest rate hits zero .  There are 
additional steps that can be taken .  And we have demonstrated through both communications 
techniques —guidance about future policy , which is something the Japanes e have done as well , 
by the way—a nd through as set purchases, also something the Bank of Japan has done , that 
central banks do have some ability to provide financial accommodation to support their recovery 
even when short -term interest rates are close to zero .   
That being said, as I mentioned to Mr. I p, these nonstandard policies are less well 
understood, and they do have some cost s and risks .  But I do think that , at the same time , that 
they can be effective in helping the economy.  
JENNIFER LIBERTO.  Jennifer Liberto, CNNMoney .  Chairman, are you at all 
concerned that O peration T wist could affect banks ’ earnings and their willingness to lend?  Does 
it undercut your ability to increase credit to consumers?  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
21 of 22 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Credit to consumers?  No, I don’ t think so.  If—take, fo r 
example, I ’ve heard the argument that by lowering interest rates, you make it unattractive to 
lend.  I don ’t think that ’s quite right .  What we’ re lowering is the safe interest rate, the T reasury 
rate.  That should make it even more attractive for banks , rather than to hold securities , to look 
for borrowers and to earn the spread between the safe rate and what they can earn by lending to 
households and businesses .   
So I think that macropolicy and monetary policy can, i n fact , support lending .  Now, the 
question arises in some context s whether there are other barriers to lending as exist , for example, 
in some parts of the mortgage market .  But lower interest rates on securities and other types of 
assets, all else equal, would induce banks to look for highe r-yielding returns, higher -yielding 
assets in the form of loans to household and businesses.  
MER RILL GOOZNER.  Merril l Goozner, the Fiscal Times .  Returning to Europe , 
briefly —some analysts have said that should the situation deteriorate there , the Fed could step in 
by buying European sovereign debt  of various countries .  Are there any countries that you would 
rule out in such a strategy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   The Federal Reserve isn ’t going to be buying European 
sovereign debt, except we have a v ery limited amount of European sovereign debt as part of our 
foreign exchange reserves , and it comes primarily from a small number of countries .  So that ’s 
not something that we would be engaged in.  
CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  You ha ve two new Fed Governors aboa rd.  Did that 
change the tenor of the discussion at all this week ?  And did Jeremy Stein and Jay Powell push 
you in any particular policy direction?  
June 20, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
22 of 22 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, they are two terrific people with great experience.  
I’ve known Jeremy for a long  time .  He ’s an outstanding academic and knows a lot about 
finance.  Jay has both market experience and a lot of experience in government .  They both bring 
a lot to the table .  This was their first meeting , so I think, to some extent, they were in listenin g 
mode .  But they do have an awful lot to offer , and I really do look forward to working with them 
because I think that they are exceptional people .  And I ’m glad, f or the first time —I believe it ’s 
the case that this is the first time that we had seven  Governors at  an FOMC meeting since 2005.  
So it’s great to have a full complement of people , and it will help us do our other work as well as 
our monetary policy work more effectively.

1 of 25 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  
September 13, 2012  
  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Good afternoon.  Earlier t oday  the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) approved new measures to support  the recovery and employment  growth .  
I’ll get to the specifics of our actions in a few moments , but I’ll first describe the economic 
conditions  that motivated the Committee’s  decision to take additional action s.   
As you know, the Federal Reserve conducts  monetary policy under a dual mandate  from  
Congress  to promote maximum employment and price stability.  The United States has enjoyed 
broad price stability since the mid -1990s  and continues to do so today.  T he empl oyment 
situation , however, remains a grave concern.  While the economy appears to be on a path of 
moderate recovery, it isn’t  growing fast enough to make significant  progress reducing  the 
unemployment rate.  F ewer than half of the 8 million jobs lost in th e recession have been 
restored .  And, at  8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of 
the year and is well above normal levels.   
The weak job market should concern every American.  High unemployment imposes 
hardship on millions of people, and it entails  a tremendous  waste of human skills and talents .  
Five million Americans have been unemployed for more than six months, and millions more 
have left the labor force —many of them doubtl ess because they have given up on finding 
suitable work.  As the skills  of the long -term unemployed atrophy and as their connections to the 
labor market wither, they may find it increasingly difficult to get good jobs, to their and their families’  cost, of course, but also to the detriment of our nation’s  productive potential.  
To help bolster the recovery and promote price stability, the FOMC has provided 
unprecedented levels of policy accommodation in recent years.  With our main policy interest 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
2 of 25 rate near its effective lower bound, we have been using two complementary tools to carry out 
monetary policy —balance sheet actions and forward guidance regarding how long we anticipate 
maintaining ex ception al levels of policy accommodation.  While providing this support, we  have 
been prudent, carefully weighing the potential benefits and costs of each new policy action, and recognizing that monetary policy, particularly in the current circumstances, cannot cure all economic ills.   
The FOMC has taken several actio ns this year.  In January, it extended its forward 
guidance, stating that it anticipate d that  the federal funds rate will remain near current levels until 
late 2014.  In June, the Committee decided to continue through the end of the year the previously 
established program to extend the average maturity of the securities it holds by buying longer -
term securities and selling an equivalent amount of shorter -term securities.   However, incoming  
data confirm that the modest pace of growth continues to be inadequa te to generate much 
progress on unemployment.  W ith inflation anticipated to run at or below our 2 percent objective, 
the Committee has  become convinced that further policy accommodation is warranted to 
strengthen the recovery and support the gains we have begun to see in housing and other sectors.   
Accordingly , the FOMC  decided today on new actions , electing to expand its purchase s 
of securities and extend its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate.  Specifically, the 
Committee decided to purchas e additional  agency mortgage -backed securities , or MBS , at a pace 
of $40 billion per month.  The new MBS purchases —combined with the  existing  maturity 
extension program  and the continued reinvestment of principal payments f rom agency debt and 
agency MBS  already on our balance sheet —will result in an increase in our holdings of longer -
term securities of about $85 billion each  month for the remainder of the year .  The program of 
MBS purchases should increase the downward pressure on long -term interest rates more 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
3 of 25 generally, but also on mortgage rates , specifically, which should provide further support for the 
housing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing.   
The Committee also took two steps to  underscore its commitment to ongoing support for 
the recovery.   First, the Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and 
financial developments in c oming months , and if we do not see substantial  improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market , we will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional 
asset purchases, and employ our policy tools as appropriate until we do.  We will be looking for 
the sort of broad -based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained 
improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment.  Of course , in 
determining the size, pace, and composition of any additional asset purchases, we will, as always, take appropriate account of the inflation outlook and of their efficacy and costs.   
Additionally, the Committee  emphasized that it expects a highly accommodative stance 
of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  This should provide greater assurance to households and businesses  that policy 
accommodation will remain even as the economy picks up.  In particular, the Committee  today  
kept the target range f or the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and stated that it anticipates that  
exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid -
2015. 
In conjunction with today’s  meeting, FOMC participants —the 7 Board members and 
12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted their individual economic projections and policy 
assessments for the years 2012 through 2015 and over t he longer run.  Committee participants’  
projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of t his year have a central tendency 
of 8.0 to 8.2 percent, declining to 6.0 to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, levels that 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
4 of 25 remain  somewhat above participants’  estimates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.  
Participants’  projections of inflation have a central tendency of 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent for this 
year and 1.8 percent to 2.0 percent for 2015.  
While the economy appears to be advancing at a mode rate pace, with some 
improve ments appearing in housing  and elsewhere, FOMC participants see an economic outlook 
that remains uncertain.  The economy  continues to face economic headwinds, including the 
situation in Europe; tight credit for some borrowers; and fiscal contraction at the federal, state , 
and local levels.   In addition, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant 
downside risks. 
Before I take your questions , I’d like to briefly address three concerns that have  been  
raised about the Federal Reserve’s  accommodative monetary policy.  The first  is the notion that 
the Federal Reserve’s  securit ies purchases are akin to fiscal spending.  The second is that a 
policy of very low rates hurts savers.  The third is that the Federal Reserve’s  policies risk 
inflation down the road.  
On the first concern, I want to emphas ize that the Fed’s  purchases of longer -term 
securities are not comparable to government spending.  T he Federal Reserve buys financial 
assets, not goods and services.  Ultimately, the Federal Reserve will normalize its balance sheet 
by selling these financial assets back into the market or by allowing them to mature.  In the 
interim, the Federal Reserve’s  earnings fro m its holdings of securities are remitted to the 
Treasury.  In fact, the odds are strong that the Fed’s asset purchase programs , both through their 
net interest earnings and by strengthening the overall economy, will help reduce rather than increase the federal defic it and debt. 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
5 of 25 On the second concern, my colleagues and I  are very much aware that holders of interest -
bearing assets , such as certificates of deposit, are receiving very low returns.   But low interest 
rates also support the value of many other assets that Americans own, such as homes and 
businesses  large and small.  Indeed, in general, healthy investment returns  cannot be sustained in 
a weak economy , and , of course , it is difficult to save for retirement or other goals without the 
income from a job.  Thus, while low interest rates do impose some costs, Americans will ultimately benefit most from the healthy and growing economy that low interest rates help promote. 
And f inally, on inflation:  Inflation  has varied in recent years with swings in global foo d 
and fuel prices caused by a range of factors, such as drought and geopolitical tensions.  However, 
overall inflation has averaged very close to the Committee’s  goal of 2 percent  per year for quite a 
few years now, and a variety of measures show that longer -term inflation expectations are quite 
stable.  The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to  price stability as 
well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emergin g threat to price stability.  
Thank you.  I’d be happy to respond to your questions. 
DARREN GERSH.  H i, Mr. Chairman, it ’s Darren Gers h, Nightly Business Report .  Your 
forecast doesn ’t get back to full employment for four years, so could these new bond purchases 
go on for years?  And can you give us a better idea of when you ’ll—if you have specifics in 
mind on when you ’ll know it ’s time to stop?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Yes.  We ’ll be looking for signs that the economy is strong 
enough to prom ote improvement and sustained improvement in labor market conditions and 
declines in unemployment.  I mean, that ’s—we ’re not going to be able to sustain purchases until 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
6 of 25 we’re all the way back to full employment, that’ s not the objective .  The idea is to qu icken the 
recovery , to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs and reduce the 
unemployment rate .  So that ’s the criterion we ’re looking at.  
KRISTINA PETERSON.  Kristina Peterson of  Dow J ones.  The statement indicated that 
the highly acc ommodative stance would be maintained until after the recovery starts to 
strengthen , but there aren ’t any specific economic conditions that are described .  Could you 
describe what those would be ?  Or is the Fed —the Fed  seem s reluctant to have done that so far . 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, we ’ve been ta lking about our communications at the 
FOMC and trying to think about how best to communicate to the public , you know, what our 
policy reaction function, so to speak, is .  And we haven’ t, to this point , come to a set of n umbers, 
a set of data that we can put out .  But what we ’re trying to convey here is that we ’re not going to 
be premature in removing policy accommodation.  E ven after the economy starts to recover more 
quickly, even after the unemployment  rate begins to move down more decisively, we ’re not 
going to rush to begin to tighten policy .  We ’re going to give it some time to make sure the 
recovery is well established.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about that same line in the statement .  
Does that mean that your tolerance for inflation will be higher in coming years , in the middle of 
the recovery?  And , if not, what good is that language there if it doesn’ t tell people that the 
reaction function relative to inflation has changed?  Secondly, stock prices are up today, so are 
oil prices and gold.  Why aren ’t those part of the same reaction to the Fed ’s acts today?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , our policy approa ch doesn ’t involve intentionally 
trying to raise inflation .  That ’s not the objective .  The idea is to make su re we provide enough 
support so the economy will grow fast enough to bring unemployment down over time .  I mean, 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
7 of 25 as we look back at the last six m onths or so, we ’ve seen unemployment at basically the same 
place it was in January .  We’ve seen not enough jobs growth to bring down the unemployment 
rate, and what we need to see is more progress .  And that ’s what we will be looking at .  In terms 
of the m id-2015 date, we think by that point that the economy will be recovering, we’ll be 
providing the support it needs .  But if you look at our projections, you’ ll see it doesn ’t involve 
any inflation , that we still believe that inflation is going to be close to our 2 percent target.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  All right, I just need to follow  up.  Does this —so you ’re saying it 
does not include greater tolerance for inflation , that you will— you would reverse course if 
inflation were to  be above your target level, even given that statement?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, if inflation goes above the target level, as we talked 
about in our statement in January, we take a balanced approach .  We bring inflation back to the 
target over time , but w e do it in a way that takes into account the deviations of both of our 
objectives, you know, from their targets .   
ZACHARY GOLDFARB .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Earlier this year, on two 
occasions, the Fed took policy action s, which you defend ed as  extremel y important for the 
economy , but, as you mentioned, there hasn’ t been any improvement in the labor markets since 
the beginning of the year .  Why should people believe this  will make a difference?  And the 
projections seem to suggest it ’s approximately a 0. 4 reduction in unemployment .  Is that the limit 
of what Fed  policies can do going forward?   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , our assessment —I talked about this at my remarks at 
Jackson Hole —our assessment , and that of the research literature, is that the polic ies that we ’ve 
undertaken have had real benefits for the economy —that they have provided some support, that 
they have eased financial conditions and help reduce unemployment .  All tha t being said, 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
8 of 25 monetary policy, as I ’ve said many times, is not a panacea.  It’s not by itself able to solve these 
problems .  We ’re looking for policymakers in other areas to do their part .  We’ll do our part , and 
we’ll try to make sure that unemployment moves  in the right direction , but we can ’t solve this 
problem by ourselves.  
ZACHARY GOLDFARB .  And do you think that 0.4 percent difference in the 
projections  is about what ’s possible?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, what happens  is going to depend on where the 
economy goe s—how much ultimate accommodation we give the economy .  The 0.4 percent 
you’re referring to is the change in the forecast between the last projection and this one .  But 
remember, people make projections  assuming that policy is appropriate .  So some of them may 
have assumed these policies in their last projections , and not all are assuming these policies in 
this projection.  So tha t’s probably a little bit of an understatement of what we think we can get .  
But in any case, again, I want to be clear that while I think we can make a meaningful and 
significant contribu tion to this problem —to reducing this problem, we can’ t solve it.  We don’ t 
have tools that are strong enough to solve the unemployment problem.  
MIKE MCKEE .  You’ve made an el oquent explanation ove r the past  couple of weeks of 
the Fed ’s ability to lower in terest rates .  But what ’s missing for many economists is how the 
transmission mechanism is going to work .  Most people think this will have a minimal effect  on 
rates .  Can you give us an idea of how much you think it might push rates down, a nd why 
moving r ates down a few basis points might change demand, which seems to be the problem in 
the economy?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, the ultimate effect is going to depen d, of course , on 
how much we end up doing , and that , in turn, is going to depend on what the economy does .  
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
9 of 25 This is a conditional program ; we’re going to be providing accommodation according to how the 
economy evolves .  I think that ’s the virtue of putting it this way , is that if the economy is weaker, 
we’ll provide more support ; if the economy st rengthens on its own or other headwinds die  down, 
then it will require less support .  So the amount of support we provide is going to depend on how 
the economy evolves .  We do  think that these policies can  bring interest rates down—not just 
Treasury rates , but a whole range of rates, including mortgage rates and rates for corporate bonds 
and other types of important interest rates .  It also affects stock prices .  It affects other asset 
prices —home prices , for example.  So looking at all the different channe ls of effect, we think it 
does have impact on the economy .  It will have impact on the labor market , but, as again, the 
way I would describe it is a meaningful effect, a sign ificant effect , but not a panacea, not a 
solution for the whole issue .  We ’re just  trying to get the economy  moving in the right direction , 
to make sure that we don ’t stagnate at high levels of unemployment, that we ’re making progress 
toward s more acceptable l evels of unemployment.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, is this the 
limit of what the Fed could do?  You refer in your statement  to other policy tools .  If the 
unemployment situation doesn’ t improve , then what other measures  do you have available?  
Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, there ’s a var iety of possibilities , and we continue to 
look at all different options .  But the two primary types of tools , as I ’ve discussed , are balance 
sheet action s—and, of course, we can restructur e those, change those in various ways ; the other 
type of tool is communication tools .  And we could—we continue to work on how best to 
communicate with the public and how best to assure the public that the Fed will remain 
accommodative long enough to ensure recovery .  So, working with our communications tools, 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
10 of 25 clarifyin g our response to economic conditions, might be one way in which we could further 
provide accommodation. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters .  My question is —I want to go back 
to the tra nsmission mechanism because , speaking to people on the sideli nes of  the Jackson Hole 
conference, that seemed to be the concern about the remarks that you made is that they could 
clearly see the effect on rates and they could see the effect on the stock market , but they couldn’ t 
see how that had helped the economy .  So I think there ’s a fear that , over time, this has been a 
policy that ’s helping Wall Street but not doing that much for Main Street .  So could you 
describe, in some detail , how does it really different —differ from trickle -down economics , 
where you just pump money into the banks and hope that they lend?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well we are—this is a Main Street policy , because what 
we’re about here is trying to get jobs going .  We are trying to create more employment , we are 
trying to meet our maximum employment mandate, so that ’s the objective .  Our tools involve —I 
mean , the to ols we have involve affecting financial asset prices , and that ’s—those are the tools 
of monetary policy .  There are a number of different channels —mortgage rates, I mentioned 
other interest rates, corporate bond rates, but also the prices of various assets, like , for example, 
the prices of homes .  To the extent that home prices begin to rise, consumers will feel wealthier, 
they’ll feel more disposed to spend.  If house prices are ris ing, people may be more willing to 
buy homes because they think that they ’ll, you know, make a better return on that purchase .  So 
house prices is one vehicle .  Stock prices —many people own stocks directly or indirectly .  The 
issue here is whether or not i mproving asset prices generally will make people more willing to 
spend.  One of the main concerns that firms have is there is not enough demand, there ’s not 
enough people coming and demanding their products .  And if people feel that their financial 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
11 of 25 situation is better because their 401(k) looks better  or for whatever reason, their house is worth 
more, they are more willing to go out and spend, and that ’s going to provide the demand that 
firms need in order to be willing to hire and to invest. 
JON HILSENRATH.  Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, the 
statement says —we’ve come back to this a couple of times — “If the outlook for the labor market 
does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage -
backed securities, … additional asset purchases , and employ … other policy tools .”  Can you 
define and describe more specifically what “ improve substantially ” means?  And what do you—
what is the Committee referring to when it says “additional asset purchases ” and “ other … 
tools .”  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , again, we’ re looking for ongoing sustained 
improve ment in the labor market .  There’ s not a specific number we have in mind .  But what 
we’ve seen in the last six months isn ’t it.  We’re looking for something that involves 
unemployment coming down in a sustained way, not necessarily a rapid way , because I don ’t 
know if our tools are that strong, but we ’d like to see an economy which is strong enough that it 
will support improving labor market conditions and unemployment that ’s declining gradually 
over time .  That ’s essentially what we’ re looking for .  In terms of the tools that we have, we have 
the mortgage -backed security purchases , which we can continue or expand or change in any —
you know, in various  ways .  We could also purchase , of course , Treasuries ; we’ve retained that 
capacity .  And in terms of other policies , again, there are a number of possibilities , but the one I 
mentioned to Zach  in particular is our communication policies, finding ways to better explain our 
rate policies that will engender more -accommodative financial conditions.  
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
12 of 25 BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Mr. Cha irman , it seems pretty clear that the Fed ’s 
announcement today has created a good deal of confusion about how long you’ ll keep buying 
assets, judging from the questions in this room and outside of it .  Why did you choose not to 
adopt a  specific target?  Did th e Committee consider specific targets —there have been a number 
of proposals —and why did you choose not to do that?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, we —the problem is that, for this purpose , that what 
we’re looking for is a general improvement in labor market conditions .  We want to see the 
unemployment rate come down, but that ’s not the only indicator, obviously, of labor market 
conditions .  The u nemployment rate came down last month because participation fell .  That ’s not 
necessarily a sign of improvement .  So we want to see more jobs .  We want to see lower 
unemployment .  We want to see a stronger economy that can cause the improvement to be 
sustained ; it’s not just a one -month or two- month phenomenon.  We ’re not going to be looking 
for little wiggles in the numbers that are going to cause us to radically shift our policy .  So, we , 
at least at this point, have decided to define it qualitativel y.  I hope I am giving you at least a 
little color in terms of what w e’ll be looking for .  We’ll be looking for, again, an economy which 
is quickening, that gives signs of continued improvement, that allows labor markets to be 
stronger, and that will be the type of qualitative criteria that we look at .  We don’ t—again, we 
don’t have a single number that captures that , but we anticipate that we ’ll have to do more, and 
we’ll do enough to make sure that the economy gets on the right track.  
CRAIG TORRES .  Hi, Mr. Chairman .  Someone told me that less than 1 percent of all 
mortgages originated in the past 18 months went to borrowers with impaired credit history .  So 
when we talk about people and a  Main S treet policy, it seems like you ’re struggling , like many 
other central banks , and that ’s to get the low rate s down to—the challenge is to get them to 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
13 of 25 people who really need them, people who are paying high rates or companies with somewhat 
fragile balance sheets .  So, given that ’s the case— I mean , you guys got involved in markets 
when they were dysfunctional in the crisis .  What ’s your appetite for doing more -targeted credit 
programs if , post -election , you had a Treasury S ecretary and a C ongress that was willing to 
underwrite some of the credit risk ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, now you’ re talking about congressional programs , 
and I don’ t, you know, I don’ t advocate specific programs .  It’s up to them to make those 
decisions .  I think we ’re seeing modest improvement in mortgage markets .  One thing that ’s 
helping is a stronger housing market .  One reason that lenders have been very constrained is they 
are worried about further house price declines that will make the collateral worth less than the loan.  As house prices have begun to rise, as the economy has gotten a little stronger , lending 
standards have eased just a bit .  There’ s also been other changes which are useful .  I note , for 
example, that the FHFA and the GSEs have recently changed their policy on putbacks  so that 
banks will have more certainty abo ut under what conditions  a mortgage will be put back to them 
if it defaults .  So I think there ’s number of things in train that will make the mortgage markets a 
little bit more open, and that is one factor , actually , that could make our policy more effecti ve 
rather than less effective over time—if more people have access to mortgage credit, more people can take advantage of the low rates that we ’re providing.  
GREG IP .  Greg Ip of the Economist .  Mr. Chairman, one of the innovations of your 
statement today is that you have for the first time explicitly predicated your monetary policy action on the achievement of explicit economic goals , in this case a substantial improvement in 
the labor market .  Could you give us some explanation of how that conditioning wil l make your 
policy more effective than if you had simply done as you previously have :  announced the policy 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
14 of 25 and then conducted it?  And a technical question:   When “ Operation T wist” ends , do you 
anticipate adjusting the size of your asset purchases in orde r to maintain the $85 billion monthly 
flow of long- term asset purchases?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  On the latter , when Operation T wist ends, we will be 
looking at the whole set of asset pur chases in order to make decisions .  We ’ll be looking at the 
state of the economy , as we described in the statement .  In particular , what ’s the state of the labor 
market, what ’s the state of the outlook for economic growth?   On conditioning , our policies have 
always been conditional in that we ’ve always been clear that our asset  purchase s, for example, 
were reviewed periodically to see if they were still necessary, if they needed to be expanded .  We 
did extend the maturity extension program , for example, when we thought that more support was 
needed for the economy , so our policie s have always had a significant element of conditionality .  
But the idea here is to make that more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more 
obvious that the Fed will do what ’s needed to provide the support for the economy .  And we 
hope that w hat that will do is provide a bit more assurance, maybe a bit more confidence , that the 
Fed will be there to do what it can .  Again, we ’re not promising, you know, a cure to all these 
ills.  But what we can do is provide some support , and by assuring the public that we will be 
prepared to take action if the economy falters, we ’re hopeful that that will increase confidence 
and make people more willing to invest, hire , and spend. 
PETER BARNES .  Sir , just to follow  up on—Peter Barnes with Fox Business —to follow 
up on Darren’ s questions, a question about getting back to full employment .  It looks like there ’s 
a lot more work to do here .  And so I want ed to ask you about your plans as Fed C hairman —
your term expires in January of 2014.  Governor Romney ’s comm ents notwithstanding , what are 
your plans?  Do you plan to leave at that time ?  W ould you consider an appointment to a third 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
15 of 25 term at the Fed at all?  And then, if I may , on election year politics, is there any —do you have 
any concern or was there any discu ssion within the C ommittee about whether or not your actions 
today might be perceived as helping President Obama, helping the economy , and thus helping 
President Obama get reelected and hurting Governor Romney ’s chances in the presidential 
contest?  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , on the former , I’m—I have a lot to do.  I am very 
focused on my work, and I don ’t have any decision or any information to give you on my 
personal plans .  On the politics, we have tried very, v ery hard —and I think we ’ve been 
successful —at the Federal Reserve to be nonpartisan and apolitical .  We make our decisions 
based entirely on the state of the economy and the needs of the economy for policy 
accommodation .  So we just don’ t take those factors into account , and we think that ’s the best 
way to maintain our independence and maintain the trust of the public.  
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman , Donna Borak with American Banker .  My question 
pertains to Basel  III.  Community bankers , as you know , have been very worried about the 
impact that t hese rules will have on their banks , especially given the fact that there’ s been some 
industry consolidation, and some have  even questioned  whether or not the Fed has actually 
looked at  the impact that the rules would have on smaller -sized institutions .  So my question for 
you is , will there be relief for the smaller institutions , and can you provide any assurance that this 
will not be a one -size-fits-all regulation ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Certainly .  We are very interested in and very focused on 
community banks  at the Fed .  We believe they play a very important role in our economy  and in 
our communities .  We have a number of ways of communicating with community banks .  It 
includes our advisory council made up of comm unity bankers .  It includes a special set  of 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
16 of 25 programs we have to reach out and talk to community bankers .  So we are very interested in their 
views .  I speak regularly to conventions and the like and talk to various groups .  In terms of 
Basel  III, of course , it’s not one -size-fits-all.  Many —and, indeed , many of the most difficult, 
complex regulations apply only to the largest and most complex institutions —for example, the 
capital surcharge that the largest  banks have to hold, t he complex rule s applying to trading books  
and derivatives, the extra supervision under section 165, the orderly  liquidation authority, the 
liquidity rules —the whole range of things that apply only to the largest , most complex , and 
internationally active banks .  For the smaller banks , what our propose d rule does is try to  
strength en their capital, and many small banks will already meet those capital requirements .  
Smalls banks tend to be very well capitalized .  But , of course , it’s important for small banks to 
be well capitalized as well as large banks .  And there’ s a leve rage requirement .  But , again , most 
of the rules, most of the —particularly the most complex rules in Basel  III will not apply to the 
smaller banks .  Indeed, banks under $500 million have special exemptions from these rules .  
Having said all of that , I remind you that what we have now is a proposed rule , and we ’re 
receiving comment on that .  We have a subcommittee of our supervision committee with two  
experienced —one community banker, one community bank supervisor  on it from our B oard who 
are particularly i nterested in making sure that the rules are not excessively onerous , and we will 
be looking at the comments and trying to make sure that we take into account the needs of 
community banks when we put out the final rule.  
GREG ROBB .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Yest erday former Fed Governor Larry Meyer 
at a conference in Washington said he ’d never seen such a divided Fed.  And we see it, we who 
cover the Fed see it in the speeches , in the run -up to today ’s decision .  Some people said that it 
was dubious whether Q E3 would work.  Could you comment on former Governor Meyer ’s 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
17 of 25 suggestions , and then —and sometimes don ’t you think, don’ t you wish that some of the Fed 
officials who don’ t support QE would keep their —keep their fears to themselves ?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNA NKE .  Well , as you know , we are living in a very complex time 
and dealing with a complex economic situation and a variety of novel and different issues , 
including new policies that haven’ t been used in the same way in the  past, and so naturally we 
have a r ange  of views, a range of opinions .  I think on the whole that ’s probably a good thing .  
It’s good to hear different points of view , and it ’s good to make sure that the points of view that 
are outside the Fed are reflected in the discussion around the tabl e inside the Fed .  So we have a 
very collaborative and collegial discussion process , that , again —that spans a range of views .  We 
were, however , able to come to a pretty good consensus —as you know , the vote on this was 11 
to 1—and that ’s a sign that the broad center of the Committee does support these actions and will 
continue to support them going forward.  
GREG ROBB .  Does the negative commentary hurt QE ?  Could it , if people in the 
market don’ t think it will work?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  There ’s going to be negative commentary whether it comes 
from Fed officials or not .  Again, because there’ s a range of views —some people think it ’s more 
effective than others .  I discussed some of the evidence in my speech in Jackson Hole , and I 
talked abo ut the fact that, you know, different researchers have gotten different estimates of the 
impact .  Virtually all of them find that there is some beneficial impact, but they disagree on how 
much .  So, there ’s going to be disagreement .  And again, I personall y don ’t think that it’ s a 
panacea, I personally don ’t think it’ s going to solve the problem .  But I do think it has enough 
force to help nudge the economy in the right direction. 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
18 of 25 MICHELLE FLEURY .  You said that you can’ t cure all ills, that you haven ’t got strong 
enough tools to deal with the unemployment problem .  I was curious to know what policy 
actions you ’d like to see outside the Fed to try and address this .  And, secondly, also on the 
“fiscal cliff, ” the expected spending cuts and tax increases, how concerned are you about that?  
And what ammunition do you have to deal with that, if that becomes a problem?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well there ’s, again, a range of areas where actions could be 
taken, and I can ’t really prescribe all those possible responses .  I would focus, I think, on the 
fiscal side .  We cur rently have the so -called fiscal cliff .  If no action is taken, there ’s going to be 
a very substantial increase in taxes and cut in spending on January 1 of the coming year .  The 
CBO has suggeste d that  if that’s allowed to take place, that it would cause unemployment to 
begin to rise , and it might throw the economy back into recession.  So I think one very basic 
thing that could be done to help address the recovery —the weakness of the recovery and the 
need  for more employment —would be to address the fiscal clif f while simultaneously addressing 
longer -term fiscal sustainability issues which remain, of course, very serious .  So that ’s one area 
where there is a lot of potential benefit .  If the fiscal cliff is n’t addressed, as I ’ve said, I don ’t 
think our tools are strong enough to offset the effects of a major fiscal shock, so we ’d have to 
think about what to do in that contingency .  So I think it ’s really important for the fiscal 
policymakers to, you know, work together and try to find a solution for that. 
PATRICK WELTER .  Mr . Chairman, my name is Patrick Welter  with the German 
newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  I have two questions , if I may.  One is in the 
projections .  In the economic and inflation projections , you foresee a low inflation r ate below 
2 percent to 2015—not  you personally , but the FOMC .  I am wondering , if you look at the 
growth rate s, you have growth rates of about 3.4 perc entage points in 2014 and 2015.  How long 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
19 of 25 do you think that it might work that you have such strong growth and no inflation pressur e?  And 
the second question, if I may , is, a lot of economist s don’ t see too much effect out of the further 
round of QE3.  Aren ’t you worried that , in promising that you will do whatever you can, even if 
it is tiny,  small, that you give some kind of carte blanche to the fiscal policy and to the C ongress 
not to do enough on their side of the policy action?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, the—on inflation, we do anticipate at some point 
what ’s normal in a recovery, which is , given that the economy fell very quickly and there ’s a lo t 
of unused capacity, there ’s a lot of slack in the economy, it would be normal that there would be 
a peri od where the economy would grow faster than trend in order to make up some of the slack 
that was created .  So we don’ t anticipate the economy is going to be overheating anytime soon .  
And as long as we pay close attention to inflation expectations as well as the trajectory of the 
economy, we think inflation will remain close to our 2 percent target .  On your second question, 
certainly , there is a range of views  on how effective these tools are .  I’ve spent  a lot of time , as 
all of my colleagues have , looking at the evidence,  and, of course , the staff here have done a 
great deal of work on the question.  And the bottom line for most of it, most of the research, is that while these  tools are not so powerful that they can solve the problem, they are at least able to 
provide meaningful support to the economy .  Our job is to use the tools we have to meet our 
mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability .  So if we have tools  that we think 
can provide some assistance and we’ re not meeting our mandate , then I think that our obligation 
is to do what we can .  Of course , we would like to see policies across the board to help address 
these issues .  But, you know, that ’s not our province;  we are the monetary policy authorit ies, and 
our job is to use monetary policy as effectively  as we can.  
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
20 of 25 STEVE BECKNER .  Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.  There have been concerns 
raised , questions raised by people like Columbia Professor Michael Woodford and others about 
the credibility of your forward guidance on the path, the future path of the federal funds rate —
the idea being that , to the extent it’ s conditional, it ’s not really convincing and doesn’ t provide 
the kind of confidence that you re ferred to .  Now, on this latest statement, you’ve removed some 
of that conditionality .  I am particularly struck by the statement that “ the C ommittee expects that 
a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable 
time after the economic recovery strengthens .”  I assume that was done to make your forward 
guidance more credible, and yet the question remains whether, you know, as the economy picks 
up steam, whether the FOMC will really follow through and keep rates lo w or whether you will 
do as the Fed has always done and begin to raise the funds rate.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, that’ s an important question.  Michael Woodford— 
who, by the way, is my former colleague and coauthor and friend, so I know him quite well , and  
I know his works quite well —I think, actually, the thrust of his research is that forward 
guidance—communication about future policy —is, in fact , the most powerful tool that central 
banks have when the interest rate is close to zero .  And he advocates pol icies like nominal GDP 
targeting , for example, that would essentially require credibility lasting many years , the 
implication being that the Fed would target the nominal level of GDP  and promise to do that for 
many years in the future even if inflation, you know, rose as part of that policy .  So his own 
perspective is that credibility is the key tool that central banks have in order to get traction at the zero lower bound.  Whether we have the credibility to persuade markets that we’ ll follow 
through is an empirical question .  And the evidence , which I also , again , discussed in my 
remarks recently , is that when we ’ve announced extended guidance , that financial markets have 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
21 of 25 responded to that, that private -sector forecasters have changed their estimates of what 
unemployment and inflation will be when the Fed begins to remove accommodation.  So the 
empirical evidence is that our announcements do have considerable credibility .  And I think 
there’ s a good reason for that, which is that we have talked a lot both publicly and privately 
about the rationale for maintaining rates low even as the economy strengthens, and I think the basic ideas are broadly espoused within the Committee .  And so there is a consensus that even as 
the personnel change and so  on going forw ard, that this is the appropriate approach, and that by 
following through, we will have created a reserve of credibility that we can use in any subsequent episodes that occur.  
DON LEE .  Don  Lee with the L.A. Times .  With mortgage rates already at historica l 
lows, how much further do you think the actions, your actions , will drive down the rates , and 
related to that, I ’m assuming that you expect the purchase s of mortgage -back ed securities to have 
a meaningful effect on refinancings and housing activity .  Wha t would that look like?  What 
would that meaningful effect mean?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, again , as I mentioned before , it’s true that our 
mortgage -back ed securities purchases ought to drive down mortgage rates, and put downward 
pressure on mortgage rates , and create more demand for homes and more refinancing .  But it will 
depend, again , ultimately on several things .  One will be on the amount that we do, the amount of 
purchases  that we do, and that in turn is going to be a function of how the economy evol ves.  If 
the economy is weaker, we’ ll do more, and in those case s, probably rates would be pretty low at 
any case because the economy is looking weak .  If the economy is stronger, strong enough to 
create improving labor market conditions , we won’t have to do as much .  And so, the amount 
that we do depends on how the economy evolves .  So, since I don ’t know exactly how much 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
22 of 25 we’ll end up doing , it’s a little bit hard to give you an exact estimate .  So I think that’s , you 
know, in terms of how many homes and t hose kinds of questions , again , I think that the markets 
are looking —are l ooking a little better .  I think that house prices are beginning to rise in some 
markets, which will encourag e people to look at homes , will encourage lenders to make more 
mortgage l oans.  So I ’m hopeful that we ’ll see continued progress in the housing market ; that—
that has been one of the missing pistons in the engine here .  Housing is usually a big part of the  
recovery process .  We haven ’t had that nearly to the usual extent, and to the extent that we can 
support housing, I think that would be a very useful outcome. 
DON LEE .  There doesn’t  seem  to be  that many people who could qualify for 
refinancings.  C an we expect a meaningful effect on an increase in refinancing activity?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I think there ’ll be some, but you get more benefit 
when people buy homes .  And sales of homes are down still, but they have been rising steadily, 
and we ’re trying to provide more support for people who want to go out and buy homes , 
construct  homes, and also those who want to refinance .  But it’ s the purchase s of new homes that 
generate the construction activity , the furnishing , all those things that help the economy grow .   
SCOTT SPOERRY .  Scott Spoerry with CNN an d CNNMoney .  Earlier this year at  one 
of your  news conferences in this room , you said that you were already hearing anecdotal 
information from some of your colleagues at the r egional  Fed Banks about firms, companies 
making decisions on hiring next year b ecause they were af raid of the fiscal c liff or whatever the 
federal government was going to do in terms  of—in terms of cutbacks .  It’s been a few months 
since you made that statement , and I’m sure your staff are working hard on it , but how much of a 
headwind to the economy is the fear of the federal government just s ort of cutting way back , 
falling  across  the fiscal cliff or even —even if they take a few steps back from the cliff , it’s still 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
23 of 25 there.  How much is that fear contributing t o lack  of—lack of growth or adequate GDP growth in 
the economy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well  I—you know, it’s pretty hard to give you a number, 
but I can certainly confirm that as the R eserve Bank presidents and G overnors made their reports 
today and yesterday  around the table, there was considerable discussion of uncertainty , including 
policy uncertainty, fiscal policy uncertainty, and the implications of that for hiring and 
investment decisions .  A lot of —a lot of firms are waiting to see whether that problem will be 
resolved .  And if so, how?  And I think it is a concern .  It is something that is affecting behavior 
now.  But again, I don’ t know —I don’ t have a number , I don’ t know how big that effect is , but, 
certainly , the sooner that can be resolved, the sooner it can be clarified , it will be beneficial not 
just because we avoid the cliff itself , but because we clarify for firms, for employers and 
investors , how that ’s going to be resolved.  So, I think it ’s an issue that is of some consequence, 
yes. 
CATHE RINE HOLLANDER .  Hi, Mr. Chairman.   Catherine Hollander , National 
Journal .  How much was the fiscal cliff a decision , or a factor in your decision, to do an open-
ended  QE instead of a fixed sum ?  Or fiscal uncertainty more generally?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  We ll, we take the economy as we find it .  There are a lot of 
headwinds right now that are affecting the economy .  There ’s fiscal headwinds .  There’ s 
international factors , including the situation in Europe .  There’ s factors arising from still-
impaired credit  markets , and so on.  So we looked at that —looked at the economy from the 
perspective of, you know, how quickly it ’s been growing over the last six months to a year .  And, 
as I talked about in a speech in March , in order for employment gains to be sustaine d, for 
unemployment to fall, the economy needs to grow at or above trend levels.  And lately it’ s not 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
24 of 25 really been at trend .  So we ’ve been responding to that problem and trying to take steps that will 
assure somewhat stronger growth and, we hope , will help  bring unemployment down over time .  
Now, again, the fiscal cliff, the uncertainty about  the fiscal cliff , is one of the factors , one of the 
headwinds , but I ’m sure there are many others , and we don’ t try to differentiate among them in 
any sense.  If the f iscal cliff does occur, I suspect it won’ t, and I hope it won’ t, but if it does, and 
we get the kind of impact the Congressional B udget O ffice is talking about, as I ’ve said, I don’ t 
think the Federal R eserve has the tools to offset that , and we would have  to rethink at that point .  
But we ’ve taken the steps we’ ve taken now because we’ d like to see the economy gather more 
momentum , and the more momentum it has, the better placed we are to deal with any shocks that 
might come down the road. 
MARCY GORDON.  Marcy Gordon with the Associated Press .  One of the aspects 
we’ve seen in recent reports on unemployment is the shrinking labor force .  Is that something 
that’s of specific concern to you, and what does it tell us about the labor market and the 
economy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , you are absolutely  right .  And as I mentioned earlier, 
the unempl oyment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in 
participation .  Some decline in participation is anticipated , is as expected .  We’re an aging 
society.  We have more people retiring .  Female participation has flattened out ; it hasn ’t 
continued to climb as it did for several decades .  We’re seeing less participation among younger 
people, fewer college students taking part -time jobs and the  like.  So part of this decline in 
participation was something that we anticipated quite a long time ago, but part of it is cyclical.  
Part of it reflects the fact that some people —because they have essentially given up or at least 
are very discouraged —hav e decided to leave the labor force.  And the anticipation is that if the 
September 13, 2012    Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL 
25 of 25 economy really were to strengthen, and labor markets were to strengthen , at least some of those 
people would come back into  the labor force .  They might even temporarily raise the 
unemployment rate because they ’re now looking again.  So the participation rate over and 
above —the decline in participation rate over and above the downward trend is just one of the 
other indicators of a general ly weak labor market .  And it’s why I said ea rlier that we do want to 
look at a range of indicators, not just the unemployment rate , although that ’s a very important 
indicator , not just payrolls , although that also is a leading indicator , but participation, hours, part -
time work , and a variety of other measures which suggest that our labor market is still in quite 
weak condition.  
Thank you.

 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference 
December 12, 2012  
 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon.  
It’s been about three and a half years since the economic recovery began.  The economy 
continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Unfortunately, however, unemployment remains high.  
About 5 million people —more than 40 percent of the unemployed—have been with out a job for 
six months or more, and millions more who say they would like full -time work have been able to 
find only part -time employment or have stopped looking entirely.  The conditions now prevailing 
in the job market represent an enormous waste of human and economic potential.  A return to broad- based prosperity will require sustained improvement in the job market, which in turn 
requires stronger economic growth.  Meanwhile, apart from some temporary fluctuations that 
largely reflected swings in energ y prices, inflation has remained tame and appears  likely to run at 
or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC ’s) 2 percent objective in coming 
quarters and over the longer term.  
Against a macroeconomic backdrop that includes both high unemployment and subdued 
inflation, the FOMC will maintain its highly accommodative policy.  Today the Committee took several steps.  First, it decided to continue its purchases of agency mortgage -backed securities 
(MBS), initiated at the September meeting, at a pace o f $40 billion per month.  Second, the 
Committee decided to purchase longer -term Treasury securities, initially at a pace of $45 billion 
per month, after its current program to extend the average maturity of its holdings is completed at the end of the year.   In continuing its asset purchases, the Committee seeks to maintain 
downward pressure on longer -term interest rates and to keep financial conditions 
accommodative, thereby promoting hiring and economic growth while ensuring that inflation

 over time is clo se to our 2 percent objective.  Finally, the Committee today also modified its 
guidance about future rate policy to provide more information to the public about how it 
anticipates it will react to evolving economic conditions.  I will return to this change  in our 
communication after discussing our decision to continue asset purchases.  
Although the Committee’s announcement today specified the initial monthly pace and 
composition of asset purchases, it did not give specific dates at which the program may be modified or ended.  Instead, the pattern of future asset purchases will depend on the Committee’s 
evaluation of incoming information, in two respects. 
First, we expect to continue asset purchases until we see a substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the  labor market, in a context of price stability.  In assessing the extent of progress, 
the Committee will be evaluating a range of labor market indicators, including the 
unemployment rate, payroll employment, hours worked, and labor force participation, among others.  Because increases in demand and production are normally precursors to improvements in labor market conditions, we will also be looking carefully at the pace of economic activity more broadly.   
Second, the Committee will be monitoring economic and financial developments to 
assess both the efficacy and possible drawbacks of its asset purchase program.  The Federal Reserve’s asset purchases over the past few years have provided important support to the economy, for example, by helping to keep mort gage rates historically low.  The Committee 
expects this policy tool to continue to be effective and the costs and risks to remain manageable, but as the program continues, we will be regularly updating those assessments.  If future evidence suggests that the program’s effectiveness has declined, or if potential unintended side effects or risks become apparent as the balance sheet grows, we will modify the program as 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
3 of 34 
 appropriate.  More generally, the Committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of 
securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived 
benefits and costs of the program.  
Unlike the explicitly quantitative criteria associated with the Committee’s forward 
guidance about the federal funds rate, which I  will discuss in a moment, the criteria the 
Committee will use to make decisions about the pace and extent of its asset purchase program are qualitative; in particular, continuation of asset purchases is tied to our seeing substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  Because we expect to learn more over time 
about the efficacy and potential costs of asset purchases  in the current economic context , we 
believe that qualitative guidance is more appropriate at this time.   
In today’s statement, the Committee also recast its forward guidance to clarify how it 
expects its target for the federal funds rate to depend on future economic developments.  Specifically, the Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal, a nd longer -term inflation 
expectations continue to be well anchored.”   This formulation is a change from earlier statements 
in which forward guidance about the federal funds rate was expressed in terms of a date; for example, in the statements following its  September and October meetings,  the Committee 
indicated that it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted “ at least through mid -2015.”  The  modified  formulation  makes more explicit  the 
FOMC’s intention  to maintain accommodation as  long as  needed to promote a stronger 
economic recovery in the context of price stability, a strategy that we believe will help support 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
4 of 34 
 household and business confidence and spending.  By tying future monetary policy more 
expli citly to economic conditions, this formulation of our policy guidance should also make 
monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public. 
The change in the form of the Committee’s forward guidance does not in itself imply any 
change in the Com mittee’s expectations about the likely future path of the federal funds rate 
since the October meeting.  In particular, the Committee expects that the stated threshold for unemployment will not be reached before mid- 2015 and projects that inflation will re main close 
to 2 percent over that period.  Thus, given the Committee’s current outlook, the guidance introduced today is consistent with the Committee’s earlier statements that “exceptionally low 
levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted  at least through mid -2015.”    
Let me emphasize that the 6 ½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate should not be 
interpreted as the Committee’s longer -term objective for unemployment.  Indeed, in the 
economic projections submitted in conjunction with today’s meeting, the central tendency of participants’ est imates of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  
However, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with a lag, the Committee believes that it likely will need to begin moving away from a highly accommodative policy stance before the economy reaches maximum employment.  Waiting until maximum employment is achieved before beginning the process of removing policy accommodation could lead to an undesirable overshooting of potential output and compromise the FOMC’s longer -term 
inflation objective of 2 percent.  As the FOMC statement makes clear, the Committee anticipates that policy under the new guidance will be fully consistent with continued progress against unemployment and with inflation remaining close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the longer term.  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
5 of 34 
 Although the modified guidance should provide greater clarity about how the Committee 
expects to respond to incoming data, it by no means puts monetary policy on autopilot.  In this 
regard, let me make several  points. 
First, as the statement notes, the Committee views its current low -rate policy as likely to 
be appropriate at least  until the specified thresholds are met.  Reaching one of those thresholds, 
however, will not automatically trigger immediate reduction in policy accommodation.  For example, if unemployment were to decline to slightly below 6½ percent at a time when inflation and inflation expectations were subdued and were projected to remain so, the Committee might judge an immediate increase in its  target for the federal funds rate to be inappropriate.  
Ultimately , in deciding when and how quickly to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee 
will follow a balanced approach in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer -run 
2 percent  goal and deviations of employment from its estimated maximum level.    
Second, the Committee recognizes that no single indicator provides a complete 
assessment of the state of the labor market and therefore will consider changes in the unemployment rate within the broader context of labor market conditions.  For example, in evaluating a given decline in the unemployment rate, the Committee will also take into account the extent to which that decline was associated with increases in employment and hours worked, as opposed to, say, increases in the number of discouraged workers and falling labor force participation.  The Committee will also consider whether the improvement in the unemployment rate appears sustainable.  
Third, the Committee chose to express the inflation threshold in terms of projected 
inflation between one and two years ahead, rather than in terms of current inflation.  The Committee took this approach to make clear that it intends to look through purely transitory 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
6 of 34 
 fluctuations in inflation, suc h as those induced by short -term variations in the prices of 
internationally traded commodities, and to focus instead on the underlying inflation trend.  In 
making its collective judgment about the underlying inflation trend, the Committee will consider a variety of indicators, including measures such as median, trimmed mean, and core inflation; the views of outside forecasters; and the predictions of econometric and statistical models of inflation.  Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.  
Finally, the Committee will continue to monitor a wide range of information on economic 
and financial developments to ensure that policy is conducted in a manner consistent w ith our 
dual mandate.   
It’s worth noting that the goals of the FOMC’s asset purchases and of its federal funds 
rate guidance are somewhat different.  The goal of the asset purchase program is to increase the near-term momentum of the economy by fostering more -accommodative financial conditions, 
while the purpose of the rate guidance is to provide information about the future circumstances under which the Committee would contemplate reducing accommodation.  I would emphasize that a decision by the Committee  to end asset purchases, whenever that point is reached, would 
not be a turn to tighter policy.  While in that circumstance the Committee would no longer be increasing policy accommodation, its policy stance would remain highly supportive of growth.  Only at some later point would the Committee begin actually removing accommodation through rate increases.  Moreover, as I have discussed today, the decisions to modify the asset purchase program and to undertake rate increases are tied to different criteria.  
In conclusion, the FOMC’s actions today are part of our ongoing efforts to support 
economic recovery and job creation while maintaining price stability.  As I have often stressed, 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
7 of 34 
 however, monetary policy has its limits; only the private and public sectors working together can 
get the U.S. economy fully back on track.  In particular, it will be critical that fiscal policymakers come together soon to achieve longer -term fiscal sustainability without adopting policies that 
could derail the ongoing recovery.  
Thank you.  I would be happy to answer your questions.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman from CNBC.  I guess I have a lot of 
questions but I’ll just offer up two here.  Why are there different targets for QE and for the funds rate?  What does that achieve?  Secondly, what good is a target if you have to make reference to calendar dates in the statement itself, which is the thing you got away from.  You had to point out in the statement that it’s not substantially different from the calendar dates we  set back in 
October.  Do you have to keep doing that from now on to make it clear that —and then just 
thirdly, I guess I know I said two— 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m going to forget.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  But then you have another paragraph after that that says it ’s not just 
target it’s something else.  So, it’s unclear to me what good these targets are if you have to reference a calendar date, and then you kind of say in the next paragraph it’s not really targets.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, so first, the —as I said —the asset purchases and the 
rate increases have different objectives.  The asset purchases are about creating some near -term 
momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate t arget, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing 
accommodation.  Two very different objectives.  Secondly, the asset purchases are a less well-understood tool.  We have —we’ll be learning over time about how efficacious they are, 
about what costs they may carry with them in terms of unintended consequences that they might 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
8 of 34 
 create, and we’ll be seeing how —what else happens in the economy that can affect, you know, 
the level of unemployment, for example, that we hope to achieve.  And so, for that reason, a s I 
discussed in my opening remarks, we decided to make the criteria for asset purchases qualitative 
at this time because we have a number of different things that we need to look at as we go forward.  Rate increases, by contrast, are well understood, and we understand the relationship between those rate increases and the state of the economy.  And so we’ve been able to give somewhat more quantitative, more specific guidance in that respect.  With respect to the date, in the transition today, we wanted to m ake clear that the change in guidance did not —it happens to 
be the case that it doesn’t change our mid -2015 expectation.  Going forward, we’ll drop the date 
and rely on the conditionality, and that has, I think, a very important advantage which is that if news comes in that the economy is stronger or weaker, then financial markets and the public will 
be able to adjust their expectations for when policy tightening will occur without the Committee having to go through a process of changing its date in a nontr ansparent way, so I think that’s 
beneficial.  Does that cover your —okay.  
MARCY GORDON.  Mr. Chairman, what prompted the Committee to make the decision 
at this particular time to specify targets?  And, by taking an unemployment rate that is quite low compar ed to currently, does that shift the balance of priorities in terms of your dual mandate, 
closer more in the direction of reducing unemployment rather than inflationary pressures?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s a very good question.  We took the change today 
after a good bit of discussion.  We had a very substantial discussion of the threshold approach at 
our last meeting.  And we felt it was ready to go, ready to put out.  We —while there are different 
views on aspects of the threshold approach, there was a lot  of agreement that having a more 
explicit connection between rate policy and the state of the economy was more transparent and 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
9 of 34 
 more helpful to the markets and to the public than our date -based guidance, and therefore, there 
was a general view that, at some point at least, that we should switch to that kind of guidance.  
So we do hope that it’ll be more helpful and give markets more information about how we’re going to respond going forward.  It is not a change in our relative balance, weights, towards inflation and unemployment —by no means.  First of all, with respect to inflation, we remain 
completely committed to our 2 percent longer -run objective.  Moreover, we expect our forecast, 
as you can see from the Summary of Economic Projections; our forecasts are  that inflation will 
actually remain, despite this threshold of 2½, that inflation will actually remain at or below 2 percent going forward.  And so—and finally, the thresholds that we have put out are entirely 
consistent with our long -standing views on what the rate path has to be, what the path of interest 
rates has to be, in order to achieve improvement in the labor market while keeping inflation close 
to target.  So we —I think both sides of the mandate are well -served here.  There is no real 
change in  policy.  What it is instead is an attempt to clarify the relationship between policy and 
economic conditions. 
MARCY GORDON.  Could I ask, also, given that the —your economic projections are all 
the more important now that you’ve specified these targets , is it difficult to put forward these 
projections now given the uncertainty over the fiscal cliff?  How sort of plastic are these?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are you talking about the SEP projections?  
MARCY GORDON.  Yes.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, clearly the fiscal cliff is having effects on the 
economy.  Even though we’ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff potentially kicking in, it’s already affecting business investment and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty or creating pessimism.  We saw wha t happened recently to consumer sentiment, which fell, 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
10 of 34 
 presumably in part because of concerns about the fiscal cliff.  So, clearly, this is a major risk 
factor and a major source of uncertainty about the economy going forward.  I would suspect and, althoug h the participants don’t all make this explicit, but I would suspect that what they are 
assuming in their projections is that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some intermediate way, whereby there is  still some fiscal drag but not as much as implied by the  entire fiscal cliff.  So I 
think that’s probably the underlying assumption that most people took when they made their projections.  But as you —you’re absolutely right that there is a lot of uncertainty right now and if 
the fiscal cliff situation turns out to be resolved in a way very different from our expectations, I’m sure you would see changes in the forecast.  
ALISTER BULL.  Alister Bull from Reuters.  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman.  Could 
you talk about whether the decision to maintain the monthly bond purchases at 85 billion a 
month represents a ramping up or additional easing to Fed policy, because you’re now going to be adding a little bit more to the size of balance sheet?  And also, you know, you’ve talked about maintaining the asset purchases unt il you see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the 
labor market , and you’ve said that you want to take a qualitative approach, but you’ve also got 
this 6½ percent inflation threshold out there as well.  So, could you talk about what sort of eviden ce you’d see to sort of make you change the pace or slow the pace of purchases?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The first part of your question was?  
ALISTER BULL.  Is this an additional stimulus or are you—  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I think this is really a continuation of what we said in 
September.  You recall in September we expressed dis satisfaction with progress in the labor 
market.  We, at that point, we began the $40 billion per month of MBS purchases and we said that unless we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market that we would 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
11 of 34 
 undertake additional asset purchases or other actions.  And that ’s what we ’ve done today is 
simply follow through on what we said we would do in September.  I don’t think that we have, 
relative to last month, I don’ t think we have significantly added to accommodation.  The reason 
is that, at least in my view and I think many of my colleagues’, that what matters primarily is the 
mix of assets on the balance sheet, on the asset side of the balance sheet.  So what’s imp ortant is 
the fact that we’re acquiring Treasury securities and MBS, taking those out of the market, you know, forcing investors into other closely related assets and that’s where the stimulus comes from, not so much in the size of the balance sheet per se .  So, in my judgment, the amount of 
stimulus is more or less the same, it’s just being continued.  It’s a follow -through from what we 
saw in September.  In terms of criteria, again, what we’ve done is we’ve announced an initial amount of 85 billion a mont h of purchases.  We are prepared to vary that as new information 
comes in.  For example, if the economy’s outlook gets noticeably stronger, we would presumably begin to ramp down the level of purchases.  But again, the problem with giving a specific number  is that there are multiple criteria o n which we make this decision.  We’ll be 
looking at the outlook for labor market, which is very important, but we’ll also be looking at other factors that may be affecting the outlook for the economy.  For example, I hope it won’t happen but if the fiscal cliff occurs, as I’ve said many times, I don’t think the Federal Reserve has the tools to offset that event and, in that case, we obviously have to temper our expectations about what we can accomplish.  Likewise, as I said, we’ll also be looking at the efficacy and costs of our program and if, you know, we find, we expect it to be efficacious but if we find that it’s not working as well as we hoped or if the various costs are emerging that we ha d not 
anticipated then th at would also have to be taken into account as we think about it.  So, we 
thought it was not constructive because we ourselves don’t know precisely what would define 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
12 of 34 
 substantial improvement .  But obviously, as long as the costs and other concerns do not em erge, 
we’ll be looking for, you know, something that is substantial in terms of a better job market.  
PETER COOK.  Peter Cook with  Bloomberg Television.  Mr. Chairman, if I could 
follow up just on your last response there.  Given the fiscal cliff, is it pos sible that if the country, 
if the policy makers were not to agree to some sort of deficit deal by the end of this year and we 
were to go over the fiscal cliff, that the size of these asset purchases could indeed grow in response to that?  And more specific ally, you coined the phrase “fiscal cliff ,” and I wanted to get 
your take on whether you still feel it’s the most appropriate language to describe what would happen at  the beginning of the year.  There are some Americans who may be alarmed by the 
language,  some economists say it’s more of a slope.  Do you still feel it’s appropriate given the 
circumstances — th e contraction, the fiscal contraction, that would come if there is no deal?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, for the first part of your question if the economy 
actually went off the fiscal cliff, our assessment, the CBO’s assessment, outside forecasters, all think that that would have very significant adverse effects on the economy and on the unemployment rate.  And so, on the margin, we would try to do what w e could.  We would 
perhaps increase a bit.  But I just want to, again, be clear that we cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff.  It’s just too big given the tools that we have available and the limitations on our policy toolkit at this point.  O n terms of the terminology, well, and people have different 
preferences about what they want to call things, I think it’s a sensible term because I think of the fiscal policies providing support to the economy.  If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary , 
the economy will, I think, go off a cliff.  I think that it’s reasonable to be concerned about this.  I don’t buy the idea that a short -term descent off the fiscal cliff would be not costly.  I think it 
would be costly and, in fact, we’re already seeing costs.  Why is it that consumer confidence 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
13 of 34 
 dropped so sharply this week?  Why is it that small business confidence dropped so sharply?  
Why is —why are the markets volatile?  Why is business investment at among its weakest levels 
during the recovery?  I thi nk all of these things, at least to some extent, can be traced to the 
anticipation and the concern about the fiscal cliff and I think that, you know, we don’t know exactly what would happen but I think there is certainly a risk that it could be serious and, therefore, I think it is very important.  The most helpful thing that could—that, I think, Congress, the Administration could do right now is find a resolution that, on the one hand, achieves long-run fiscal sustainability , which is critical, absolutely critical for a healthy economy, but also 
avoids derailing the recovery which is currently in process.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, I 
just—I want to try to square up some numbers .  The threshold that you announced today for 
when rate hikes might start is 6½ percent.  The Committee’s assessment of the longer -run 
unemployment rate is 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower, and the longer -run equilibrium fed funds 
rate is around 4 percent according to these projections .  It suggests that when the Fed does start 
raising interest rates down the road, it might have to move fairly quickly to get to some equilibrium fed funds rate.  Is that, specifically, is that the case and, more generally, can you talk about what this fra mework that you set up today says about the exit strategy that you had laid out 
some time ago and whether that’s evolving or changing?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s a good question.  So first of all, we don’t have a 
precise estimate of the long -run sustai nable unemployment rate.  The estimates that were 
provided in the Summary of Economic Projections today, as has been the case for a while, is 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  So, it could be well less than 6 ½ percent, so that gives us some time.   
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
14 of 34 
 My anticipation is that the removal of accommodation after the takeoff point, whe never 
that occurs, would be relatively gradual.  I don’t think we’re looking at a rapid increase.  Of 
course, that depends on where inflation is and other conditions.  But it’s —the path that we’r e 
basing these numbers on is one that assumes, first of all, as you anticipated, assumes a n increase 
in the funds rate first occurring some time after unemployment goes below 6½ percent, but does not necessarily assume a rapid increase after that.  And I —what we said in our statement is that 
we would take a balanced approach.  In other words, you know, once we get to that point, we may or may not raise rates at that point.  We’ll look at the situation.  But assuming that inflation remains well controlled, w hich I fully anticipate, I think that the rate of increase in rates would 
be moderate.   
This is consistent —the exit strategy that we put out is consistent with our statement today 
because the exit strategy was primarily about how we would normalize the balance sheet over time.  And at this time we have not made any changes in that, and we believe that some increase in the size of our balance sheet is consistent still with that general sequence that we laid out in the minutes a year and a half ago.  That be ing said, if the balance sheet grows by enough, we 
may have to reconsider the pace or timing of that, but I don’t see any changes that would, you know, radically change the time to normalization or the time to exit.   
ZACHARY GOLDFARB.  Thank you.  Zach Goldfarb.  I’m going to continue the two 
question trend and ask— first on the fiscal cliff, it sounds like you would prefer a sensible 
balance of fiscal consolidation and support for the recovery, but if people in  Congres s can’t do 
that in the next two weeks, do you think postponing off this whole consolidation is preferable to going over the cliff?  And then, on the monetary policy actions today, can you give us a little bit 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
15 of 34 
 more color on how you set the thresholds at wha t they were?  And what the alternatives were, 
and how you weighed various alternative but similar policies?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  I’m hoping that the Congress will do the right thing 
on the fiscal cliff.  I —you know, there’s a problem with kicking the  can down the road.  It might 
avoid some of the short -term impact on the recovery, but it could create concerns about our 
longer -term fiscal situation and I don’t want to see that.  So I think for the best —it’s in the best 
interest of the economy to come t o a two -part solution, if you will.  Part one is to modify fiscal 
policy in a way that doesn’t create enormous headwinds for the recovery in the near term.  And 
part two is to at least take important steps towards achieving a framework, at least, by which,  
perhaps through further negotiation, the Congress  and the Administration can achieve a 
sustainable path for fiscal policy.  That —both of these parts are very important.  I don’t think 
that we can consider these negotiations a success unless both of them happen.   
[Speaker unknown; i naudible r emark]  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   No.  I think they ’re equally important.  On the threshold 
numbers, this is based—these numbers are based on substantial analysis done by staff , both here 
and at the Reserve Banks, trying to assess under so -called optimal policy , or in the best policy 
that we can come up with, what would the interest rate path look like and how would it be connected or correlated with changes in unemployment and inflation.  And when we do that analy sis, what we find is that the best interest rate path —as best as we can determine it based on 
our models and analysis, which is obviously imperfect —has rates remaining low until 
unemployment drops below 6½ percent.  And it projects if we put in the two—the  half of a 
percentage point above the 2 percent goal as a kind of protection against any problem with price 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
16 of 34 
 stability, but our projections, our actual forecast suggests that inflation will not go there.  
Inflation will stay around 2 percent, which will be consistent with our longer -term objective.   
ZACH GOLDFARB.  [Inaudible Remark]   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   If we got important new information about the structure of 
the economy, it’s possible, but I consider it relatively unlikely and this is one of the best —this is 
one of the advantages of this approach over the date -based approach.  If information comes in 
which says the economy is stronger or weaker than we expected, that would, in principle, require a change in the date.  But it doesn’t necessarily require a change in the thresholds because that date adjustment can be made by markets just simply by looking at their own forecasts of when unemployment will cross the line and the behavior of inflation. 
SCOTT SPOERRY.  Scott Spoerry from CNN, sir.  When you were  appearing on 
60 Minutes , one of the things that happened was that you visited your old hometown, and you 
talked a little bit about how the economy had affected people that you grew up with and affected the people down there.  There are a lot of just regul ar people like that who are out on the 
countryside wondering what really happens to them if we do go over the federal cliff.  Taxes go 
up, spending goes down.  Do they need to look for a recession?  Are employers going to really cut back on the employment, do you think?  What do people out there really need to worry about and prepare for when it comes to actually going over that fiscal cliff, if the folks in Washington can’t get their act together?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I come from a part of South Carol ina which has been 
economically challenged for quite a long time and remains so.  I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from —mostly agricultural, it 
has a little bit of manufacturing —has a very high  unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
17 of 34 
 and people are having a hard time there.  And I’ve visited there a few times since I became 
Chairman.  
So, part of the reason that, you know, we are engaging these policies is to try and create a 
stronger economy —more jobs —so that folks across the country, including places like the one 
where I grew up, you know, will have more opportunity to have better lives for themselves.  So that’s  extremely important and I think it’s very important that we not just loo k at the numbers.  
It’s easy to look at the unemployment rate and say, well it’s one -tenth or two -tenths.  Every tenth  
means, you know, many, many people are represented there.  So it is very important to try to keep in mind the reality of unemployment, of  foreclosure, of weak wage growth, et cetera, so we 
always try to do that.  And I want to—it’s always a delicate balance— you don’t want to scare 
people.  And I actually believe that Congress will come up with a solution, and I certainly hope 
they will.  
But as many analysts, not just the Fed, have pointed out, if the fiscal cliff was allowed to 
occur, and certainly if it were sustained for any period, it could have a very negative effect on hiring, jobs, wages, economic activity, investment .  And of course, the consequences of that will 
be felt by everybody but certainly by those in areas like where I grew up that are relatively weak economically, would no doubt would feel the greater brunt.  So, it’s exceptionally urgent and important that the Congress and the Administration come to a sensible agreement on this issue.  
SCOTT SPOERRY.  Okay, sir, I had a follow -up, too.  I’m not going to ask you whether 
we’re in a bond bubble.  But obviously, the new guidance that you’ve given in the FOMC statement is going to  give a lot more clues to people who own bonds about when they might start 
lightening up their bond portfolios and changing the composition of what they own.  Was 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
18 of 34 
 concerns about information about bond prices and things happening in a big hurry, in terms of  
some sort of a bubble popping —was that a consideration in adding this transparency?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I wouldn’t say it was an important motivation for adding 
transparency.  I think transparency has a lot of value.  But it is the —it is a f act that this greater 
clarity will help markets better predict how bond yields will behave.  As we go forward in time, 
if the economy continues to strengthen as we hope, as the exit comes closer for the Federal Reserve, then you would expect longer -term bond yields to begin to rise.  And the more 
information we can provide to markets about the conditionality under which the Fed would consider removing accommodation, the better information they’ll have about the likely path of  
bonds and that will allow for a smoother adjustment.  So I think that’s a positive aspect of this communication.  It —I wouldn’t say it was the major reason.  The major reason is to give the 
markets and the public more transparency about what’s determining our policy, but that is one potential advanta ge.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, you said 
a moment ago that these thresholds are based on an analysis of optimal policy.  In the optimal 
policy path that Vice Chair Yellen laid out in her speech a few weeks ago, i t showed the first rise 
in interest rates occurring in early 2016 and then rates rising very slowly after that.  Is that the policy that the Fed is now following?  And secondly, if I may, you referred to a number of inflation forecasts in your introductory  remarks.  In that case, how will we ever know that the 
inflation threshold has been hit?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, the kind of optimal policy path that Vice Chairman 
Yellen showed is indicative of the kinds of analysis we ’ve done.  I mean, we ’ve run it for a 
variety of different scenarios, different assumptions about models , and so on, but the general 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
19 of 34 
 character of that interest rate path, i.e. , that it stays low until unemployment is in the vicinity of 
6½ or a little lower, and then rises relativ ely slowly, which goes back to the question that was 
asked earlier, that it doesn ’t involve a rapid removal of accommodation after that point is 
reached.  That is consistent with that kind of analysis, and that ’s the type of analysis that was not 
the only thing we looked at but was informative in our discussion.  You ’ll note also in that kind 
of policy path, of the type that she discussed , that inflation stays essentially at 2 or very close to 
2. 
In terms of inflation forecast, the —what the C ommittee will do on a regular basis is 
include in its statement its views of where inflation is likely to be a year from now.  For example, 
currently, we already say that, you know, we expect inflation to run at or below the Committee’s objective in a long er term.  The intellectual exercise we’ll be doing is asking ourselves if we 
maintain low rates along the lines suggested by this policy, would we ex pect inflation to cross 
the threshold or reach that level?  
Now, it’s very important that the public, the m edia, the markets find our projections 
credible, obviously.  And so for that reason, you know, we will be referring extensively to publicly available information such as various measures of inflation— I mentioned some in my 
opening remarks —outside forecasts , the breakevens from inflation protected bonds, et cetera.  
So, if our outlook deviates in any sense in a significant way from sort of what all these things are saying, at a minimum, it will be incumbent on me and the rest of us to explain that.  But my expectation is that our projections will be broadly consistent with public views, public 
information, and so I think we can manage the credibility issue.  But again, just to be clear, the projection that matters for our determination is the one that the Committee collectively comes up with.  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
20 of 34 
 BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM.  Sir, you’ve articulated more clearly than ever your 
commitment to reduce unemployment, but you’ve also said that you’re not actually doing 
anything more to achieve that goal —that you still expect it to be three years away, that you’re 
disappointed with the pace of progress, and that inflation is not the limiting factor.  What is the limiting factor?  Why is the Fed not announcing today additional measures to reduce unemployment?  What would it take for you to get that?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we took —the question was whether this was 
something new relative to September, I think September was the date where we did do a substantial increase in accommodation.  At that point, we announced our dissatisfac tion with the 
state of the labor market and the outlook for jobs and said we would take further action if the outlook didn’t improve.  And what we’ve done today is really just following through what we 
said.  So, I would say that, you know, looking at it f rom the perspective of September, that we 
have, in fact, taken significant additional action to provide support for the recovery and for job creation.  The reason —one of the considerations though, as I’ve talked about, is that, you know, 
given that we are now in the world of unconventional policy that has both uncertain costs and uncertain efficacy or uncertain benefits, you know, that creates a more —somewhat more 
complicated policy decision than the old style of just changing the federal funds rate.  You know, there are concerns that I’ve talked about in these briefings before that if the balance sheet gets indefinitely large that there would be potential risks in terms of financial stability, in terms of market functioning.  And the Committee takes these r isks very seriously.  And they impose a 
certain cost on policy that doesn’t exist when you’re dealing only with the federal funds rate.  And so what we’re trying to do here is balance the potential benefits, in terms of lower 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
21 of 34 
 unemployment and inflation at target, against the reality that as the balance sheet gets bigger that 
there’s greater costs that might be associated with that, and those have to be taken to account. 
BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM.  Sir, if I can just follow, so these forecasts presumably 
incorporat e the actions taken into account, and so given those actions, it will still be three years 
until you achieve your goals.  Is the message to people who are unemployed basically, “We are 
doing all we can? ”  Is this the conclusion that , given that balance of factors, this is the most we 
can expect?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, first of all, again, these —the projections that you’re 
looking at are based on each individual —this is not a Committee collective projection.  What 
they are, of course, is 19 separate participants making their own projections based on their own views of optimal policy.  So, for exa mple, it includes those folks who think that we shouldn’t be 
doing any more purchases and their forecasts are included in there as well.  So, it’s not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but it is true that if we could wave a magic wand and get unemplo yment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that, but there are 
constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools, and in terms of the fact that we do need to take into account, you know, the possibility of other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet. 
DARREN GERSH.  To just —Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  So just following 
up on that last question, how helpful would it be to see , as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, some 
near-term stimulus?  The President’s proposed that.  Do you think—how helpful do you think 
that would be and, I’ll ask my follow up now, whatever happened to your southern accent?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the second one, I’d like  to think I’m bilingual.  
When I go home sometimes I —it comes out pretty strongly, but I won’ t try to do that here.  So, I 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
22 of 34 
 try to be careful, as you know, not to give views on specific tax and spending programs.  I think, 
of course , obviously those are the  province of the Administration and Congress.  The attitude 
I’ve taken has been that , at a minimum, Congress should try to do no harm, that they should try 
to avoid policies that significantly slow or derail the recovery at this point.  So I think that ’s the 
critical thing along with the long -term objective of achieving a sustainable fiscal path.  Now, 
given that basic recommendation, you know, Congress can consider variations.  For example, if 
they believe that they can achieve a strong, credible future path for fiscal policy, that would give them potentially some space to do something a little bit more expansionary in the short term.  But, those are judgments I think that Congress has to make about whether they can simultaneously continue  support ive fiscal  policy in the short term while maintaining the 
credibility that, in fact, they will be addressing our structural deficit problems in the longer term.  
And that is I think really a question for them and for their staff.  
KRISTINA PETERSON.  Kristina Peterso n of Dow Jones.  Looking over the past year or 
several years, how would you evaluate the Fed’s accuracy making economic forecasts, and how does that affect the ability to make monetary policy decisions, especially as it’s connected to the thresholds?  
CHAIR MAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it’s fair to say that we have overestimated the 
pace of growth, total output growth, GDP growth, from the beginning of the recovery and we have  had therefore —had to continue to scale down our estimates of output growth.  But 
interestingly, at the same time, we have been more accurate, not perfectly accurate by any 
means, but we’ve been somewhat more accurate in forecasting unemployment.  And how do you reconcile those two things?  I talked about this in remarks I gave at the New  York Economic 
Club recently, right before Thanksgiving.  And I think the reconciliation is that what we’re 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
23 of 34 
 learning is that, at least temporarily, the financial crisis may have reduced somewhat the 
underlying potential growth rate of the U.S. economy.  It  has interfered with business creation, 
with investment, with technological advances, and so on.  And that can account for at least part of the somewhat slower growth.  At the same time, though, what —of course, what monetary 
policy influences is not potent ial growth, not the underlying structural growth.  That’s for —
many other different kinds of policies affect that.  What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy.  And there, I think we’ve also perhaps underestimated a bit the recession, but we’ve been much closer there.  And I think therefore that we’ve been able to address that somewhat more effectively with quite accommodative policies.  That being s aid, of course, we have over 
time, as we have seen disappointment in growth and job creation, we have obviously, as we did 
in September, have added accommodation and we’ve continued— we continue to reassess the 
outlook.  I think it’s only fair to say that e conomic forecasting beyond a few quarters is very, 
very difficult.  And what we basically are trying to do is create a plausible scenario which we think is reasonably likely —base policy on that, but we prepared to adjust as new information 
comes in and as the outlook changes, and inevitably it will. 
GREG IP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Ip of the Economist .  Economists have long 
believed that central banks cannot affect the unemployment rate in the long run.  That ’s one 
reason you’ ve seen a move towards central banks being given mandates for low inflation only.  
Can you explain if the Fed, by tying its monetary policy so explicitly to a n unemployment 
threshold, whether that is consistent or inconsistent with that longstanding view?  And , if it’ s 
consistent, how is this superior to simply having a threshold for inflation only ?  And would the 
approach that you ’re now taking be possible if the Fed had only a mandate for low inflation?  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s entirely consistent w ith your view, with the point 
that you made.  So let me just reiterate it.  As we stated , in fact , in our January set of principles , 
the central bank cannot control unemployment in the long run.  I’d add a caveat to this.  There’ s 
a little bit of a caveat here, which is that very extended periods of unemployment can interfere 
with the workings of the labor market.  And so, if the Fed were not to address a large unemployment problem for a long time, it might, in fact, have some influence on the long -term 
unemployment rate.  But as a general rule, as a general rule, and I think this is the right baseline, 
the long -term unemployment rate is determined by a range of structural features of the economy 
and a range of economic policies and not by monetary policy.  So that being said, what our 6½ percent threshold is is —as I said in my opening remarks, it is not a target —what it is is a 
guidepost in terms of when the beginning of the reduction of accommodation could begin.  It 
could be later than that, but at least b y that time, no earlier than that time.  So it ’s really more like 
a reaction function or a Taylor rule , if you will.  I don’t want —I’m—I’ll get— I’m ready to get 
the phone call from John Taylor.  It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation.  So, what it’s basically doing is saying how our policy will e volve over time as the economy evolves.  It has no 
implication that we can affect the long -run unemployment rate, which we believe is lower than 
6½ percent.  We think it ’s somewhere between 5 and 6 according to our SEP projections.  We 
are a dual mandate central bank and I think that providing information on both sides is more helpful.  So, I understand your point but I think that it ’s—that providing information on 
unemployment and inflation gives more information to the markets , to the public that allows 
them to infer how our policy is likely to evolve.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Unless —so long as the inflation condition is met.  It’s 
correct.  
WYATT ANDREWS.  Mr. Chairman, Wyatt Andrews, CBS News.  I’d like —still like to 
hear a little bit more about why you made this announcement today specifically tying federal 
funds and your policy to the 6.5 percent number?  I’m sure you have some sort of theory about 
what you hope changes in the economy as a result of thi s announcement.  If so, what is it?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we think it’s a better form of communication.  We 
think it’s —by using the thresholds which ties rates to economic conditions, we’re more 
transparent about what’s going to determine our policy in the future.  The date -based guidanc e, it 
served a purpose.  But it had the problem that whenever economic outlook changed, the Committee was faced with the question of whether we should change the date -based guidance, 
and we did change it a couple of times.  But that was a nontransparent pr ocess.  Nobody 
understood exactly why we made a particular change because we were not providing any kind of fundamental information about how our policy is linked to the underlying outlook.  And so, we, I believe, certainly, that this approach is superior.  I’m not saying it’s the best possible approach, 
there may be other things we can do in the future.  We’re always looking to find ways to improve our communication but I do think it’s more transparent and will allow the markets to respond quickly and prom ptly to changes in the outlook by adjusting when they think rate increases will 
begin, and therefore, it’ll act, to some extent, like an automatic stabilizer.  So if the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that 
will tend to lower longer -term rates and that would tend to be supportive of the economy.  So 
that has an automatic stabilizer type effect.  It  kind of  offsets adverse shocks.  So it’s a better 
form of communication.  As I said, we discussed it quite extensively at the last meeting.  And 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
26 of 34 
 so—and frankly, given that it’s a relatively complex change, it seemed like it would be a good 
idea to do it at a meeting where there was a press conference.  So, we decided since we’re ready 
to go w hy not make the change earlier and get the benefit earlier.  
WYATT ANDREWS.  As a quick follow- up, are you—did you see a level of uncertainty 
in the business community that you hope to solve by this announcement?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, at the moment, I think that the expectations of the 
business community and of the Federal Open Market Committee happen to be pretty well aligned.  If you look at the financial market indicators, the future federal funds rate path, it’s pretty consistent with the mid -2015 da te-based guidance that we had been providing.  So I’m not 
saying there was a major inconsistency between what the business community was expecting, the markets were expecting, and what we were expecting.  So that wasn’t really the issue.  The 
problem is th at, looking forward, that what happens if there is a significant change either for the 
better, or for the worse, in the outlook ?  Under the date -based guidance , that would require the 
Committee to determine, you know, what the new date is and to make that change in a nontransparent way.  But under this threshold- based guidance, the markets and the business 
community can make that calculation on their own and adjust that —their estimates of when rates 
will begin to increase based only on their own forecast and not have to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee to give them a date.  So we just think it’s a better approach.  
JOSH ZUMBRUN.  Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun, Bloomberg News.  By mid- 2015, the 
recovery is going to be nearly six years old.  The average postwar recovery has been a little less than five.  We’re already banking on a very long expansion.  You expect, by mid- 2015, the funds 
rate is going to be at zero percent, your balance sheet is potentially at $4 trillion.  If the business 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
27 of 34 
 cycle runs out of steam and you’ re still at zero percent interest rates, does the Fed no longer have 
a forceful response in that situation?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the Fed will always, you know, keep— we’ve 
innovated quite a bit in the last few years and it ’s always possible we could find new ways to 
provide support for the economy.  But it’ s certainly true , I’ve —you know, there’s no doubt that 
with interest rates near zero and with the balance sheet already large, that the ability to provide 
additional accommodation is n ot unlimited and that that’s just a reality and that actually is an 
argument, I think, for being a little bit more aggressive now.  I mean, it’s a really good objective to get the economy moving, to get some momentum that protects the economy against unant icipated shocks that might occur, and gets us off the  zero bound earlier.  So, exactly for 
those reasons, the kind of risks that arise when the —when policy interest rates are close to zero, 
and the  greater difficulty in providing additional policy support, I think that’s an argument for 
being somewhat more proactive now, when we still have the ability to do that, and to try to get the economy, you know, back to a healthy condition.  
DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chairman.   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Hi.  
DONNA BORAK.  Donna B orak with American Banker .  My question pertains to the 
Volcker Rule.  Regulators, earlier this year , seemed cautiously optimistic that they ’d be able to 
finalize a rule by the end of the year.  However, that seems a bit unlikely at this point.  And now, as you know, lawmakers are calling for a two -year implementation delay on the rule.  Given the 
fact that it’s been such a lengthy process, can you tell us where things stand at this point?  How much closer are we to a final rule?  Have the agencies been ab le to work out their differences ?  
And, if you may, a prediction on when we might actually see a rule.  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
28 of 34 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’ve made quite a bit of progress.  It’s a difficult, 
complex rule, as you know, and we’ve had, I think I recall, 18,000 comments or  something like 
that.  So it’s been a lot to look at.  There are a lot of concerns that arose even from, you know, 
foreign commenters about the effects on their bond markets, et cetera.  So there’s been a lot of work to do.  There, I think there is quite a  bit of agreement, I wouldn’t say a final agreement, but 
quite a bit of agreement on key points among the regulators, at this juncture.  And, of course, if Congress gives us some other instruction, we’ll follow that, but so far, we haven’t received any different instruction.  So it’s our intent to try to get this done early in 2013. 
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, Mr. Chairman.  Since your last press 
conference with us, we’ve had an election.  One of the candidates in that election, Governor Romney, said that he would not reappoint you to a third term as Chairman.  President Obama did 
not weigh in on the issue but he was —he did win reelection.  If the President were to call you 
and say, “Ben, your country needs your continued stewardship at the Fe deral Reserve.  We need 
you to stay and finish the job, see this through.”  Would you consider it?  Would you do it, and, by chance, have you had any conversations to that effect with the President or anybody on his team?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So  to answer the last part, no, I haven’t had any 
conversations.  I think the President has got quite a few issues he needs to be thinking about, from fiscal cliff to many other appointments and so on.  From my own perspective, I just, I really don’t have an ything to add from the last press conference.  I am very much engaged in these 
difficult issues that we’re discussing today, and I have not been spending time thinking about my own future.  So I don’t really have anything to add there.  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL

 KEVIN HALL.  Okay, M r. Chairman.  Thank you.  The two questions, taking the 
Goldfarb rule into effect, one having to do with the CPI, there’s a lot of debate now with the 
Boehner plan about this chained CPI.  As an econ —not as a Fed Chairman but as an 
economist —is there a log ic in going to that?  Do you think it’s a move that should be done 
separate from the politics of it?  And again, with your economist hat, the labor market, you talked about the importance, not looking at the 6.5 percent threshold, but the broader conditions.  A big debate—Steve Liesman’s nemesis talks a lot about people being beamed to Mars.  In your mind, what is happening in the job market?  Are we creating jobs?  Is that why it’s coming down or is it because people —the degree of discouraged workers?  Wha t is your sense of how quickly 
it’s fallen because of new employment?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, on the first question, the chained CPI versus the 
fixed -weight CPI is a technical issue.  The chained CPI is technically better, according to most 
economists, bec ause it allows for changes in the mix of goods and services that people actually 
consume more effectively.  However, whether, you know, whether that’s more appropriate for, say, Social Security indexing or not, I think that’s ultimately a political decisio n.  I suppose a 
rejoinder would be that neither the CPI nor the chained CPI may necessarily be a particularly good measure of the cost of living for Social Security recipients.  So, those are the kinds of questions that Congress is going to have to deal wi th.  Second part of your question was?  
KEVIN HALL.  The debate over the extent to which the unemployment rate is falling  
from —   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Ah, yes.  Sorry.  
KEVIN HALL.  New jobs versus people leaving.  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
30 of 34 
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Well, you know, you can see the comparison by 
looking, for example, at the household survey, which gives estimates of how many people are 
added to the labor force, how many are added to the employed, how many people are leaving the labor force, and it’s true that part of the decline in unemployment —and indeed all of it in the last 
reading, but over the recovery, part of the decline in unemployment has come from declines in participation rates, that is, people leaving the labor force.  Some of that decline in participation appears to be due to longer -run factors, aging and changing patterns of work among women.  So 
those things were probably not directly related to the recession, for example.  But beyond that downward trend, there’s been some additional decline in labor force participation, and in the ratio of employment to population, which presumably is linked to discouragement about the state of the labor force.  So that certainly is part of the issue.  That being said, obviously there has 
been a good bit of job creation.  Y ou can see that either in the household survey or in the payroll 
establishment survey.  So I think there’s no doubt that the labor market is considerably better today than it was two years ago, there’s not any question about that.  But it’s also the case t hat 
many indicators of the labor market remain quite weak, ranging from the number of long -term 
unemployed to the number of people who have part -time work who would like full -time work.  
Wage growth obviously is very weak, and I could go on.  So, it may be  that the labor market is 
even a bit weaker than the current unemployment rate suggests, but I think that it is nevertheless the case that there has been improvement since the trough a couple of years ago.  
CATHERINE HOLLANDER.  Mr. Chairman, Catherine Hol lander from National 
Journal .  How concerned are you that markets will have to tank in order to get lawmakers to 
reach a deal on the fiscal cliff, and what do you make of their recent complacency?  Is there a Wall Street –Washington disconnect?  
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
31 of 34 
 CHAIRMAN BER NANKE.  Interesting question.  Well, I certainly hope that markets 
won’t have to tank.  I don’t —we want to have confidence, not just in markets but in businesses 
and households as well, and the best way the fiscal policymakers can achieve that is by coming  
to a solution as quickly as possible.  Markets have obviously already responded to some extent, 
up and down;  you can see from day to day how they respond to news about the negotiations.  But 
on the other hand, it’s also true , if you look at the experience , I think the  very informative 
experience of the debt limit debate in August of 2011, that both confidence and markets remain pretty sanguine up to pretty close to the point where it looked like there was actually a chance the debt limit would not be raise d.  And then, of course, there was a pretty sharp shock, particularly 
to confidence, about the time of the, you know, of the final debates.  So it’s not unusual to see markets being complacent.  Of course, there’s from a market point of view, there are sor t of risks 
in both directions.  Obviously, things go badly, but perhaps if things go especially well, that would be good news, and maybe right now markets are sort of taking an average of those two possibilities.  But again, just to reiterate, I don’t thin k any policymaker, including the Fed, should 
be responding to markets.  What we should be doing is making policy, you know, based on the fundamentals and doing what’s best for the economy and I hope that fiscal policymakers will follow that injunction as w ell. 
STEVE BECKNER.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Beckner of Market News International.  With 
the federal government borrowing roughly $1 trillion a year and now with the Fed on pace to buy roughly a trillion dollars a year in bonds, are you concerned about a public , and possibly global , 
perception that the Fed is accommodating not just growth but accommodating federal borrowing needs, and are you concerned about what this might do to the Fed’ s credibility , and the 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
32 of 34 
 credibility of U.S. finances in general, and t he credibility of the dollar as the world’s leading 
currency?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first of all, just a couple of facts.  The —we’re buying 
Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities, about half and half, roughly.  So we’re buying 
considerably less than the Treasury is issuing and, moreover, the share of outstandi ng Treasuries 
that the Federal Reserve owns is not all that different from what it was before the crisis, because 
while our holdings have increased, so has the —obviously the stock of Treasuries in public hands.   
So it’s not quite evident that there has be en such a radical shift there.  You know, we’ve been 
increasing our balance sheet now for some time, and we’ve been very clear that this is a temporary measure.  It’s a way to provide additional accommodation to an economy which needs support.  We’ve been equally clear that we will normalize the balance sheet, that we will reduce 
the size of our holdings and—whether by letting them run off or by selling assets in the future.  So this is, again, only a temporary step.  It would be quite a different matter if  we were buying 
these assets and holding them indefinitely.  That would be monetization.  We’re not doing that.  We are very clear about our intentions.  And I think up until now, it seems our credibility has been quite good.  There is not any sign either of current inflation or of any —there’s no strong 
evidence that there are any increases in inflation expectations for that matter, looking at financial markets, looking at surveys, looking at economic forecasts, and so on.  So, this is one of the things tha t we have to look at.  Remember, I talked earlier about the potential costs of a large 
balance sheet.  We want to be sure that there’s no misunderstanding, that there’s no effect on inflation expectations from the size of our balance sheet.  That’s one of the things we have to look at, but as to this point, there just really is no evidence that people are taking it that way.  And I guess it’s worth pointing out —of course we’ve been very focused on the United States 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
33 of 34 
 here, but we’re not the only central bank that has increased the size of its balance sheet.  The 
Japanese, the Europeans, the British have all done the same, and very much more or less to the same extent in terms of the fraction of GDP, and I think the sophisticated market players and the public understand that this is part of a collective need, a need to provide additional accommodation to weak economies and not an accommodation of fiscal policy.  
GREG ROBB.  Last but not least, Greg Robb, MarketWatch.  There seems to be growing 
evidence that some of the MBS purchases, the impact of the MBS purchases, are that banks are holding on to some of the gains and not passing them on to the borrowers.  Is there anything you can do about that and are you concerned about that?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  S o the question is —just to restate your question —is about 
the spread between the mortgage rates that the public pays and the yields to mortgage -backed 
securities that banks may hold, and the question is, is that spread widening so that the full benefit of the reduction in MBS yields is not being passed through, that’s the question.  Well, I have to 
make sure everybody heard it, so you could answer.  Our analysis suggests that it takes time —
two points.  The first point is that while we don’t expect a hundred percent pass -through of MBS 
yields to mortgage rates, our empirical and theoretical analysis —and we’ve had quite a bit of 
work done on this issue —suggests that over time, the great majority of the decline in MBS yields 
does get passed through to mortgage r ates.  So we do anticipate, over time, that the full benefit 
will, or most of the benefit will, be seen by retail customers.  And indeed, we have seen already a pretty significant decline since September in retail mortgage rates.  But one thing that’s perh aps 
confusing this issue a little bit is that there are other things happening in the economy which are affecting those spreads.  So, for example, ther e are capacity limitations, which are allowing 
banks to, you know, to charge higher yields, there’s extra  costs like concerns about putback risk, 
December 12, 2012  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
 
34 of 34 
 for example.  There’s higher g -fees.  So there’s a number of things happening in the economy 
which will tend, all else equal, to raise that spread between mortgage rates and MBS yields, so 
that’s unfortunate.  What we can try to do there, of course, is to try to encourage good policy, for example, on putbacks, that will reduce the perceived risk and cost to the banks of making mortgage loans.  But again, you know, I think most of those things, like g -fees, for exampl e, are 
not really in our control, but, again, taking all those issues as constant, it does seem to be the case that, over a period of time, not immediately, but over a period of time, most of the declines in MBS yields do find their way through to mortgage  customers and thereby strengthen the housing 
market.

1 of 26 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference 
March 20, 2013  
 
 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Good afternoon.   
The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two- day meeting earlier today.   As 
always, my colleagues and I review ed recent economic and financial developments and 
discuss ed the economic outlook.  The data since our January meeting  have been generally 
consistent  with our expectation that the fourth -quarter pause in the recovery w ould prove 
temporary  and that moderate economic growth w ould resume.   Spending by households and 
businesses has continued to expand, and the housing sector has seen  further gains .  The jobs 
market has  also shown signs of improvement  over the past six  month s or so :  Private payrolls are 
growing more quickly , total hours of work have increased, the  rate of filings of  new claims for 
unemployment insurance has fallen , and the unemployment rate has continued to tick down.  
However, at 7.7 percent, t he unemployme nt rate remains elevated.   The Committee also remains 
concerned  that restrictive fiscal policies may  slow economic growth and job creation in coming 
months.   
We continue to monitor the recent increase s in gasoline prices, which appear to be due 
mostly to passing factors such as refinery shutdowns for maintenance.  Apart from temporary 
variations in energy prices, i nflation is  running somewhat below the Committee’s longer -run 
objective of 2 percent .  Importantly , longer -term inflation expectations remain stable .  Overall, 
still-high unemployment , in combination with relatively low inflation , underscores the need  for 
policies that will support progress toward s maximum employment in a context of price stabi lity.   
In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the 
7 Board m embers and 12 Reserve Bank p residents —submitted individual economic projections .  
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
2 of 26 As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of  appropriate 
monetary policy.  To summarize, the participants’  projections for economic growth ha ve a 
central tendency of 2.3 to 2.8 percent  for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.7 percent  in 2015.  T he central 
tendency of their  projections  of the unempl oyment rate for the fourth quarter of this  year is  7.3 to 
7.5 percent , declining to 6.0 to 6.5 percent  in the final quarter of 2015.  M ost participants see 
inflation  gradually increasing toward the  Committee’s longer -run target; the central tendency of 
their projections for inflation is  1.3 to 1.7 percent this year and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2015.   
As you already know from the policy statement, we are continuing the asset purchase 
program  first announced in September .  This decision was supported by our  review at the 
meeting of the likely efficacy, costs, and risks of additional  purchases.   Let me bri efly summarize  
the cost –benefit analysis  supporting our  decision.   
Although estimates  of the efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are 
necessarily uncertain, most participants agreed that these purchases —by putting downward 
pressure on longer -term interest rates, including mortgage rates —continue to provide meaningful 
support to economic growth and job creation.  However, most also agreed that this monetary tool 
would likely not be able on its own t o fully offset  major  economic headwinds, such as those that 
might arise from significant near -term fiscal restraint or from  a sharp  increase in global financial 
stresses .   
We also had a tho rough discussion of possible costs and risks of continued expansion of 
the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.   The risks include  possible  adverse implications of 
additional purchases for  the functioning of securities markets, and the potential effects —under 
various scenarios —of a larger balance sheet on the Federal Reserve’s earnings from its asset 
holdings and, hence, on its remittances to the Treasury.   The C ommittee also considered  possible 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
3 of 26 risks to financial stability, such as  might arise if persistently low  rates lead some market  
participants to take on excessive risk in a “reach for yield .”  In the Committee’s view, these costs 
remain manageable but will continu e to be monitor ed, and we will take them into appropriate 
account as we determine the size, pace, and composition of our  asset purchases.    
As for today, our policy decision had two main elements.  First , the Committee decided 
to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage -backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per 
month and longer -term Tr easury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  It bears 
emphasizing  that the Committee has described this pr ogram in terms of a monthly pace  of 
purchases, rather  than as a total amount of expected purchases, and has tie d the evolution of the 
progra m to economic criteria—specifically, to the achievement of a substantial improvement in 
the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  Within this framework , the 
Committee could vary the pace of purchases as progress is made toward i ts economic o bjectives  
or if its assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program changes .  At this meeting , the 
Committee judged that no adjustment was warranted.   
Second , the Committee kept the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  and 
reaffirmed its expectation  that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy  will remain 
appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic 
recovery strengthens .  In particular, we  anticipate that this exceptiona lly low range  for the funds 
rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half  percentage 
point above the Committee’s longer -run infl ation goal of 2 percent, and longer -term inflation 
expectations continue to be well anchored .   
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
4 of 26 I should note , as I have on other occasions, that the economic conditions provided in this 
forward guidance are thresholds, not triggers.  Crossing one or more of these thresholds  will not 
lead automatically to an increase in rates.   Rather, the Committee will assess at that time whether 
the outlook just ifies raising its target for the federal funds rate.  This guidance will help market 
participants assess how th e Federal Reserve’s interest  rate policy is likely to respond to economic 
developments, but its broader purpose  is to assure households and businesses that monetary 
policy will continue to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth and job 
creation picks up.  In their individual projections, 14 of the 19 FOMC participants saw the first 
increase in the target for the federal funds rate as occurring in 2015 or 2016.   
Let me comment  briefly on how the two main pieces of our policy accommodation—
asset purchases and guidance about future changes in the federal funds rate —fit together.   The  
purpose of the asset purchases is to increase the economy’s near -term momentum, with the goal 
of improving the outlook for the labor market and helping to promot e a self -sustaining recovery  
with price stability .  The forward rate guidance, in turn, provides information about when the 
Committee will begin consider ing the removal of policy accommodation through increases  in the 
target for the federal funds rate.  Importantly, the Committee expects a considerable interval  to 
pass between the time when the Committee will cease adding accommodation  through asset 
purchases  and the time when it will be appropriate to begin removing accommodation by moving 
the federal fund s rate target  toward more normal levels.   As always, in deciding on the appropriate 
stance of policy, t he Committee will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer -run goals 
of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.    
In sum, the Committee  anticipates moderate economic growth, supported by household 
and business spending and a strengthening housing sector.  T he labor market has shown signs of 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
5 of 26 improvement in recent months, but the  unemployment rate remains elevated .  Inflation is 
expected to  remain low , and fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive.  In light of its  
outlook, and following a review of the efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its asset purchase program and  its federal funds g uidance.    
Thank you very much .  I would be glad to take your questions.   
YLAN MUI.  Hi.  Ylan Mui, Washington Post .  My question is around QE.  Obviously, 
we’ve seen some of your colleagues give more -specific criteria, give some color around what 
they’re looking for before they would consider exiting from QE.  Can you give us any additional 
color on what you’ re looking for specifically in terms of substantial improvement in  the labor 
market?  And does the fact that there aren ’t thresholds associated with QE say anything about the 
level of disagreement among the C ommittee members over what that exit should look like?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, to  take your second question first , the lack of 
thresholds comes from the complexity of the problem.  On the one  hand, we have benefits, which 
are associated with improvements in the economy, but there are also costs associated with unconventional policy, such as potential effects o n financial stability, which are hard to quantify 
and which people have different vie ws about.  So , to this point, we ’ve not been able to give 
quantitative thresholds for the asset purchases in the same way that we have for the federal funds rate target.  We ’re going to continue to try to provide information as we go forward.  In 
particula r, as I mentioned today, as we make progress towards our objective, we may adjust the 
flow rate of purchases month to month to appropriately calibrate the amount of accommodation we’re providing given the outlook for the labor market.   
In terms of further color, again, given the complexity of the issue, we ’ve not given 
quantitative analysis or quantitative thresholds.  I would say that we ’ll be looking for sustained 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
6 of 26 improvement in a range of key labor market indicators, including , obviously , payrolls, 
unemployment rate, but also others like the hiring rate, claims for unemployment insurance, quit 
rates, wage rates, and so on.  We ’ll be looking for sustained improvement across a range of 
indicators , and in a way that ’s taking place throughout the economy.  And since we ’re looking at 
the outlook—we ’re looking at the prospects rather than the current state of the labor market — 
we’ll also be looking at things like growth to try to understand whether there ’s sufficient 
momentum in the economy to pr ovide demand for labor going forward.  So that will allow us to 
look through, perhaps, some temporary fluctuations associated with short- term shocks or 
problems.   
ROBIN HARDING.   Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, to follow 
up on that last point, what —you referred to the possibility of varying purchases , the rates of 
purchases per month.  W hat’s the difference in the conditions that would induce you to do that , 
as opposed to the substantial improvements in the labor market that would induce you to stop the program altogether?  Thank you.   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the problem with having just a single criterion is that 
it’s all or nothing.  We maintain full spe ed ahead until we hit a certain target, and then, you 
know, we stop.  That would be , I think, very difficult for the markets to understand, to anticipate.  
We think it makes more sense to have our policy variable , which is the rate of flow of purchases , 
respond in a more continuous or sensitive way to changes in the outlook.  So, as we make 
progress towards our ultimate objective of substantial improvement, we may adjust the rate of flow of purchases accordingly.  Now, we won ’t do that every meeting ; we won ’t do that 
frequently .  But when we see that the condition or the situation has changed in a  meaningful 
way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
7 of 26 consistent with the outlook, a nd, secondly, to help provide the markets with some sense of 
progress —how much progress is being made so that it can make better judgments.   
ROBIN HARDING.  Could you define “ progress towards ” at all , how you deal with that?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, you know, as I just described what I mean by 
“substantial improvement,”  it’s a broad -based improvement in a range of indicators as well as 
improvement in output and  labor demand.  So, as we move —we see partial improvements, see 
modest improvement , as we see a per iod in which the labor market is doing better, and we have 
reason to think it might be stronger, then we might reduce accommodation at that point.  But it 
works in both directions .  If, subsequently , the labor market were to weaken, the outlook were to 
get worse, we could, of course , bring back accommodation back to the previous level.   
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman from CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I have to keep coming 
back to this issue of adjusting the flow rate .  Are we near that time right now?  And how can the 
markets calibrate the number to changes in economic i mprovement ?  For example, let ’s say , 
theoretically , we did 236,000 jobs in a month, and the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percent .  
Would that be sufficient to begin to adjust the purchas es downward?  Thank you.   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, that’ s going to be obviously a decision that the 
Committee has to make , and we will —at each meeting, we’ ll look at progress  that’s been made 
since the last meeting, try to assess the outlook, try to dete rmine whether there ’s been a sufficient 
change to warrant  a change in our policy stance.  Internally, we ’ll use models and other 
indicators of the state of the labor market to try to make a good estimate of how much we need to change the rate of flow.  But, again, the point of this is to let the market see our behavior , to let 
them see how we respond to changes in the outlook.  A nd that way there will be a better ability, I 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
8 of 26 hope, for the markets to anticipate either a return to higher levels of purchases or the ultimate 
phasing -out of the program.   
STEVE LIESMAN.  Are we near that level now?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That ’s an issue for —obviously, there has been 
improvement , let me say that.  We ’ve seen improvement in the last four or five months.  The last 
five months, for example, we ’ve seen over 200,000 jobs a month in the private sector .  
Unemployment rate  has come down four -tenths since September.  Unemployment claims, 
insurance claims are at the lowest level they ’ve been since the crisis, so we are seeing 
improvement.  I think one thing we would need is to make sure that this is not a temporary 
improvement.  So , we’ve seen periods before where we had as many as 300,000 jobs for a couple 
of months, and then things weakened again.  So , I think an important criterion would be not just 
the improvement that we ’ve seen, but is it going to be sustained for a number of months?    
PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask you 
about Cyprus a little bit, because you guys removed the reference in  the statement referring to 
easing financial conditions , suggesting that you are alert to these new ri sks that seem to have 
emerged.  Doesn ’t the fact that a country as small as Cyprus can set off such global 
reverberations suggest that the financial system is perhaps a lot more fragile than the Fed stress test suggest s?  And then, separately, you discount ed the estimate of the “ too big to fail”  subsidy 
that Elizabeth Warren threw at you during the Senate hearing a couple weeks ago.  I was 
wondering, does the Fed have its own estimate of what that subsidy is, and could you tell us what it is, if that’ s the case?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, first, on the reverberations, it ’s a difficult situation in 
Cyprus.  You ’ve got a situation where the banking system is a large multiple of  the size of the 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
9 of 26 economy.  And so, in the financial sense, it ’s bigger than it is i n a GDP sense.  And it ’s a 
difficult problem because the country faces both fiscal and bank capitalization issues.  And 
you’ve seen that there ’s political stress in terms of trying to figure out how they ’re going to meet 
the demands of the euro group for contributing to their rescue.  So, there are a lot of uncertainties 
and difficulties , and there ’s questions about how —the way Cyprus is treated , what implications 
that might have for other countries and the like.  So, it does have some consequence .  But , having 
said that, you know, the vote failed and the markets are up today , and I don ’t think that the 
impact has been enormous.  I mean , I think it ’s something we ’re paying attention to.  We hope 
that the Europeans will come up with an efficient and equitable solution.  We are monitoring very carefully, but , at this point, we ’re not seeing a major risk to the U .S. financial system or the 
U.S. economy.   
On the benefits of being too big to fail, no, we don ’t have an estimate.  It’s pretty difficult 
to control for all the factors that go into determining the size of the subsidy.  I think there is some 
evidence that financial markets are, at least to some extent, taking into account the possibility that large financial institution s will fail.  You see, for example, spreads in the credit default 
swaps that  indicate some probabi lity of failure.  You see some discrimination among different 
institutions according to the bond market —interest rates that they get charged , and so on.  So 
there is some evidence of market discrimination.   
That being said, I certainly never meant to say to Senator Warren —and I share her 
concern about too- big-to-fail, I think it ’s a major issue —I never meant to imply that the problem 
was solved and gone.  It is n ot solved and gone ; it’s still here, but there ’s a lot of work in train.  
We’re putting in the Basel capital standards.  We’ re putting in the orderly liquidation authority 
from Dodd–Frank .  We ’re working with our international partners.  And I hope that  we’ll make 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
10 of 26 progress against too- big-to-fail, because I agree with her 100 percent that it ’s a real problem and 
needs to be addressed if at all possible.    
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman , I’d 
like to change the sub ject a little.  Your predecessor served as Fed Chairman for 19 years.  By 
contrast, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have 8 -year term limits on—for 
their top people.  I wanted to ask you two questions  related to that.  First, as a matter o f 
governance, do you think 8 years is the right amount of time for a central bank leader to serve , or 
should it be less or more , or undefined?  And , more specifically, as it regards to you, your term is 
10 years from completion .  How are you thinking about  what you will be doing next year after 
your term is completed?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the latter question, I don ’t have anything for you.  
I’ll certainly be informing the Wall Street Journal  and other publications if I come to some 
decision or som e developments in that front.   
In terms of term limits, I don ’t have a strong view on that.  Different countries use 
different approaches.  Of course, the P resident always has the option to reappoint or not 
reappoint Fed Chairm en, and the Senate always ha s the option of confirming or not conf irming.  
So, in that respect, term limits are redundant.  And , indeed, if you had term limits on the Fed 
Chairman , that would be , I think, the only office in the federal government besides P resident and 
Vice P resident that would have that restriction.   
But that being said, again, I don ’t view this as a major issue , nor have I seen it actively 
discussed in, I think, in the Hill .  Perhaps I missed it.  But I don ’t have a strong view about that.  
My 10- year term , of course , is not as Chairman.  My 10- year remaining term is as a G overnor , so 
that’s not relevant , really , to the question that you asked about.   
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
11 of 26 BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  I want to go back 
to asset purchases.  You ’ve sp oken a lot about the power of forward guidance, the power of clear 
communication.  I understand that it ’s a complicated issue, but why would you leave on the table 
the additional power of saying to markets, “W e’re going to keep doing this for a while ”?  And, 
separately, there ’s been a lot of conversation about the risks associated with quantitative easing.  
I wonder if you could tell us , when is the last time you spoke with someone who is unemployed?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Pretty recently .  I have a relative that is unemployed .  But I 
come from a small town in South Carolina that has taken a big hit from the recession.  Last time 
I was there, the unemployment rate was about 15 percent.  I think it ’s better now.  The home that 
I was raised in had just been for eclosed upon when I was visiting there.  I have great concern 
about the unemployed both for their own sake , but also because the loss of skills, the loss of 
labor force attachment is bad for our whole economy.  It reduces tax revenues .  It reduces 
producti vity.  So I think it ’s very, very important that we act to address unemployment , and I 
think the Federal Reserve— I think most people would agree —the Federal Reserve has been 
fairly active in that regard.    
In terms of costs, there are a number of different  costs , and I mentioned some of them in 
my remarks.  I think one that has recently been discussed—Governor Stein brought it up in a 
speech —is the issue of financial stability.  Clearly, financial in stability , if it were allowed to be 
sufficiently serious , would be a threat to employment, a threat to jobs , and a threat to production.  
So, obviously, given the experience of the past few years, we want to be sure that we ’re not 
unnecessarily encouraging excessive risk -taking or other problems in the financial  markets.  We 
do address that through a number of means , including monitoring the financial system, 
regulation , supervision, communication, and the like .  But this is a potential concern that a 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
12 of 26 number of my colleagues are worried about , and it ’s one of the  things we talked about in our 
discussion of the costs and risks of balance sheet policies.   
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Then why would you leave forward guidance on the table?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’ t know what you mean by “ on the table.”    
BINYAMIN APPELB AUM.  Why not use it as a tool to increase the power of asset 
purchases?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, I don’ t—we ’ve not been able to come to an 
agreement about what guidance we should give .  And part of the concern is —is that as we go 
forward , we—you know, we ’ll have to factor in the efficacy , which is another issue.  I mean, 
there’ s a wide range of views about how effective asset purchases are in terms of moving the 
economy.  So , as we move forward in time, we’ ll be learning about how effective the p olicy is , 
and what cost s and risks  there may be associated with it.  And , as we do that, perhaps we w ill be 
able to give more -explicit guidance.  And I agree with you 100 percent that that would be more 
effective if we could give numerical guidance.  But, you know, I think the Federal Reserve has 
come a long way.  You know, in 1994, we didn’ t even tell people when we changed the federal 
funds rate.  Now, we ’re telling you when— you know, what the state of the economy is going to 
be when we raise the federal funds rate.  So, we are making progress in terms of forward 
guidance.    
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak with American Banker .  There have been a 
number of policies that have been float ed in the last few months regarding of strengthening U .S. 
banks , one being increased —perhaps making adjustments to the Basel III ’s leverage ratio , 
requiring banks to hold long -term unsecured debt in the  event of a resolution, and then, also , 
placing a cap on banks’  nondeposit liabilities.  Firstly , is—do you agree with t hese policies and  
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
13 of 26 whether or not the Fed should be pursuing them along with supervisors?  And , secondly, in the 
context of this question of too- big-to-fail, I mean, do you think these policies would actually help 
to finally convince the market and the publ ic that too -big-to-fail doesn ’t exist?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think capital is an important element in addressing 
too-big-to-fail.  One of the things that will be proposed, and is not in effect yet , will be 
surcharges on the largest banks —that is , the largest financial institutions will have to hold more 
capital as a percent of their risk -weighted assets than smaller banks do.  That will increase their 
cost of funding and, to some extent , will both equalize their cost of funding with other banks and 
make them safer so that the risk of their failure is limited.  So I think that ’s an important step.  
And there are many other restrictions in both Dodd–Frank and Basel, including liquidity 
restrictions and so on, that apply most strictly to the largest institutions.   
In terms of the financing, it is true, I think, that excessive reliance on short -term 
uninsured funding does present some risks.  And there are different ways to address that.  But 
one way to address it is through liquidity regulation.  And both in our 165–166 rule and now through Basel III, we will be putting forward restrictions on the kinds of financing , the limits on 
how much illiquidity and liquidity risk firms can take.   
Again, I don’ t think too- big-to-fail is solved now.  We ’re doing a number of things , 
which I think will help.  We need to keep assessing that , and we ’ll be able to tell by looking at 
market indicators , by doing our own stress test s and the like.  And if we don’ t, you know, if we 
don’t achieve the goal, I think we ’ll have to do additional steps.  It is important.  I mean, it ’s not 
something we can just forget about.  It may take some time, but too -big-to-fail was a major part 
of the source of the crisis.  And we will not have successfully responded to the crisis if we don’ t 
address that problem successfully.    
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
14 of 26 JEFF KEARNS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jeff Kearns from Bloomberg.  Looking at 
the level for credit scores  for new home loans rising into the 700s —is that something you would 
consider to be a successful transm ission of monetary policy , and the —especially given how well 
the Fed says that banks are capitalized ?   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the tightening of credit in mortgage markets —I mean, 
our sense is that it ’s gone too far.  I mean, some tightening was obviously needed.  There were 
people who bought houses prior to the crisis who really couldn’ t sustain a mortgage.  So , terms 
and conditions have been tightened up, and we ’re now seeing much higher credit quality 
requirements on potential borrowers.  We are concerned that a variety of factors , such as 
concerns about putbacks the banks may have , uncertainties about regulation —which we ’re 
working on to get done as quickly as possible —may have tightened the mortgage credit box 
more than would be desirable in a long -run healthy economy.  That does have some effect on 
monetary policy.  One of the most powerful tools we have is bringing down mortgage rates and 
stimulating homebuying , construction, and related industries.  So that is an issue that we take 
into account.  I would say one thing , which is that as the housing industry has strengthened and 
home prices have gone up, that has actually brought some people into the credit box in the sense that the number of people, for example, who are underwater on their mortgages is declining as house prices go up.  So , as people have bigger down payments, bigger equity in their homes, 
they become more creditworthy.  So, to some extent, not —I don’ t want to overstate it—but to 
some extent, monetary  policy —by strengthening the housing market , helping support house 
prices —is bringing more people into the mortgage market.   
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes of Fox Business, sir.  The stock market has been hitting 
all-time highs.  It’s recovered all of its losses from the financial crisis.  I just want to know if I —
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
15 of 26 from you , if I still have time to get in.   But seriously, how do you feel about that?  Is it good?  Is 
it bad?  Mission accomplished?  And are you worried about bubbles?  We’re still at 7.7 percent 
unemployment.  I mean , is the —what do you think?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That ’s right.  We ’re not targeting asset prices.  We ’re not 
measuring success in terms of the stock market.  We’re measuring success in terms of our 
mandate, wh ich is employment and price stability , and that ’s what we’ re trying to achieve.  We 
do monitor the entire financial system, not just the parts that we supervise or regulate.  It 
includes the stock market and other asset markets.  We use a variety of metrics.  And I don’ t 
want to , now , be pulled into going through every individual financial market and assessing it.  
But, in the stock market, you know, we don’ t see at this point anything that’ s out of line with 
historical patterns.  In particular, you should remember , of course , that while the Dow may be 
hitting a high, it’ s in nominal term s, it’s not in real terms.  And if you adjust for inflation and for 
the growth of the economy, you know, we ’re still some distance from the high.  I don’ t think it’ s 
all that surprising that the stock market would rise , given that there has been increased optimism 
about the economy and the share of income going to profits has been very high.  P rofit increases 
have been substantial, and the relationship between stock prices and earnings is not particularly 
unusual at this point.   
MARCY GORDON.  Thank you.  Marcy Gordon with the Associated Press.  Mr. 
Chairman, the statement mentions that fiscal policy has become more restrictive.  How much of a drag o n growth do you see from the Social Security tax increase and the across -the-board 
spending cuts that went into effect on March 1?   And is it possible that the Fed might see a need 
to provide more support to the economy if that —because of that drag , the drag  on fiscal?    
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
16 of 26 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, our analysis is fairly comparable to analysis that the 
Congressional Budget Office has presented to the Congress.  And they estimate that putting 
together all the fiscal measures , including the f iscal c liff deal,  the s equester, and other cuts, that 
federal f iscal restraint in 2013 is cutting something like 1½ percentage points off of growth, 
which, of course, is very significant.  So , that is an issue for us.  We —you know, we take as 
given what the fiscal authorit ies are doing.  The economy is weaker.  Job creation is slower than 
it would be otherwise.  And so, that is one of the reasons that our policy has been as aggressive as it is.  That being said, as I ’ve said many times, monetary policy cannot offset a fisca l restraint 
of that magnitude , and so the final outcome will be wors e—or, in terms of jobs —than would 
have been the case with less fiscal restraint.  I want to emphasize that I do believe that long -term 
fiscal stability is extremely important.  And I urge Congress  and the  Administration , as I always 
do, when I go to testify to do whatever is necessary to put us on a sustainable fiscal path going 
forward.  But , in doing so, I think it ’s a good idea to pay attention to the impact in the near term 
on what is s till not a completely satisfactory recovery.    
STEVE BECKNER .  Mr. Chairman, good afternoon.  You earlier stressed that you want 
to see improvement in the labor market sustained , and that to make that determination, you have 
to have adequate economic growt h, and yet the projections in the revised Summary of Economic 
Projections has kind of a —it seems like an Okun ’s law dilemma there.  You —they have reduced 
the projected rate of unemployment, but , at the same time , lowered the growth forecast.  So how 
do you square those two?  How do you get sustained improvement in the labor market if the economy is going to slow down?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, if in fact that happens, it ’s an issue , obviously.  
There’ s been some disconnect , at least in the sh ort run , between unemployment rate changes and 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
17 of 26 growth during this recovery, and there ’ve been periods , at least , where unemployment has fallen 
relatively quickly even though growth has been more limited.  So we ’re just going to have to 
monitor developments  in the economy and see what happens.  You ’re right that we ’re not 
forecasting extraordinarily strong growth.  But it is also true , as you —I think, you noted, that our 
projections for unemployment in the fourth quarter are noticeably lower than they were i n 
September when we first announced this asset purchase program.  So there has been some 
improvement in the outlook, as measured by that metric.  But you’ re right.  You know, we do 
need to see a sustained improvement.  One month, two months doesn’ t cut it.   And , normally, 
you would expect that you would need to see a reasonable pace of GDP growth in order to achieve that.  So we ’re just going to have to keep providing support for the economy and see —
you know, see how things evolve.   
VICTORIA McGRANE .  Hi, Chairman.  Victoria McGrane with the Dow Jones 
Newswires.  In the stress test that the Fed recently conducted, there were an adverse scenario and 
a severely adverse scenario, and you published results of the —from the individual banks on—
under the adver se—severely adverse scenario .   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Right.    
VICTORIA McGRANE .  But you didn’ t under the merely adverse scenario , which 
featured a n inflation shock followed by a quick rise in short -term rates.  So , I have a two -part 
question.  First, why didn’ t the Fed publish those results?  And , second, even if you can’ t share 
how individual banks performed, what did you learn from how —from the results you did see 
under that adverse scenario?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, the reason for publishing the seve rely adverse 
scenario, of course, is that ’s the ultimate acid test, you know, whether the banks are sufficiently 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
18 of 26 capitalized.  Presumably, if they can survive a severely adverse scenario, then an adverse 
scenario would—obviously less strenuous, less stress ful, and  they wouldn ’t have as much 
difficulty.  So , I think, in terms of evaluating the health of the banks, the severely adverse 
scenario is the right one.  That being said, I don’ t see any principl e reason why we couldn’ t 
provide that information.  I will find out at some point why we are doing it that way.   
The severely adverse scenario is mostly just a scaling -up of the adverse scenario, f or the 
most part .  There are some differences.  For example, we have used some of our work to look at 
interest  rate risk and interest rate sensitivity  and, you know, found generally that banks can also 
sustain a significant increase in long -term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of 
them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.  So, again, I think the severely adverse scenario is the one that really puts them to the test.  But we ’re always talking about, you know, what information will be useful 
to investors and to the  press.    
RYAN AVENT .  Ryan Avent, The Economist .  You’ve noted that most of the C ommittee 
members don’ t expect an increase in rates until 2015 or 2016, and it looks , in the projections , as 
though the expectation for the long- run rate of the federal f unds target is around 4 percent , which 
would be below the sort of peak rate we saw before the recession.  Given the C ommittee ’s 
concerns about unconventional policy, is there any feeling on the C ommittee that perhaps 
recovery isn ’t going fast enough, and that m ore accommodation would be justified?  And has 
there been any discussion about a change in policy targets to try to stay effective without much of a cushion there between the f ed funds target rate and the zero lower bound?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as yo u point out, we ’re at the zero lower bound, and 
that makes further accommodation not impossible but more difficult and harder to predict , and 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
19 of 26 with more side effects that are difficult to predict.  I’m not sure I understand the whole thrust of 
your question.  We have —as you know, we have given this guideline for —so we call them 
signposts for how the funds rate is going to evolve over time.  And , as a lot of academic research 
shows, you know, when you’ re close to the zero lower bound, by telling markets that you’re 
going to keep rates low for a significant period, that ’s one way to get longer -term rates down and 
to provide more stimulus to the economy.  And we think this has been a pretty effective tool.  
Now, we could go further.  We could lower even further , say, the unemployment rate number 
that we hit.  We ’ve discussed variants , and at least one member of the C ommittee has suggested 
that.  But for right now, we find that the thresholds that we have put into that rate guidance seem to be sufficient to approx imate the —what ’s called the optimal c ontrol path of i nterest r ates, that 
it seems to give a path of unemployment and inflation that ’s about as good as we can get with the 
monetary policy tools that we have.  It doesn ’t mean we ’re satisfied.  It just means that we don’ t 
have enough fire power to get the economy back to full employment more quickly.  I don ’t know 
if that was responsive or not.   
RYAN AVENT .  I guess I’ m not —given the concerns about unconventional policy 
relative to normal interest rate policy, is there a feeling that more should be done so that when  
the next potential recession rolls around, we have more room to cut rates, or are you comfortable just using th ese threshold policies on an ongoing basis?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  I see.  So you’ re talking about the inflation target, basically.  
Is that fair?    
RYAN AVENT .  Ye s, I think so.   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Ye s, okay.  So , historically, the argument for having 
inflation greater than zero —we define price stability as 2 percent inflation , as do most central 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
20 of 26 banks around the world.  And one might ask, “Well, price stability should be zero inflation.  
Why do you choose 2 percent instead of zero? ”  And the answer  is, the question you’ re raising , 
which is that if you have zero inflation, you’ re very close to the deflation zone , and nominal 
interest rates will be so low that it would be very difficult to respond fully to recessions.  And so, 
historical experience has  suggested that 2 percent is an appropriate balance between the cost of 
inflation and the cost that you’ re referring to.  We haven ’t contemplated changing that.  We just 
put that number in, as you know, fairly recently.  I think at this point, it ’s still b eing debated in 
academic circles that —you know, and we ’ll see what kind of outcome they come up with.  But 
it’s an interesting question to try to quantify.  There is research, for example, which asks the 
question, how often do you tend to hit the zero lowe r bound?  And our belief a few years ago 
was that it was a very rare event , and now it ’s become more common.  So I ’m sure there’ ll be a 
lot of thinking about this in academic and other circles.   
BEN WEYL.   Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Ben Weyl, Congressional Quarte rly.  There’ s a lot of 
talk about whether certain institutions are too big to fail.  And I wanted to get at a different, if 
related, question.  In 1980, let ’s say , there was about —the financial sector comprised about 
5 percent of the U .S. economy, U .S. GDP ; now it ’s about 9 percent.  And I ’m wondering if you 
think that shift is beneficial to the U .S. economy?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   I don’ t think I know the answer to that question.  Certainly, 
the financial system has —I could argue two ways.  I could say, wel l, the U .S. economy grew 
pretty well between 1945 and 1975 or 1980.  And the financial system was much simpler and didn’ t have a lot of exotic derivatives and so on.  So that would be —that would be one way to 
argue that maybe, you know, all of this  extra financial activity is not justified.  On the other 
hand, the world is a lot more complicated.  We ’re a lot —the world is a lot more international.  
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
21 of 26 You have large multinational firms that are connecting resources, savers , and investors in 
different co untries.  There ’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services , and so on.  
So, I think, based on that and based on the innovations that information technology have created 
in lots of industries, you would expect financial services to be some what bigger.  So I don’ t 
really know the answer to that question.  I think that my predecessor Paul Volcker ’s claim that 
the only contribution to the financial industry is the a utomatic t eller m achine might be a little 
exaggerated.  I know that people —some  people have that view.  Again, I don’ t know the answer.  
I think that a somewhat bigger financial sector can be justified by the wider range of services and 
the more globalized financial economic system that we have.  But the exact number, I can ’t 
really say.    
JEREMY TORDJMAN.   Hi, I ’m Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP Newswire Agency.  I 
have a follow -up question on Cyprus.  As a central banker, do you think it was either appropriate 
or fair to impose a levy on every bank deposit in Cyprus , even those  insured by the European 
Union itself?  Thank you.   
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, I have not been involved in those conversations and I 
don’t necessarily know all the details , and so I know they ’re grappling with a very difficult 
problem.  I think the issue they face is that there’ s a pretty big hole, a financial hole, in the sense 
that there is a fiscal issue and there ’s also a bank restructuring recapitalization issue.  So , they ’re 
looking for resources where they can find them.  I think everyone understands that there are 
certain risks with that besides the equity issue of taxing lower -income people.  There is the issue 
of setting a pre cedent that might reduce confidence in banks in subsequent periods.  But again, 
that being said, it ’s a very tough issue.  An d I—and finding the resources to solve Cyprus ’s 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
22 of 26 problem, you know, there ’s probably no easy way to do it.  And we ’re going to keep monitoring 
that.  But I don’ t envy them that particular challenge.    
GREG ROBB.   Thank you.  There’ s been a trend in the last couple of years where the 
economy kind of jumped out of the gate in the first part of the year only to kind of falter.  Is that 
something that you’ re worried about this year?  And does that suggest that QE might have to stay 
kind of at the same pace you are now and some into the third quarter until we ’re sure about 
that—that trend?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, you’ re absolutely right that there ’s been a certain 
tendency for a spring slump that we ’ve seen a few times.  One possible explanation for that —
besides some freaky things, some weather events and so on, one possible explanation is 
seasonality.  Because of the severity of the recession in 2007 to 2009, the seasonals got distorted.  
And they may have led —and I say “ may” because the statistical experts —many of them deny it, 
but it’ s possible that they led job creation and GDP to be exaggerated to some extent early in the 
year.  Our assessment is, though, that at this point, that we ’re far enough away from the recession 
that those seasonal factors ought to be pretty much washing out by now.  So if we do , in fact , see 
a slump, it would probably be due to real fundamental causes  and then we would obviously have 
to respond to that.  As I said , we’re planning to adjust our tools to respond to changes in the 
outlook, a nd that can go either direction.   
DONALD JUDD.  Donald Judd, CBS News.  I was wondering if you could tell me how , 
if a run on the banks happens in Cyprus, how that might affect U .S. markets.  And also, is it 
possible for the U .S. to levy a tax on regular deposits here , or why not?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as someone mentioned, Cyprus is a tiny economy , 
and I don’ t think that these issues , as worrisome as they are and as concerned as we would be for 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
23 of 26 the Cypriote people , I don’ t think that they have direct implications for the U .S. economy.  The 
only way that they would create a problem would be if the runs became contagious in some 
sense, if depositors in other countries lost confidence.  But at this point, I ’m not awar e of any 
evidence that that is , in fact , the case.  The argument the Europeans are making is that Cyprus is 
a very unique situation, very different situation.  And, indeed, it is quite unusual to have a banking sector as large as they have relative to thei r economy.  In terms of the United States, you 
know, the FDIC was founded, I think, in 1934, a nd insured deposits , and they’re very proud of 
the fact that no one ’s ever lost a dime in insured deposits.  And , during the crisis, the response of 
the government was , in fact , to increase the level of, you know, depositor account sizes that were 
insured.  So I consider that to be extremely unlikely in the United States.    
DON LEE.   Don Lee at the L .A. Times .  Would you be in favor of reducing the flow of 
stimulus if we had another month or two, as we did in February , of job growth and the 
unemployment rate dropping, but the long -term unemployed didn’ t change much?  And , on a 
related question, how much of a pickup do you expect to see in the labor force participation rate, 
and what will we need to see there for that to show substantial improvement?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   On the first question, as I said, I mean that ’s a decision for 
the C ommittee.  We ’re going to have to make a judgment about how significant the improvement 
is, how sustained it is.  Long -term unemployment is one dimension of the unemployment 
problem.  But I think that probably the best way to get the long -term unemployed back to work is 
to get an overall strong labor market.  And I think that ’s—we ’d be looking at the overall key 
indicators like overall unemployment rate, payrolls and hiring, and some of the other things that I mentioned.  The other part of your question was about — 
DON LEE.   Labor force.  
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
24 of 26 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Labor force participation, yes .  Labor force participation 
has been declining on a trend- like basis in the United States for a while.  That ’s the result , 
mostly , of demographic factors , partly the aging of the population, partly the fact that female 
participation is no longer increasing —it’ s in fact decreasing a little bit.  It’s also the case that 
labor force attachment within people of working age has declined for a number of different 
reasons.  So there ’s a trend underlying this.  And , in addition, there are probably some people 
who’ve left the labor force just because they are discouraged and they can ’t find work.  So , as the 
economy strengthens, the labor market strengthens, I would expect to see some of these folks coming back into the labor force.  For example, the number of people who are out of the labor force but say they would like a full -time job but are  not actually counted as unemployed, that 
number has actually been going up, w hich suggest s that there are more people thinking about 
going back into the labor force, going back to work.  But I doubt that , in the near term at least , 
that we ’ll see an increase in labor force participation because— besides the effects of the slow 
recovery, high unemployment , we’ve had  a downward trend in the U .S., which is not due to the 
recession , it’s due to underlying demographic factors.   
CATHERINE HOLLANDER.   Catherine Hollander from National Journal .  You argued 
in a 1999 paper and a 2002 speech that monetary policy was not the right tool for addressing asset bubbles.  But in January, you suggested that there might be a role for it , even if not as the 
first line of defense.  Has your thinking on the issue evolved, and can you explain why?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Well, I still believe the following , which is that monetary 
policy is a very blunt instrument.  If you are raising interest rates to pop an asset bubble, even if 
you were sure you can do that, you might , at the same time , be throwing the  economy into 
recession , which kind of defeats the purpose of monetary policy.  And therefore, I think the first 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
25 of 26 line of defense —I mean, I think, we have a sort of a tripartite line of defense.  We start off with 
very extensive and sophisticated monitoring  at a much higher level and much more 
comprehensively than we ’ve had in the past.  Then we have supervision and regulation, where 
we work with other agencies to try to cover all the empty or uncovered areas in the financial 
system.  And then, in addition, we try to use communication and similar tools to a ffect the way 
that financial markets respond to monetary policy.  So we do have some first lines of defense , 
which I think should be used first.  That being said, you know, I think that given the problems that we’ ve had —not just in the United States, but globally in the last 15, 20 years —that we need 
to at least take into account these issues as we make monetary policy.  And I think most of the people on the FOMC would agree with that.  What that means exact ly depends on the 
circumstances.  I think if the economy is in very weak condition and interest rates are very low 
for that purpose, it ’s very difficult to contemplate raising rates a lot because you ’re concerned 
about some sector in the financial sphere.  On the other hand, if you’ re in an expansion and 
there’ s a credit boom going on, that —the case in that situation for making policy a little bit 
tighter might be better.  So , as I ’ve said many times, I have an open mind in this question.  We ’re 
learning ; all central bankers are learning.  But I think I still would agree with the point I made in 
my very first speech in 2002, as a Governor at the Federal Reserve , where I argued that the first 
line of defense ought to be the more targeted tools that we have , including regulatory tools and, 
to some extent , macroprudential tools like some emerging markets use.    
PETER COOK.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As tempted as I might be to end with your 
NCAA picks or your view of the Nationals, I have something a little more  serious for you, in line 
with what John asked you about —your future.  Given the unprecedented nature of Fed  policy on 
your watch and the uncertainty surrounding the exit strategy, to what extent do you feel 
March 20, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
26 of 26 personally responsible to be at the helm when those decisions are made, and how does that affect 
your future?  And , more specifically, sir, the last time we gathered here at the press conference, 
you were asked if you ’d spoken with the President about your future, and you said you hadn’ t at 
that time.  Could you at least tell us if you ’ve had the conversation?    
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  I’ve spoken to the President a bit, but I really don’ t have 
any—I don’ t really have any information for you at this juncture.  I don’ t think that I ’m the only 
person in the world who can manage the exit.  In fact, one of the things that I hope to 
accomplish , and was not entirely successful at , as the Governor or as the Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve, was to try to depersonalize, to some extent, monet ary policy and financial policy and to 
get broader recognition of the fact that this is an extraordinary institution.  It has a large number of very high quality policymakers.  It has a terrific staff —literally dozens of Ph.D. economists 
who’ve been working through the crisis , trying to understand these issues and implement our 
policy tools, and there ’s no single person who is essential to that.  But , again, with respect to my 
personal plans, I will certainly let you know when I have something more concrete.   
Thank you.

 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference 
June 19, 2013 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Good afternoon.   
The Federal Open Market Committee concluded a two -day meeting earlier today.  Based 
on its review of recent economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the economy 
continuing to grow at a moderate pace, notwithstanding the strong headwinds created by current 
federal fiscal policies.  
The labor market has continued to improve, with gains in private payroll employment 
averaging about 200,000 jobs per month over the past six months.  Job gains, along with the 
strengthening housing market, have in turn contributed to increases in consumer confidence and 
supported household spending.  However, at 7.6 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated, as do rates of underemployment and long -term unemployment.  Overall, the Committee 
believes the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market have diminished since the fall, but we will continue to evaluate economic conditions and risks as they evolve.  
Inflation has been running below the Committee ’s longer -run objective of 2 percent for 
some time and has been a bit softer recently.  The Committee believes that the recent softness partly reflects transitory factors , and with longer -term inflation expectations remaining stable, 
the Committee expects inflation to move back towards  this 2 percent longer -term objective over 
time.  We will, however, be closely monitori ng these developments as well.  
In conjunction with this meeting, the 19 participants in our policy discussion—the 
7 Board members and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted individual economic 
projections.  As always, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of 
appropriate monetary policy.  Generally, the projections of individual participants show they expect moderate growth, picking up over time, and gradual progress towards  levels of 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
2 of 28  
 unemployment and infl ation consistent with the Federal Reserve ’s statutory mandate to foster 
maximum employment and price stability.   
In brief , participants ’ projections for economic growth have a central tendency of 2.3 to 
2.6 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.6 percent i n 2015.  The central tendency of their 
projections of the unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of this year is 7.2 to 7.3 percent, 
declining to 5.8 to 6.2 percent in the final quarter of 2015.  Most participants see inflation gradually increasing from its current low level toward the Committee ’s longer -run objective; the 
central tendency of their projections for inflation is 0.8 to 1.2 perce nt for this year and 1.6 to 
2.0 percent for 2015.   
Before turning to today ’s policy decision, let me say a few wo rds about the Federal 
Reserve’ s strategy for normalizing policy in the long run .  In the minutes of its June 2011 
meeting, the Committee set forth principles that it intended to follow when the time came to normalize policy and the size and the structure of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet .  As part of 
prudent planning, we have been reviewing these principles in recent meetings .  We expect those 
discussions to continue and intend to provide further information at an appropriate time .  For 
today, I will n ote that, in the view of most participants, the broad principles set out in June 2011 
remain applicable.  One difference is worth mentioning .  While participants continue to think 
that, in the long run, the Federal Reserve ’s portfolio should consist predom inantly of Treasury 
securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage -
backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy, although in the longer run, limited sales could be used to reduce or elimina te residual MBS holdings .  I emphasize that, 
given the outlook and the Committee ’s policy guidance, these matters are unlikely to be relevant 
to actual policy for quite a while .   
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
3 of 28  
 Let me turn now to current policy issues .  With unemployment still elevated and inflation 
below the Committee ’s longer -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly 
accommodative policies .  As you know, in normal times, the Committee eases monetary policy 
by lowering the target for the short -term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.  However, the 
target range for the federal funds rate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot meaningfully be 
reduced further .  Thus, we are providing policy accommodation through two alternative 
methods :  first, by communicating to the public the Committee ’s plans for setting the federal 
funds rate target over the medium term, and , second , by purchasing and holding Treasury 
securities and agency mortgage -backed securities .  Let me discuss a few key points regarding 
each of these two policy  tools .   
First, today the Committee reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low 
range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved in the 
senses described in the FOMC statement .  As I have noted frequently, the phrase “ at least as 
long” in the Committee ’s interest rate guidance is important.  T he economic conditions we have 
set out as preceding any future rate i ncrease are thresholds, not triggers .  For example, assuming 
that inflation is near our objective at that time, as expected, a decline in the unemployment rate to 6½ percent would not lead automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but rather would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase .  All else equal, the more subdued the 
outlook for inflation at that time, the more patient the Committee would  likely be in making that 
assessment .  In the projections submitted for this meeting, 14 of 19 FOMC participants indicated 
that they expect the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate to occur in 2015, and one 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
4 of 28  
 expected the first increase to  incur in 2016.  Moreover, so long as the economy remains short of 
maximum employment, inflation remains near our longer -run objective, and inflation 
expectations remain well  anchored, increases in the target for the federal funds rate, once they 
begin, ar e likely to be gradual, consistent with the Committee ’s balanced approach to meeting its 
employment and price stability objectives .   
The purpose of this forward guidance about policy is to assure households and businesses 
that monetary policy will continu e to support the recovery even as the pace of economic growth 
and job creation picks up.  Importantly, as our statement notes, the Committee expects a 
considerable interval of time to pass between when the Committee will cease adding 
accommodation through asset purchases and the time when the Committee will begin to reduce 
accommodation by moving the federal funds rate target toward more normal levels .   
The second policy tool being employed by the Committee is asset purchases .  
Specifically, the Committee has been purchasing $40 billion per month in agency mortgage -
backed securities and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities .  When our program of asset 
purchases was initiated last September, the Committee stated the goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the  context of price stability and noted it 
would also be taking appropriate account of the efficacy and costs of the program .  Today the 
Committee made no changes to the purchase program .   
Although the Comm ittee left the pace of purchases unchanged at today ’s meeting, it has 
stated that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve .  Any such change 
would reflect the incoming data and their implications for the outlook, as well as the cumul ative 
progress made toward the Committee ’s objectives since the program began in September .  Going 
forward, the economic outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely involve continuing gains 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
5 of 28  
 in labor markets, supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as 
the near -term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes .  We also see inflation 
moving back toward our 2 percent objective over time .  If the incoming data are broadly 
consistent with this forecast, the Co mmittee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to 
moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year .  And if the subsequent data remain 
broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear .  In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment 
rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced this program .   
I would like to emphasize once more the point that our policy is in no way predetermined 
and will  depend on the incoming data and the evolution of the outlook as well as on the 
cumulative progress toward our objectives .  If conditions improve faster than expected, the pace 
of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly .  If the outlook becomes less 
favorable, on the other hand, or if financial conditions are judged to be inconsistent with further progress in the labor markets, reductions in the pace of purchases could be delayed.  Indeed, 
should it be needed, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability .   
It’s also worth noting here that, even if a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases 
occurs, we would not be shrinking the Federal Reserve ’s portfolio of securities , but only slowing 
the pace at which we are adding to the portfolio while continuing to reinvest principal payments 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
6 of 28  
 and proceeds from maturing holdings as well .  These large and  growing holdings will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer -term interest rates .  To use the analogy of driving an 
automobile, any slowing in the pace of purchases will be akin to letting up a bit on the gas pedal 
as the car picks up speed, not to beginning to apply the brakes .   
I will close by drawing again the important distinction between the Committee ’s 
decisions about adjusting the pace of asset purchases and its forward guidance regarding the target for the federal funds rate.  As I mentioned, the current level of the federal funds rate target 
is likely to remain appropriate for a considerable period after asset purchases are concluded .  To 
return to the driving analogy, if the incoming data support the view that the economy is able to sustain a reasonable cruising speed, we will ease the pressure on the accelerator by gradually reducing the pace of purchases .  However, any need to consider applying the brakes by raising 
short -term rates is still far in the future .  In any case, no matter how conditions may evolve, the 
Federal Reserve remains committed to fostering substantial improvement in the outlook for the 
labor market in a context of price stability.  
Thank you.  I’d be glad to take your questions .   
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman with CNBC .  I hate to use my question to ask you to 
clarify something, but when you said gradually reduce purchases, beginning later this year and ending it next year when the unemployment rate hits  7 percent —what is that?  Is that a decision 
by the FOMC?  Is that an  intention that — 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  That is —we had a good discussion of that issue today , and 
we haven ’t had —obviously , there’ s no change, there’ s no change in policy involved here, there ’s 
simply a clarification, helping people to think about where polic y will evolve .  So, it was thought 
that it might be best for me to explain that to this group and answer questions .  Future policy 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
7 of 28  
 statements may include elements of this , but it ’s not a policy change .  I’m just trying to explain 
how are —how we ’re making a  substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market , how 
we’re making that concrete , and how we ’re thinking about the potential future of the program 
given alternative policy and economic developments. 
STEVE LIESMAN .  So there is no consensus on t hat?  That ’s not a vote of the FOMC, 
that’s not a plan that ’s written down some place or —? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  It represents the consensus of the FOMC, yes. 
STEVE LIESMAN .  If you could just —the question I was going to ask was , could you 
give us some infor mation on “ substantial improvement ”?  Is that the unemployment rate coming 
down by itself to 7 percent , or are there other factors involved, and is it “ substantial ” compared 
to the fall?  Is that when — 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, there  are many factors that we look at when t rying to 
judge the state of the labor market .  As you know, we look at participation, payrolls, a variety of 
other data , but the 7 percent unemployment rate is indicative of the kind of progress we ’d like to 
make in order to be able to say  that we ’ve reach ed substantial progress.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr . Chairman, 
there’ s an undercurrent of optimism in your forecast and your statement —in the policy statement 
today .  For instance, the unemployment rate forecast comes down to 6.5 to 6.8 percent next year .  
It’s the case that the Fed has overestimated the economy ’s growth rate very often in the past 
during this recovery, so —and we ’ve gone through a period in the first half of the year with pretty 
subdued growth.  So I would like to hear you explain where this optimism comes from and how 
confident you are that these expectations are going to be met. 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
8 of 28  
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, the fundamentals look a little better to us .  In 
particular, the housing sector, which has been a drag on growth since the crisis , is now, 
obviously, a support to growth.  It’s not only creating construction jobs, but as house prices rise, 
increased household wealth supports consumption spending, consumer sentiment .  State and 
local governments , who have been a major drag , are now coming to a position where they no 
longer have to lay off large numbers of workers .  Generally speaking, financial conditions are 
improving .  The main drag , or the main headwind , to growth this year is , as you know, is the 
federal fiscal policy, which the CBO estimates is something on the order of 1 ½ percentage points 
of growth.  And our judgment is that, you know, given that very heavy headwind, the fact that 
the economy is still moving ahead at at least a  moderate pace, is indicative that the underlying 
factors are improving .  And so we ’ll see how that evolves .  Obviously, we haven’ t seen the full 
effect yet of the fiscal policy changes ; we’ll  want to see how that evolves as we get through that 
fiscal impact .  But we ’re hopeful, as you can see from the individual projections —and again, 
these are individual projections, not an official forecast of the C ommittee —we ’ll be obviously 
very interested to see if the economy does pick up a bit and continue to reduce unemployment, as we anticipate.  I think one thing that ’s very important for me to say is that, if you draw the 
conclusion that I ’ve just said , that our policies —that our purchases will end in the middle of next 
year, you ’ve drawn the wrong conclus ion because our purchases are tied to what happens in the 
economy .  And if the Federal Reserve makes the same error and we overestimate what ’s 
happening, then our policies will adjust to that .  We are not —we have no deterministic or fixed 
plan.  Rather, our policies are going to depend on this scenario coming true .  If it doesn’ t come 
true, we ’ll adjust our policies to that.

 ALISTER BULL .  Alister Bull from Reuters .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financial 
conditions have tightened in the last few weeks and bond yields have gone up, and they ’ve gone 
up again today .  Why do you think that is?  And could you talk a little bit about whether that rise 
in bond yields and interest —longer -term interest rates could affect your economic outlook and, 
particularly , given that  mortgage rates are  now back up above  4 percent , if that could affect the 
recovery under  way in the  housing market?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, that ’s a good question.  Yes, rates have come up 
some .  That ’s in part due to more optimism , I think , about the economy .  It’s  in part due to 
perceptions of the Federal Reserve.  The forecast —the projections that our participants submitted 
for this meeting , of course , were done in the last few days , so they were done with full 
knowledge of what had happened to financial conditions .  Rates have tightened some, but, you 
know, other factors ha ve been more positive —increasing house prices , for example .  I think as 
far as the housing market is concerned, we ’re going to want to watch that , but one important 
difference now is that people are more optimistic about housing .  They expect house prices to 
continue to rise , and we see that , for example, in a survey question in the Michigan survey .  And 
that, you know, compensates to some extent for a slightly higher mortgage rate .  And , in fact, in 
terms of monthly payments on an average house, the change in mortgage rates we ’ve seen so far 
is not all that dramatic .  So, yes, our forecast —our projections do factor that in, and if interest 
rates go up for the right rea sons—that is , both optimism about the economy and an accurate 
assessment of monetary policy —that ’s a good thing .  That ’s not a bad thing.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, you ’ve 
always argued that it ’s the stock of ass ets that the Federal Reserve holds which affects long -term 
interest rates .  How do you reconcile that with a very sharp rise in real interest rates that we’ ve 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
10 of 28  
 seen in recent weeks?  And do you think the market is correctly interpreting what you think is 
most likely to be the future path of the  Federal Reserve’ s stock of assets?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, we were a little puzzled by that.  It was bigger than 
can be explained I think by changes in the ultimate stock of asset purchases within reasonable 
ranges .  So I think we have to conclude that there are other factors at work as well , including , 
again, some optimism about the economy, maybe some uncertainty arising .  So, I ’m agreeing 
with you that it seems larger than can be explained by a changing view of monetary policy .   
It’s difficult to judge whether the markets are in sync or not .  Generally speaking though, 
I think that what I ’ve seen from analyst s and market participants is not wildly different from 
what, you know, the C ommittee is thinking and trying to—as I try today  to communicate .  I think 
the most important thing that I just want to convey , again , is that it’ s important not to say “ this 
date, that date, this time, ” it’s important to understand that our policies are economic dependent 
and, in particular , if financial conditions move in a way that make this economic scenario 
unlikely , for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy .   
YLAN MUI .  Thanks .  Ylan Mui, Washington Post .  On Monday, President Obama said 
in an interview that he believe d that you had stayed in your position as chairman for longer than 
you wanted to and maybe longer than you were supposed to.  Do you agree with that assessment of your term , and can you update us on any conversations you’ ve had with him about your 
future?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, Ylan, we just spent two days working on monetary 
policy issues , and I would like to keep the debate, discussion, the  questions here on policy .  I 
don’t have anything for you on my personal plans . 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
11 of 28  
 CRAIG TORRES .  Greetings , Mr. Chairman .  Craig Torres from Bloomberg .  I’d like to 
push for a little deeper explanation on thresholds and triggers.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Sure.  
CRAIG TORRES .  The forecast and the mysterious dots kind of don’ t map into the 
unemployment forecast .  We see more -gradual rate rise going out into  time .  People moving to 
the right, at least one person, on when  they expect the rate to increase, and yet, unemployment ’s 
going to fall to  6.5 percent in 2014.  I also note that labor force participation isn ’t in that great 
shape, and you, in fact , have been a big believer that a lot of the exit from the workforce is 
related to weak demand, not structural factors .  So here is my question.  Can you explain a little 
bit more —you know —mayb e is the threshold too high?  And I ’ll point out that the V ice C hair 
and two other people who used to work here have done significant research on, maybe you need 
to let the employment rate fall much lower to pull these people back into the labor force .  So I’m 
wondering  if you can expand on that . 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, it’ s a great question and —but the —what you pointed 
out, the difference between the little dots and the forecast actually illustrates the point, which is , 
remember, the 6½ percent is a threshold, not a trigger .  In other words, when we get to that point, 
we will then at that point begin to, you know, look at whether an increase in rates is appropriate , 
and among the things we would take into account , first of all , is inflation, and infla tion obviously 
is very low and expected to stay low .  Secondly, we would be taking into account , does that 
unemployment rate fairly represent in some sense the state of the labor market ?  And, as you 
pointed out, we have underemployment , part -time work, pe ople leaving the labor force, reduced 
participation, long- term unemployment, a number of factors which suggest that maybe th e 
6.5 percent is a little bit—not exactly representative of the state of the labor market at that point .  
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
12 of 28  
 So, first of all, since it is a threshold and not a trigger, we ’re entirely free to take all that into 
account before we begin the process of raising rates , and that ’s what the diagram suggests .  
People are saying that unemployment will be at 6.5 in late 2014 or  early 2015, but the y’re saying 
that increases  in rates may not follow but several quarters after that .  In terms of adjusting the 
threshold, I think that ’s something that might happen .  If it did happen, it would be to lower it, 
I’m sure , not to raise it.  
BINYAMIN APPE LBAUM .  Bin ya Appelbaum, New York Times .  Following up on that, 
so I understand the 6.5 percent is a threshold, but you’ ve just talked about a 7 percent line for 
asset purchases .  That sounded less like a threshold than  like a target .  You said if you ’re at about 
that level , you’ll stop with the asset purchases mid  next year .  You talked about wanting to see 
substantial improvement in the labor market before you did suspend those purchases .  It’s very 
easy to imagine a  situation in which we get to 7 percent w ithout seeing labor force participation 
increase.  The employment rate ’s been at the same level for three years now .  Has something 
changed in your thinking about the value of asset purchases?  W hy are you  cutting them off 
before you see that “ substantial improvement ”? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, “ substantial ” is in the eye of the beholder .  I think 
going from 8.1 percent and a stagnant rate of improvement to 7 percent and stronger economic 
growth is a substantial increase.  I think it ’s important to explain that, you know, we view 
ourselves as  having two tools .  One of them is rate policy , and that includes both setting the rate 
and providing guidance about future rates .  That ’s our basic tool, that ’s the one that the Federal 
Reserve and other central banks h ave used forever .  Asset purchases are a different kind of thing .  
They ’re unconventional policy, they come with certain risks and certain uncertainties that are not 
necessarily associated with rate policy .  So our intent from the beginning , as I’ve been very clear , 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
13 of 28  
 was to use asset purchases as a way of achieving some near -term momentum to get the economy 
moving forward into a sustainable recovery .  And then, essentially , to allow the low interest rate 
policy which—to carry us through.  So what I —so let me  just make two, I think, very important 
points .  The first is, our target is not 7, it ’s not 6½, our target is maximum employment, which , 
according to our projections , most people on the C ommittee think is somewhere between 5 and 
6 percent unemployment , and that ’s where we’ re trying to get to .  The 7, the 6½—these are 
guide posts  that tell you how we ’re going to be shifting the mix of our tools as we try to land th is 
ship on a, you know, on a —in a smooth way onto the aircraft carrier .  The —sorry.  So, the other 
thing I wanted to say was that stopping asset purchases, when that happens , and I think we ’re 
still some distance from that happening , but when that happens, that won’ t involve ending the 
stimulus from asset purchases because we’ re going to hold on t o that portfolio.  And if the  stock 
theory of the portfolio is correct , which we believe it is, holding all of  those securities off of the 
market and reinvesting and still keeping the , you know, rolling -over maturing securities, w ill still 
continue to put downward  pressure on interest rates .  And so, between our commitments to a low 
federal funds rate and  the large portfolio, we will still be producing a very large amount of 
stimulus —in our view , enough to bring the economy smoothly towards full employment without 
incurring unnecessary costs or risks. 
VICTORIA McGRANE .  Hi, Chairman.  Victoria McGrane with Dow Jones Newswires .  
You, in your statement be fore the press conference and in the policy statement, acknowledge that 
inflation readings have been low .  But you maintain that inflation expect—longer -term inflation 
expectations have remained stable.  But actually, certain bond market measures of these things 
have fallen in recent weeks .  Is that of any concern , and if not, why?  What would you need to 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
14 of 28  
 see for the C ommittee to start being more concerned that longer -term inflation expectations are , 
in fact, falling?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, this is something we watch very carefully .  There are 
a number of, as I mentioned in th e statement, there are a num ber of transitory factors that may be 
contributing to the very low inflation rate .  For example, the effects of the sequester on medical 
payments, the fact that nonmarket prices are extraordinarily low right now .  So these are some 
things that we expect to  reverse and we expect to see inflation come up a bit .  But, first, on 
inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation -adjusted —inflation -
index ed bonds have come down.  To this point, they still remain within the historical range that 
we’ve seen over the past few years .  And moreover, other measures of inflation expectations , be 
it forecast s by professional forecasters, whether it ’s survey measures from firms or households, 
those are all still pretty much in the same places they we re.   
Now that being said, and as I said in my opening remarks, we don ’t take anything for 
granted .  And one of the preconditions for the policy path that I described is that inflation begin , 
at least gradually , to return towards our 2 percent objective .  If that doesn ’t happen, we will 
obviously have to take some measures to address that .  And we are certainly determined to keep 
inflation not only —we want to keep inflation near its objective , not only avoiding inflation that ’s 
too high, but we also want to avoid inflation that ’s too low. 
PETER COOK .  Mr. Chairman, Peter Cook with Bloomberg Television.  Given the 
volatility we ’ve seen in the market since your comments of May 22nd, the lengths to which you 
are stressing the forward guidance here today, it doe s suggest that there are some out there 
you’re worried are not getting your message right now .  And I ’m wondering, to what extent do 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
15 of 28  
 you think now that your exit strategy is going to be that much more challengin g because even in 
this small period of time w hen you haven ’t done all that much, you’ ve seen this kind of reaction?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, it is important for us to communicate .  It’s 
particularly important when we have an unusual economic situation where I think the standard 
relationships are not  applying in the way they have , where we ’re using unconventional tools, 
where we’ re using forward guidance .  So, I guess I agree with you that our communication is 
going to be very important .  We hope that the —again, the key point I ’ve tried to make today is 
that our policies are tied to how the outlook evolves .  And that should provide some comfort to 
markets because they will understand, I hope, that we will be providing whatever support is necessary .  If the economy does not improve along the lines that we expect, we’ ll provide 
additional support .  If financial conditions evolve in a way that ’s inconsistent with economic 
recovery, we will provide support .  But we ’re hope —and in that way, we hope to increase 
confidence both among market participants , but also among investors and private consumers and 
other people in the economy .  So, but again, I mean, your point is well  taken that we are in a 
position where the simple adjustment by 25 bas is points to the federal funds rate seems like a 
long-ago exper ience, and we are in a more complex type of situation .  But we are determined to 
be as clear as we can , and we hope that you and your listeners and the markets will all be able to 
follow what we ’re saying.  
DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with American Banker .  Next month will be the three -
year anniversary of the Dodd–Frank Act , and , as you know, there are a number of significant 
rulemakings that have left to be finalized :  the Volcker r ule, prudential  regulations under s ection 
165 and 166, and risk retention, to name a few .  Can you provide us with an update on where we 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
16 of 28  
 stand with the rulemakings?  And also, are you still optimistic that we will see these rules 
completed by the end of this year?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  It’s certainly true that it’ s taken time to do these 
regulations .  There are a number of reasons for that .  The first is that the y are, inherently , many 
of them, quite complicated .  The Volcker r ule, for example, involves some very subtle 
distinctions between hedging and market ma king and proprietary trading .  The second reason is 
that many of them involve multiple agencies , which have to coordinate, cooperate , and agree on 
language .  I think the QRM rule is , six agencies are  involved in making that rule .  And the third 
fact—the th ird and basic issue is that we really have to do our homework.  We have to get these 
right , and that means having extended comment periods, getting lots of information from the 
public .  And then, you know, reviewing those comments and doing all we can to m ake sure 
we’re responsive to those many, many concerns and suggestions .  So it does take time .  I think 
it’s a little unfair to say, “Well, only 30 percent of the rules have been completed,”  because most 
of the rules , even if they haven ’t been completed , are now very far advanced , and that ’s true for 
the major rules .  We are very close, for example, to completing Basel III .  We have made a good 
bit of progress on the Volcker r ule, and I do anticipate that being done this year .  We are making 
additional pr ogress on our 165, 166 advisory rules on the capital surcharges .  These are all things 
that will be coming relatively soon, at least during, you know, the current year .  And of course, 
once they are out there, then it will still take some time to be implemented , for financial 
institutions to change their practices , and so on—and so on.  I would also emphasize , though, 
that, even as this is going on, that we are not ignoring the health and safety of the banking 
system .  For example, I mean, since 2009, we ’ve been doing these very rigorous stress test s, 
which are part of the Dodd –Frank rules .  And the amount of capital that U .S. banks hold has 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
17 of 28  
 roughly doubled—the largest banks —since 2009.  And indeed, the largest banks now appear , 
most of them , either to be Basel III –compliant or pretty close to Basel III –compliant .  So we are 
working with the banks to ensure their safety, to help them move in the directions that they know 
they’re going to have to be going even as the rules themselves are being finalized .  So, it’ s an 
ongoing process , but I expect to see, you know, more -rapid completion, you know, going 
forward in the next few quarters.  
PETER BARNES .  Peter Barnes, Fox Business .  Sir, one of the highlights of the Kansas 
City Fed conference in Jackson Hole every year are remarks by the Chairman, you .  You’re  not 
going this year .  We ’ve heard it ’s because you have a conflict in your personal schedule .  But 
some have read —taken that as a sign that you may not be staying on the job for another term .  
Could you comment on that?  And could you offer us —give us a little more explanation as to 
why you ’re not going to be in Jackson Hole for the first time?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as I ’ve said, I ’m not going to comment on my 
personal plans , but I will say this .  I think t here’ s a perception that the Jackson Hole conference 
is a F ederal R eserve S ystemwide conference.  It’s not .  It’s a conference sponsored by one of the 
12 R eserve Banks.  Every one of the 12 R eserve Banks has conferences, has meetings, and this is 
the one I ’ve gone to the most of probably any of the R eserve Banks, so I think it ’s not 
inappropriate to go to different conferences, different meetings , and to essentially meet all the 
constituents that I have in these different R eserve Banks.  So that ’s one reaso n, certainly.  
STEVE BECKNER .  Steve Beckner of MNI, Mr. Chairman.  A number of your 
colleagues , as reflected in the new SEP  projections , expect the unemployment rate to get down to 
6½ percent next year , which is your threshold for considering raising the f unds rate .  And yet the 
FOMC has also said that it expects to keep rates very accommodative for a considerable time 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
18 of 28  
 after asset purchases and after the recovery has strengthened .  And yet here we are, the middle of 
2013, you’ ve not even begun to scale back asset purchases .  So, I mean, you’ve  partially 
address ed this.  But, you know, could there be a conflict between, on the one hand, the asset 
purchase program, on the other hand, the funds rate guidance policy .  Could they conflict?  
Could you perhaps elaborate?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I certainly hope the unemployment rate comes down 
so fast  that this becomes a problem .  I guess I would point out a couple of things .  One is that , of 
course, you know, there ’s a range of estimates , and they ’re all based on each individual ’s idea of 
optimal policy , so the policy assumptions may not be the same .  So it ’s true that some are as low 
as 6.5, but as I said in my earlier answer, that ’s a threshold, not a trigger .  So, evidently , if you, 
you know, look at the policy expectations that are given in the dot diagram, you’ ll see that the 
very strong majority of FOMC participants still expect rates to be quite low at the end of 2015.  
So that ’s not inconsistent, that ’s just saying that people are looking at a variety o f factors , 
including inflation , which is predicted to be quite low, and other perhaps labor market factors in  
thinking about when it ’ll be appropriate to start increasing rates.  
SCOTT SPOERRY .  Thank you, Sir .  Scott Spoerry from CNN, CNNMoney .  Well, first 
of all, I should tell you that your analogy to landing the economy on an aircraft carrier worried me a little bit because , from personal experience, I find that it ’s always a little bit jarring to land 
on an aircraft carrier .  But I wanted to talk ab out mortgage -backed securities .  You mentioned 
during your comments here that , if I understood correctly, that you’ re not going to dispose of the 
mortgage -backed securities that you have on the book during this period of normalization.  A nd 
I’ve heard many  people on Wall Street and elsewhere say that right now the Federal Reserve is  
the market for mortgage -backed securities , and so —which means that it’ s kind of a warped 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
19 of 28  
 market right now .  And I’m just wondering , how focused are you on mortgage -backed securi ties 
and this larger world market , which —what used to  be a world market for mortgage -backed 
securities .  And I guess —I guess what I ’m saying, has the ground shifted from under us in terms 
of the mortgage -backed security world on a permanent basis , or at le ast for a very long -term 
basis , because of the devastating nature of what happened a few years ago? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, we are still only a fraction of the total holdings of 
mortgage -backed securities , but, more relevant , as part of our assessment —of our ongoing 
assessment of the potential cost s of our various  asset purchase programs , we pay very close 
attention to market functioning .  And our assessment is that the MBS market is still quite a 
healthy market in terms of the spreads, in terms of execut ion times, in terms of the number of 
people on both sides of the market .  You know, there are REITs  now that are building up their 
MBS portfolios .  The re are plenty of real -money investors holding MBS .  So, you know, if the 
market was really breaking down in some way that would be a fact or we’d have to take into 
account .  But our assessment —and , of course , we’re in that market quite a bit, s o we have a lot 
of information about it —our assessment is that that market is still working quite well, and that 
our purchases are not disrupting the normal price discovery and liquidity functions of that 
market .  I think that the events of five years ago, obviously , do have a big long -term effect .  
There are bills in Congress that would change , reform the GSEs , for example, and ultimately 
would change the market for mortgage -backed securities, perhaps increasing the amount of 
private placements or changing the whole institutional structure of that market.  So, we may end up holding some securities , which are in some sense left over from a previous era at some point .  
But nevertheless, you know, for the time being, they are the mortgage -backed securit ies 
market — Fannie and Freddie are basically it —and we are, of course , legally allowed to buy and 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
20 of 28  
 own those securit ies.  And so, we have found it useful to do that , and we believe it ’s contributed 
to lower mortgage rates and a stronger housing market .  So that ’s been our rationale .  And just , 
again, to come back to your question, we do not see any significant deteriora tion in market 
functioning .  If there are things that you can point us to, we would be  obviously  very interested.  
SCOTT SPOERRY.   Well, let me just follow up with just one thing .  In terms of the 
government backing through the GSEs of mortgage -backed secur ities, is there a concern, a 
legitimate concern that without government backing of this market in some way , that because the 
private market is —seems to move with much more rapidity than government backing and 
government purchases, that moving the government out of this backup role on mortgage -backed 
securities would be a real problem or really change the nature of getting a mortgage in America.  
Some people say, you know, if the government wasn’ t behind it, it would mean the end of the 
30-year mort gage as we know it. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, these issues are being debated .  There are some— a 
number of bills in Congress which would change the GSEs, would eliminate them in some cases , 
or would place them with backstop government support, as  opposed to 100 percent government 
credit guarantees .  So these are debates that we’ re all having about the future  of the U .S. 
mortgage market .  I think it ’s entirely possible that if there ’s major change in the government ’s 
role in the mortgage market that we might see a different structure in mortgages .  And, you 
know, other countries have different structures , and they have , in many cases , the same or similar 
home ownership rates as we do, s o it’s possible that we may find that a different structure is 
better for s ome people .   
GREG ROBB .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com .  I was 
wondering if you could go back over your —what you said about the plans for tapering later this 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
21 of 28  
 year.  And why isn ’t tapering a tightening?   It seems that many people in the markets just as soon 
as you talk taper —will taper —are just going to push forward when you—they think that first rate 
hike will come .  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as I tr ied to explain in my opening remarks, our pla ns 
depend on the economic scenario and how it evolves .  And what I tr ied to do is explain how our 
asset purchases would evolve if , sort of , the modal, the most likely forecast , were to , in fact , take 
place, which , of cou rse, it won ’t exactly take place, s omething else will no doubt  happen.  But 
again, our basic forecast is one which is basically , as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a 
moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks  up as we pass through this period of fiscal 
restraint; where un employment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last 
September —and we have made som e progress since last September ; and inflation rises slowly 
towards 2 percent .  Those are the conditions that define this sort of baseline forecast .  In that case 
then, as I described it, we would expect probably to slow or moderate purchases some time later 
this year, and then through the middle of —through  the early part of next year , and ending , in that 
scenario , somewhere in  the middle of the year .  Aga in though, it ’s very important to understand 
that that’ s—if we do that, that would basically say that , you know , that we ’ve had a relatively 
decent economic outcome in terms of sustained improvement in growth and unemployment .  If 
things are worse, we would do more .  If things are better, we will do less .   
I think I would—to answer your other question— I would draw the analogy:  If the 
Federal Reserve in normal times lowers the federal funds rate by 25 basis points , but some 
traders think that —were  expecting 50 basis points, then there might be a sense that the financial 
conditions have tightened somewhat .  But nevertheless, I think you would say that if the Fed cut 
the funds rate by 25 basis points , that that was an easing of policy .  And, by the same t oken, as 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
22 of 28  
 long as we ’re buying assets , we are adding to our holdings .  We do believe —although, you 
know, there ’s room for debate —we do believe that the primary effect of our purchases is through 
the stock that we hold, because that stock has been withdrawn from markets , and the prices of 
those assets have to adju st to balance supply and demand.  A nd we ’ve taken out some of the 
supply , and so the prices go up, the yields go down.  So, that , seems to me , consistent with the 
idea that we’ re still adding liquidity , we’re still adding accommodation to the system.  
RYAN AVENT .  Ryan Avent, The Economist . 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Hi.  
RYAN AVENT .  Mr. Chairman, I ’m trying to sort of understand the view with rela tion to 
these inflation  figures .  I’m a little surprised at how , I guess , blasé the C ommittee seems about 
them , with the exception of President Bullard.  Inflation looks remarkably low on both core and 
headline, PCE  and CPI .  Your projections have it at —rising , the core PC E rising , to at most 
2 percent in 2015.  You say that inflation expectations have remained sort of within the range 
that the Fed has  traditionally  been comfortable with , but they have fallen by a good ½ percentage 
point .  And , as y ou know , that when interest rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, a decline in 
inflation expectations sort of  translates into an increase in real rates .  Why is the Fed not more 
concerned about this?  It seem s to me that earlier in the  recovery, they were more concerned 
about declines in  inflation like this .  And wouldn’ t you say that , even if you ’re happy with the 
pace of labor market recovery, th at, other things equal, this sort of inflation performance 
suggest s that you should be pushing harder on the acceler ator. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  I don’ t disagree with anything you said .  I think low —
inflation that’ s too low is a problem .  It increases the risk of deflation .  It raises real interest rates .  
It means that debt de leveraging takes place more slowly .  Now, there ’s always issues about, you 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
23 of 28  
 know, why is it low?   And , as I pointed out, there are a few reasons that are probably not that 
meaningful economically —for example, the temporary movement in medical prices, the 
temporary movements in nonmarket prices, thi ngs of that sort .  I mean, after all , the CPI is 
somewhat higher .  And so we expect inflation to come back up, that ’s our forecast .  But I don’ t 
want —I think it ’s entirely wrong to say we ’re not concerned about it .  We are concerned about 
it.  W e would like to get inflation up to our target , and that will be a factor in our thinking about 
the thresholds .  It will be a factor in our thinking about asset purchases .  And, you know, we ’ve 
got a dual mandate, and it ’s maximum employment and price stability .  And there’ s a reason why 
we define price stability as a positive inflation rate, not zero, because we believe that in order to 
best maximize the mandate, we need to have enough inflation so that there is , in fact, you know, 
some room for real interest rates to move .  So, I don’ t disagree with your basic argument .   
KEVIN HALL .  Thanks, Mr. Chairman, Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers .  Since 
you’ve referred to Mr. Hilsenrath, is he the real power behind the throne?  That’s one of the 
questions we all have .   
You had mentioned on several occasions now that quantitative easing is designed to kind 
of spur economic —drive down the yields , force more risk -taking that flows through the 
economy .  There had been debate a couple of years ago at the beg inning of this about whether it 
was inflating commodity prices .  Inflation as a whole is subdued, but oil prices are —anchor ed 
somewhere around $99—$93 to $99.  We were told on ce we have domestic production —we 
have record production now —that th at would be a signal to bring prices down.  It hasn ’t 
happened.  Brazil has got people on the streets be cause of inflation.  To what degree do you think 
quantitative easing is actually inflating commodity prices , and have you been able to filter that 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
24 of 28  
 out?  And any thoughts on wage grow th and why that ’s been so flat when everything else seems 
to be doing good in the economy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, when we —as I recall, I believe I have this right —
when we introduced the second round of LSAPs , properly known as QE2, in , I think, November 
2010, there was a lot of increase in commodity prices at that time , and there was a lot of 
complaining that the Fed is pumping up commodity prices , and that that ’s a negative for people 
around the world.  And we argued at the time that the effect s of the Federal Reserve’ s policy on 
global commodity prices was probably pr etty small , and that it operated —to the extent it did 
have an effect —it operated through growth—mos tly through growth expectations .  That is , a 
stronger global economy tends to dri ve up commodity prices .   
This time around, we ’ve purchased , and are in the process of purchasi ng, a lot more than 
we did in so- called QE2 .  We haven ’t really seen much increase in commodity prices .  
Commodity prices are way off their peaks of early last year.  Oil is a little bit different from 
others in  that it ’s kind of hung up.  But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the 
reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets —China, the rest of Asia , and some 
other parts of the worl d—plus Europe , of course , are softer , and so global commodity demand is 
weaker .  And that explains , I think, the bulk of why commodity prices have not risen so much.  
So I think that ’s all consistent with our story that the effect of asset purchases on com modity 
prices —I’m not saying it’s  zero, but I don ’t think that it’ s nearly as bi g as some folks have 
suggested.  
In terms of wages, I think that ’s mostly consistent with our view that unemployment , at 
7.6 percent , is still pretty far from where we should be satisfied .  Maximum employment, we 
think, is , again , between 5 and 6 percent , although these are very difficult numbers to estimate .  
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
25 of 28  
 So, very weak wage growth, except in a few places and a few narrow occupation s, is indicative 
to me of a  labor market that remains quite slack and where, you know, that justifies , I think—
together with low inflation —justifies why we are maintaining a highly accommodative  policy.  
KATE DAVIDSON.  Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from Politico .  The S EC’s money 
market fund proposal is far less comprehensive than the plan that you and the Financial Stability 
Oversight C ouncil endorsed.  Do you think FSOC should defer to the S EC or still press for more 
to be done?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I ’m very glad to see that the S EC has taken up money 
market reform .  It is by far the best outcome for the S EC to do it .  It’s the area where they have 
the expertise and where they have the experience.  In terms of their actual proposal they ’ve put 
out—of course , it’s just a proposal for comment —one of their two proposals, the floating NAV, 
the floating net  asset value, is , of course , qualitatively similar to that —one of the proposals that 
was in the FSOC suggestions .  We have not yet reviewed this in enough detail to give a view .  
But I hope that —I think —I know for sure that by putting out a floating NAV proposal that 
they’re moving in the right direction.  And I ’m hopeful that what comes out will be something 
that’s sufficient to meet the very important need of stabilizing the money market funds.  
AKIO FUJII .  I’m Akio Fujii, Nikkei Newspaper .  Thank you, Chairman .  Recently , we 
have seen great volatility in Japanese market —equity, JGB , and foreign exchange .  Some say 
this volatility is  due to un certainty to the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy direction , but other s 
say this is due to lack of confidence to the Bank of Japan ’s monetary  policy .  So how do you 
view the Bank of Japan’ s efforts?  Do you still support Bank of Japan policy?  And other 
question is , how much do you pay attention to the spillover effect to the international market 
when you consider exit strategy?  
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
26 of 28  
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I think the volatility is mostly linked to the Bank of 
Japan ’s efforts , and that would seem logical , since in earlier episodes , when the Fed was doing 
asset purchases and the BOJ was not doing an ything, there was no volatility .  So it sort of seems 
logical that the change here is the change in BOJ policy .   
The BOJ is fighting against a  very difficult , entrenched deflation.  And , of course, 
deflation has been a problem in Japan for many, many years , which means that expectations are 
very much —the public ’s expectations are for continuing deflation, and therefore it takes very 
aggressive policies to break those expectations  and to  get inflation up to the 2 percent target that 
the Bank of Japan has set .   
So that ’s why it ’s difficult, they ’ve had to be very aggressive .  That aggressiveness in the 
early stages of this process , where investors are still learn ing about the BOJ ’s reaction function, 
it’s not all that surprising that there ’s volatility .  Also, the JGB markets are less liquid than , say, 
the T reasury market , for example.  So I —you know, I think that ’s something they need to pay 
close attention to , but, on the whole, I think that it is important for Japan to attack deflation.  And 
I also agree with the “ three arrows, ” the idea that besides breaking deflation , it’s important to 
address fiscal  and structural issues as well .  So, I ’m supportive of my c olleague , Mr. Kuroda, and 
I’m supportive of what Japan is doing , even though it does have some effects on our economy as 
well.   
The—there are a lot of reasons why emerging markets and other countries experience 
capital inflows and volatility .  Some of them have to do with changes in growth expectations .  
For example, we ’ve seen a lot of changes in growth patterns in the emerging markets recently .  
Some of it has  to do with risk- on, risk- off behavior , and some of it probably does have to do with 
monetary policy in  advanced economies , which include s, of course , the United States .  We do 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
27 of 28  
 take it —pay attention to that .  I frequently meet with colleagues from emerging markets at  the 
G-20, for example, and we discuss  these issues .  I think the right way to think about  it is that, as 
the G -7 and the G -20 both have noted, that what U .S. monetary policy , like that of Japan , is 
trying to do is trying to help this economy grow .  And a global recovery, a global —strong global 
growth depends very much on the U .S. growing at a reasonable rate.  And so, while there is some 
effect, I think the net effect , including a stronger U .S. economy , is, on the whole , positive, and I 
think most of my colleagues in emerging markets  recognize that .  That being said , anything we 
can do through communication or other means to try to minimize any overflow effects or side 
effects, we will certainly do.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Hello Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.com .  You 
know, you ’ve talked about being i n uncharted territory with policy , and we can remember that 
these news conferences  just bega n about two years ago as well , and so there ’s that mix of 
communication and  policy .  Insofar as the FOMC decided not to include the information a bout 
adjusting the asset purchases today, how do you walk that fine line ?  And why did the FOMC 
decide essentially to leave it to you to describe that, as opposed to putting it down in its own words?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , again, we don ’t think of this as a change in policy .  
What I was deputized to do, if you will, was to try to make somewhat clearer the implications of our existing policy and to try to explain better how the policy would evolve in various economic scenarios , and that ’s a little bit difficult to put into, you know, a very terse FOMC statement .  
Now that being said , going forward, I think that, yo u know, some of these elements, to the extent 
that we can make them useful , will begin to appear in the FOMC statement .  It’s enti rely 
possible .  But it seemed like the right tactic in this case to explain these fairly subtle 
June 19, 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL

 contingencies in a context where I could answer questions and respond to any misunderstandings 
that might occur.  
Thank you.

Page 1 of 2 7 Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference 
September 18, 2013  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) concluded a two -day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, 
the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent 
and to make no ch ange in either its asset purchase program or its forward guidance regarding the 
federal funds rate target.  I will discuss the rationales for our decision in a moment. 
Economic growth has generally been proceeding at a moderate pace,  with continued—
albeit  somewhat uneven —improvement in labor market conditions.  Of course, to say that the 
job market has improved does not imply that current conditions are satisfactory .  Notably, at 
7.3 percent, the unemployment rate remains well above acceptable levels.   Long -term 
unemployment and underemployment remain high.  And we have seen ongoing declines in labor 
force participation, which likely  reflects discouragement on the part of many potential workers as 
well as longer -term influences , such as the aging of the population.   
In the Committee’s assessment,  the downside risks to growth have diminished , on net, 
over the past year, reflecting, among other factors, somewhat better economic and financial conditions in Europe and increased confidence on the part of househol ds and firms  in the staying 
power of the U.S. recovery .  However, the tightening of financial conditions  observed in recent 
months , if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and the labor market.  
In addition, federal fiscal policy continues to be an important restraint on growth and a source of downside risk. 
Apart from  some fluctuations due primarily to changes in oil prices, inflation has 
continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term objective .  The Committee 
recogniz es that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 2 of 2 7 performance, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments closely.   However, the 
unwinding of some transitory factors has led to mode rately  higher inflation recently, as expected .  
And, with longer -term inflation expectations well anchored , the Committee anticipates that 
inflation will gradua lly move back toward 2 percent. 
In conjunction with this meeting, the 17 participants in our policy discussions —5 Board 
members and 12 Reserve Bank presidents —submitted individual economic projections.  As 
always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate 
monetary policy.  Also, at this meeting, we extended t he horizon of our projections through 
2016.   
Generally, the projections of individual participants s how that they continue to expect 
moderate economic growth, picking up over time, as well as gradual progress towards  levels of 
unemployment and inflation, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate to foster 
maximum employment and price stability.  More specifically , participants’ projections for 
economic growth have a central tendency of 2.0 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to 2.9 to 3.1 percen t in 2014 and 2.5 to 3.3 percent in 2016.  For the unemployment rate, t he central 
tendency of projections for the fourth quarter of each year is 7.1 to 7.3 percent for 2013, declining to 6.4 to 6.8 percent in 2014 and, by 2016, to 5.4 to 5.9 percent —about the longer -run 
normal level for the unemployment rate.   Most participants see inflation gradually increasing 
from its current low level toward the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent .  The central 
tendency of their projections for inflation is 1.1 to 1.2 percent for this year, 1.3 to 1.8 percent for 2014, and 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016.   
With unemployment still elevated and inflation projected to run below the Committee’s 
longer -run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.  As you 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 3 of 2 7 know, in normal times , the Committee eases monetary policy by lowering its target for the short-
term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate.  However, the target range for the federal funds 
rate, currently at 0 to ¼ percent, cannot be lowered meaningfully further.  Accordingly, the 
Committee has been  providing policy support to the economy through two complementary  
methods:  by purchasing and holding Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities 
and by communicating  the C ommittee’s  plans for setting the federal funds rate target over the 
medium term.  I’ll discuss these tools in turn, beginning with our program of asset purchases.  
In September 2012, the FOMC initiated a program of purchasing $40 billion per month in 
agency  mortgage -backed securities, in addition to the $45 billion per month in longer -term 
Treasury securities that we were already acquiri ng as part of our m aturity extension program.  
We stated that , subject to our ongoing assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program,  
purchases would continue until we saw a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor 
market in a context of price stability.  In December  2012, we announced that we would continue 
to purchase $45 billion per month in longer -term Tre asuries  after the m aturity e xtension program 
ended later that month.  Thus, our total purchases of longer -term securities were maintained at 
$85 billion per month, in addition to the reinvestment or rolling over of maturing securities on our balance sheet.   The Committee agreed today to contin ue asset purchases at that rate, subject 
to the same conditions that we laid out a year ago.  
Because the Committee tied its asset purchases to the outlook for the labor market, it’ s 
important to assess how that outlook has evolved.  As I noted earlier, conditions in the job 
market today  are still far from what all of us would like to see.   Nevertheless, meaningful 
progress has been made in the year since we announced the asset purcha se program.  For 
example, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent at the time of our announcement to 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 4 of 2 7 7.3 percent today, and about 2.3 million private -sector jobs have been created over the same 
period.  Over the past 12 months, aggregate hours of  work are up by about 2.4 percent, weekly 
new claims for unemployment insurance have  fallen by about 50,000, and surveys suggest that 
households perceive jobs as more readily available.  Importantly, these gains were achieved 
despite substantial fisc al headwinds, which are likely slowing  economic growth this year by a 
percentage point , or more , and reducing employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs .  Not all 
labor market developments  over the past year  were positive, however; notably, the labor force 
participation rate fell by about 0.3 percentage points  and real wages remained about flat.  
In light of this cumulative progress,  the FOMC concluded at our June meeting that the 
criterion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market  might well be met over 
the subsequent year  or so .  Accordingly, the Committee sought to provide more guidance on how 
the pace of purchases  might  be adjusted over time.  T he Committee anticipated in June that, 
subject to certain conditions, it might be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchase s 
later this year , continuing to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half 
of next year, and ending purchases around midyear 2014.  However, we also made clear at that time that adjustments  to the pace of purchases would depend importantly on the evolution of the 
economic outlook—in particular, on the receipt of evidence supporting the Committee’s expectation that gains in the labor market will be sustained and that inflation is moving back towards  its 2 percent objective over time.  
At the meeting concluded earlier today, the sense of the Committee was that the broad 
contours of the medium -term economic outlook— including  economic growth sufficient to 
support ongoing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving towards  its objective —were 
close to the views it held in June.  But in evaluating whether a modest reduction in the pace of 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 5 of 2 7 asset purchases would be appropriate at this meeting, however, the Committee concluded that the 
economic data do not yet provide sufficient confirmation of its baseline outlook to warrant such a reduction.  Moreover, the Committee has some concern that the rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months could have the effect of slowing growth, as I noted earlier, a concern that would be exacerbated if conditions tightened further.  Finally, the extent of the effects of restrictive fiscal policies remain  unclear, and upcoming fiscal debates may involve additional 
risks to financial markets and to the broader economy.  In light of these uncertainties , the 
Committee decided to await more evidence that the recovery’s progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases.   
The Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic and financ ial 
developments closely.  As noted in today’s statement, i n judging when to moderate the pace of 
asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming 
information continues to support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing i mprovement in labor 
market conditions and inflation moving back towards  its longer -run objective.  However, as  we 
have said , and  as today’s decision underscores, asset purchases are not on a preset course .  The 
Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the economic outlook and on the Committee’s ongoing assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of the program.  
Let me turn now to the FOMC’s forward guidance regarding the federal funds r ate.  The 
Committee again reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low range for the funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 ½ percent, so 
long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well  behaved as described in our  statement .  
As I have noted frequently, the economic conditions we have set out as preceding any future rate increase are thresholds, not triggers.  For example, a decline in the unemployment rate to 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 6 of 2 7 6½ percent would not le ad automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate target, but 
would, instead , indicate only that it had become appropriate for the Committee to consider 
whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.  The Committee would be 
unlike ly to increase rates  if inflation were projected to remain below our 2 percent objective for 
some time, for example ; and, in making its assessment, the Committee would also take into 
account additional measures of labor market conditions, such as job gains .  Thus, the first 
increases in short -term rates might not occur until the unemployment rate is considerably below 
6½ percent.  
The projections of the path of the federal funds rate by individual Committee participants 
are generally consistent with this guidance.  Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6 ½ percent, 12 of the 
17 participants expect the first rate increase to take place in 2015 and two expect it to occur in 
2016.   
Most p articipants also see the funds rate target rising only very slowly after the process of  
removing policy accommodation begins.  The median projected funds rate for the end of 2015 is 1 percent.  And notably, although the central tendencies of the projections for both inflation and the unemployment rate in 2016 are close to the longer -run normal values  for those variables , the 
median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of  2016 is  2 percent , well below the 
longer -run normal value for the federal f unds rate  of 4 percent or so projected by most 
participants .  Committee participants generally believe that, because the headwinds to recovery 
will abate only gradually, achieving and maintaining maximum employment and price stability will require a patien t policy approach that involves keeping the target for the federal funds rate 
below its longer -run normal value for some time.  
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 7 of 2 7 Let me close by noting that although the FOMC is employing two instruments of 
policy —asset purchases and forward guidance about s hort-term interest rates —the overall stance 
of monetary policy is what matters for growth, jobs, and inflation.  Our program of asset 
purchases was set up a year ago to help achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in the conte xt of price stability, relative to conditions when the program was 
initiated, and we have made progress toward meeting that criterion.  However, even after asset purchases are wound down—which we will do in a manner that is both deliberate and dependent on the incoming economic data —the Federal Reserve’s rates guidance and its ongoing holdings 
of securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with an aggressive pursuit of our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  
Thank you, and I’d be glad to take your questions. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Pedro da Costa from Reuters .  You cite 
meaningful progress on the labor market both on the unemployment front and in terms of payroll growth .  But  much of the decline in the unemployment rate has been due , as you know , to the 
decline in participation .  So my question to you is —and also on the payroll front, some people 
would argue that, while  there has been growth, it hasn ’t been strong enough to ke ep up with 
population growth and make  up the gap that we have from the recession .  So, how high do you 
think the jobless rate would be if it were not for the decline in participation ?  I’ve heard estimates 
as high as 10 to 11 percent .  And could you put th e labor market in that context? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Certainly .  So, I think there is a cyclical component to 
participation , and , in that respect, the unemployment rate understates the amount of sort of true 
unemployment , if you will , in the economy .  But o n the other hand, there is also a downward 
trend in participation in our economy , which is arising from factors that have been going on for 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 8 of 2 7 some time , including an aging population, lower participation by prim e-age males, fewer women 
in the labor force —other factors which aren ’t really related to this recession .   
Over the last year, the unemployment rate has dropped by eight -tenths  of a percentage 
point .  The participation rate has  dropped by three -tenths  of a percentage point, which is pretty 
close to the  trend .  So, in other words, I think it would be fair to s ay that most of the 
improvement in  the unemployment rate —not all, but most of it in the last year —is due to job 
creation rather than lower participation .  I would also note that if you look at the broader 
measures of unemployment that the BLS publishes , including part -time work, including 
discouraged workers and so on, you’ ll see that those rates have fallen about the same amount as 
the overall standard civilian unemployment rate .  So I think that there has been progress , and it ’s 
obscure d to some extent by the downward trend in participation.  But I also would agree with 
you that the unemployment rate, while  perhaps the best single indicator of the state of labor 
market , is not by itself a fully re presentative indicator. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Binya  App elbaum, the New York Times .  To what extent do 
you regard yourself as responsible for the tightening in financial conditions that you noted?  Was 
it a mistake to talk about tapering in the way that you did in June and do you stand by your 
guidance that it will be appropriate ?  Do you still expect that it will be appropriate to dial down 
asset purchases by the end of this year?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So to  answer the first part of your question, I think ther e’s 
no alternative in making monetary policy but to communicate as clearly as possible , and that ’s 
what we tried to do.  As of June, we had made meaningful progress in labor market conditions , 
and the C ommittee thought that was the time to begin talking ab out how the eventual wind- down 
of the program would take place and how it would be tied to the evolution of economic variables .  
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 9 of 2 7 And, in particular, I talked about a proposed strategy that would take about a year for the total 
wind -down to take place and w hich, in turn, was also fully contingent on the ratification —so to 
speak —of our outlook, which included continued improvements in the labor market .  So all of 
that was very consistent with what we said when we began the program , that our goal was to 
achieve a substantial improvement in  the outlook for the labor market , and we needed to 
communicate how that was going to be put into practice .  Failing to communica te that 
information would have  risked creating a large divergence bet ween market expectations, public 
expectations, and what the C ommittee intentions were , and that could have led to much more 
serious problems down the road.  So I think the communication was very important .   
The general framework —to answer the other part of your question, the general 
framework in which we ’re operating is still the same .  We have a three- part baseline projection , 
which involves increasing growth that ’s picking up over  time as fiscal drag is reduced, 
continuing gains in the labor market , and inflation moving back towards objective .  We are 
looking to see —in the coming meetings, we ’ll be looking to see if the data confirm that basic 
outlook.  If it does, we ’ll take a first step at some point—possibly later this year —and then 
continue so long as  the data are consistent with that continued  progress .  And so that basic 
structure is still in place . 
But what I want to emphasize is really two things .  First, as I ’ve said, asset purchases are 
not on a preset course, they are conditional on the data .  They’ve always been conditional on the 
data.  And , secondly, that even as we move from asset purchases to rate policy as the principal 
tool of monetary policy , it’s our intent to maintain a highly accommodative policy and to provide 
the support necessary fo r our economy to recover and to provide jobs for our citizens. 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 10 of 2 7 JON HILSENRATH.  Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Just to follow up on 
Binya’s question, Mr. Chairman, you said that you could pull  back the purchases possibly later 
this year .  You sound a little bit less certain that it’ s going to happen later this year .  So I ’d like 
you—to ask you to talk a little bit more about your conviction about whether these are like —the 
pullback is likely to start this year, wh ere do you stand on that ?  And I also don’ t think I heard 
you mentioned that 7 percent unemployment number that you’ ve talked —you talked about back 
in June .  That was the rate that was —the unemployment rate that was supposed to prevail when 
the Fed was done doing this .  Is that no l onger operative?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So ther e is no fixed calendar —schedule, I really have to 
emphasize that .  If the data confirm our  basic outlook, if we gain more confidence in that outlook 
and we believe that the three- part test that I mentioned is ind eed coming to pass, then we could 
move later this year , we could begin later this year .  But even if we do that, the subsequent steps 
will be dependent on continued progress in the economy .  So we are tied to the data—we don ’t 
have a fixed calendar schedul e—but we do have the same basic framework that I described in 
June.   
The criterion for ending the asset purchases  program is a substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market .  Last time, I gave 7 percent as an indicative number to give you 
some sense of, you know, where that might be .  But, as my first answer suggested,  the 
unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure, in  all circumstances , of the  state of the  
labor market overall .  For example, just last month, the decline in  the unemployment rate came 
about more than entirely because of declining participation, not because of increased jobs .  So 
what we will be looking at is the overall labor market situation, including the unemployment 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 11 of 2 7 rate, but including other factors as well .  But , in particular, there is not any magic number that we 
are shooting for .  We ’re looking for overall improvement in the labor market. 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman , with CNBC .  Mr. Chairman, one question—just 
three parts , if you don ’t mind .  Have you indicated to President Obama you did not want to serve 
a third term?  If so, when ?  Or did President Obama i ndicate to you he did not want  you to serve 
a third term?  A nd those two parts notwithstanding, would you serve a third term if asked,  either 
wholly or in part ?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Wel l, it’s convenient  because I have the same answer to all 
three parts of your question.  If you  will indulge me just a little longer, I prefer not to talk about 
my plans at this point .  I hope to have more infor mation for you at some reasonably soon date, 
but today I want to focus on monetary policy .  I’d prefer not to talk about  my own plans.  
YLAN MUI .  Ylan Mui, Washington Post .  You mentioned that tighter fiscal conditions 
are a concern for the C ommittee as yo u guys think about whether or not it ’s appropriate to 
reduce asset purchases .  What do you all expect to be able to do in the future , when you actually 
do begin to pull  back in your asset purchases , to manage expectations and manage the market 
reactions su ch that we don ’t see another increase in rates?  
CHAIRMAN BERNAKE .  What’s the relationship between the pullback and fiscal 
policy?  
YLAN MUI .  Oh, I ’m sorry .  I meant financial conditions, tighter  financial conditions. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Oh, tighter financial conditions, sure .  Well, I think part of 
the reaction we’ ve seen —and it comes from a number of sources —part of it comes from 
improved economic news and that’ s part of the reason why rates have gone up in other countries 
as well as in the United S tates.  And that —to the extent that tighter financial conditions reflect a 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 12 of 2 7 better outlook, that ’s a good thing , and that ’s not a problem at all .  Part of it reflects views  about 
monetary policy , and that we want to make sure we get straight .  And that ’s wh y—to answer the 
earlier question, again, it ’s why communication is so important .  We need to explain , as best we 
can, how we ’re going to move and on what bas is we’re going to move .  It’s much more difficult 
today than it was 20 years ago because the tools are more complex so they ’re less familiar, but 
that’s still very important .   
I think the other factor which was at play was an unwinding of excessively risky and 
levered  positions in the markets , and insufficiencies of liquidity in some cases meant that t hose 
unwindings led to larger reactions in prices and rates than might otherwise have occurred.  Now, 
the tightening associated with that is , to some extent , unwelcome, but , on the other hand, to the 
extent that some of the riskier, more lever ed positions have been eliminated, I think that makes 
the situation more sustainable and reduces , at least , the risk that there will be an over -strong 
reaction to further announcements .   
So we will do our best to communicate clearly .  That is our goal and our objective .  The 
more clearly we communicate, the better the chance that markets will understand our intentions and that we can avoid any sharp movements .  But , again, we ’re dealing with tools that are less 
familiar , harder to quantify, and harder to com municate about than the traditional funds rate.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding , from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, the 
median C ommittee member expect s a 2 percent interest rate at the end of 2016 , and , in the long 
run, they expect interest rates to return to 4 percent .  Can you give us any sense of when you and 
when the C ommittee expect interest rates to get back to that 4 percent figure ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Let me first restate  the—I think the key point here , which is 
that the large majority of the pa rticipants  of the FOMC , including voting and nonvoting members  
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 13 of 2 7 who a re asked to describe their own assessment of optimal policy —the large majority of them 
estimate that the appropriate target for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will be around 
2 percent , even though at that time the economy should be close to full employment , according 
to our best projections .  The reason for that —there may  be possibly several reasons, but we did 
discuss this in the C ommittee today —the primary reason for that low value is that we expect that 
a number of factors —including the slow recovery of the housing sector , continued fiscal drag, 
perhaps continued effects from the f inancial crisis —may still prove  to be headwinds to the 
recovery .  And even though we can achieve full employment, doing so will be done by using 
rates lower than , sort of , the long -run normal .  So, in other words, in economics terms, the 
equilibrium rate, the rate that achieves full employment, looks like it will be lower for a time 
because of these h eadwinds that will be slowing aggregate demand growth .   
So that ’s why we expect to see growth that —I mean , rates at an unusually low level .  I 
imagine  it would take a few more years after that to get to the 4 percent level .  I couldn’ t be 
much more precis e than that —I mean , we’re already obviously stretching the bounds of 
credibility to talk about specific projections to 2016.  But I think you would expect to see that  
rates would gradually rise for the two or three years after 2016 and ultimately get to 4 percent.  
JOSH ZUMBRUN.  Mr. Chairman, Josh Zumbrun from Bloomberg News .  You 
indicated that you can see the F ed lowering the pace of purchases once the economy starts to 
grow faster, in line with what the F ed’s projected .  For about the past four years, the F ed has 
been projecting that growth would quicken to about 3 percent , and it never has .  So, at what point 
are you decide —going to decide that other c osts and benefits are the reason that you ’re making 
the decision ?  Are we getting close to that having  to be a deciding factor even if you don’ t get the 
growth forecast , the way you have n’t the past four years ?  And does the complication of this —
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 14 of 2 7 this is kind of a second question, but I’m going to do it  anyway—does the complication of this 
mean that you nee d a press conference to make a tapering decision?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, you’ re certainly right that we have been over -
optimistic about out -year growth .  There are a number of reasons for that .  One reason for  it, 
though, is that it appears —and I talked  about this in a  speech last year —it appears that , as part of 
the aftermath of the financial crisis , that , at least temporarily, the potential growth rate of the 
economy has been slowed, perhaps because new businesses are not being formed at  the same 
rate, innovation may not be translated into new technologies at the same rate, investment is 
slower, et cetera.  So it appears , again , that the potential rate of growth of the economy has been 
slowed somewhat , at least temporarily , by the recessi on and  the financial crisis , and you can see 
that in the slower productivity figures .   
Now, we have —you know, we haven’ t anticipated that slowdown in productivity , and 
that’s one of the main reasons why we haven ’t anticipated the relatively slow growth .  Now, it ’s 
important to recognize though that what monetary policy affects is not the potential rate of growth, long -run rate of growth, but rather the cyclical part, the deviation of output and 
employment from its normal level.  And in predicting the amount of slack in the economy , so to 
speak, we ’ve done a little better .  Our predictions of unemployment , for example, ha ve been 
better than our predictions of growth.  A nd, in particular, one thing that ’s been quite striking is 
that unemployment —we were too p essimistic on unemployment for this year .  Unemployment 
has fallen faster than we anticipated .  So, in that respect, we were too pessimistic rather than too 
optimistic .  So, we ’ll continue to do the best we can.  We ’re looking , again , to see confirmation 
of our broader scenario , which basically is that we ’ll continue to see progress in the labor market ,  
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 15 of 2 7 that growth will be sufficient to support that progress , and th at inflation will be moving back 
towards target , and that ’s what wi ll determine our policy decisions .   
In terms of press conferences, I think it ’s important to say that there ’s an understanding in 
the C ommittee that we ’ve had for a while , that there are eight “ real” meetings every year —that 
every meeting is a meeting in which any policy decisio n can be taken .  And , should anything 
occur at a meeting without a scheduled press conference that requires additional explanation, we 
certainly could arrange a public , on-the-record conference call or some other way of answering 
the media ’s questions.  
GRE G IP.  Greg Ip of the Economist .  You said that you—the C ommittee would be 
unlikely to raise the federal funds rate if inflation remains below target, but your own projections have inflation—that ’s the midpoint of your inflation projections —below your 2 pe rcent target 
through 2016.  S o is that inconsistent with the liftoff in the federal funds rate in that period ?  
And, related, is there a case to be made that your threshold s should be supplemented with a 
lower bound for the inflation rate —i.e. , you won’ t tighten if inflation is at  or below some lower 
bound?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So on the latter part, you know, of course, you’ re seeing 
interest rate projections and inflation projections separately .  You’re not seeing them combined 
by individuals .  Each individual is making their own projection .  I think you’ re right, I mean, that 
we should be very reluctant to raise rates if inflation remains persistently below target , and that ’s 
one of the reasons that I think we can be very patient in raising the feder al funds rate since we 
have not seen any inflation pressure .   
On having an inflation floor , that would be in  addition to the guidance .  We are 
discussing how we might clarify the guidance on the federal funds rate .  That is certainly one 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 16 of 2 7 possibility .  I guess an interesting question there is whether we need additional guidance on that , 
given that we do have a target .  And , of course , implicit in our policy strategy is trying to reach 
that target for inflation, but that —an inflation floor is certainly something that, you know, could 
be a sensible modification or addition to the guidance.  
VICTORIA McGRANE .  Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones Newswires .  Many investors 
were expecting the Fed to move at least  a little bit in pulling back the bond -buying program 
today .  Given that you all decided not to do that , are—do you have any  concerns that , once again, 
the F ed is confusing investors and sending mix ed signals?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I don’ t recall stating that we would do any par ticular 
thing in this meeting .  What we are going to do is the right thing for the economy .  And our 
assessment of the data since June is that , taken collectively , that it didn ’t quite meet the standard 
of satisfying our —or of ratifying or confirming our basic outlook for , again, increasi ng growth , 
improving labor markets , and  inflation moving back towards target .  We try our  best to 
communicate to markets —we ’ll continue to do that —but we can ’t let market expectations dictate 
our policy actions .  Our policy actions have to be determined by  our best assessment of what ’s 
needed for the economy.  
PETER BARNES .  Peter Barnes, Fox Business , sir.  You mentioned fiscal issues in the 
statement today .  Are you concerned about a government shutdown?  We’re hearing more about 
that possibility .  Did tha t come up in your discussions at this meeting ?  W hat do you think w ould 
be the impact of a government shutdown on the economy , and what could the F ed’s—or, would 
the F ed be prepared to respond to that and help the economy  with additional accommodation , for 
example, additional asset purchases ?  Thank you.  
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 17 of 2 7 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, a fact or that  did concern us in our discussion was 
some upcoming fiscal policy decisions .  I would include both the possibility of a government 
shutdown, but also the debt limit is sue.  These are obviously, you know, part of a very 
complicated set of legislative decisions, strategies, battles, et cetera, which I won ’t get into .  But 
it is the case , I think, that a government shutdown —and perhaps , even more so , a failure  to raise 
the debt limit—could have very serious consequences for the financial markets and for the 
economy , and the Federal Reserve’ s policy is to do whatever we can to keep the economy on 
course .  And so, if these actions led the economy to slow, then we  would have to take that into 
account , surely .  So this is one of the risks that we are looking at as we think about policy .  That 
being said, you know, again, our ability to offset these shocks is very limited, particularly a debt  
limit shock.  And I think it ’s extraordinarily important that Congress and the A dministration 
work together to find a way to make sure that the government is funded, public services are 
provided, that the government pays its bills , and that we avoid any kind of event like 2011, 
which had, at least for a time, a noticeable adverse effect on confidence and on the economy.  
ANNALYN KURTZ .  Annalyn Kurtz , with CNNMoney .  This week marks five years 
since the financial crisis began , and Hank Paulson, who you ’ve worked very closely with, has 
said his biggest regret was that he wasn’ t able to convince the Ame rican people that what was 
done — the bank bailouts —weren ’t for Wall Street, they were for Main Street .  What is your 
biggest regret as you reflect on the five -year anniversar y?  And do you believe that the F ed, 
Congress , and the P resident  have put the necessary measures in place to prevent another deep 
financial crisis?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, on regrets, as Frank Sinatra  says, I have many .  I 
think my —you know, reasonably , the biggest  regret I have is that we didn ’t forestall the crisis .  I 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 18 of 2 7 think once the crisis got going, it was extremely hard to prevent .  You know, I think we did what 
we could, given the powers that we had, and I would agree with Hank that we were motivated 
entirely by the interest of the broader public , that our goal was to stabilize the financial system so 
that it would not bring the economy down, so that it would not create massive unemployment and economic hardship that was even more —that would have been even more  severe by many 
times than what we actually saw .  So I agree with him on that .  And I guess, since you gave me 
the opportunity, I would mention that, of course, all the money that was used in those operations has been paid back with int erest .  And so, it hasn ’t been costly , even from a fiscal point of view .   
Now, in terms of progress, that ’s a good question.  I think we ’ve made a lot of progress .  
We had, of course, the Dodd–Frank l aw passed in 2010, and then we recently, you know, have 
come to agreement i nternationally on a number of measures , including Basel III and other 
agreements relating to the shadow banking system and other aspects of the financial system .  I 
think that our —today, our large financial firms, for example, are better capitalized by far  than 
they were certainly during the crisis and even before the crisis .  Supervision is tougher .  We do 
stress testing to make sure that firms can withstand not only normal shocks , but very, very large 
shocks , similar to those they experienced in 2008.  An d, very importantly, of course, we now 
have a to ol that we didn’ t have in 2008—which would have made , I think, a signific ant 
difference if we had had it —which is the orderly l iquidation a uthority that the Dodd–Frank bill 
gave to the FDIC in collaboration with the F ed.  Under the orderly l iquidation a uthority, the 
FDIC , with other agencies , has the ability to wind down a failing financial firm in a way that 
minimizes the direct impact on the financial markets and on the economy .   
Now, I should say, I don’ t want to overstate the case— I think there ’s a lot more work to 
be done .  In the case of resolution regimes, for example, the United States has set the course 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 19 of 2 7 internationally .  Other countries and international bodies like the FSB are setting up standards f or 
resolution regimes, which are very similar to those of the United States, which is going to make 
for better cooperation across borders .  But we ’re still some distance from being fully geared up 
to work with foreign counterparts to successfully wind down an international—multinational financial firm.  And that ’s—we ’ve made progress in that direction , but we need to do more , I 
think.  So, I think there ’s more to be done .  There ’s more to be done on derivatives, although a 
lot has been done to make them mor e transparent and to make the trading of derivatives  safer .  
But it’ s going to be probably some  time before, you know, all of this stuff that has been 
undertaken, all of these measures are fully implemented .  And we can assess, you know, the 
ultimate impac t on the financial system.  
STEVE BECKNER .  Steve Beckner of MNI , Mr. Chairman .  A number of economists , 
and, indeed, some of your F ed colleagues , have argued that the effectiveness of quantitative 
easing has greatly diminished , if not disappeared, and they  point to the rec ent performance of the 
economy a s proof of that .  And there have been a number of people who have argued that there 
are regulatory and other impediments to growth beyond the reach of monetary policy .  To what 
extent are these valid arguments ?  And if the economy does not speed up, if it does not reach 
your objectives, how will you ever get out of quantitative easing?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, on the effectiveness of our asset purchases, it ’s 
difficult to get a precise measure .  There ’s a large academic literature on this subject,  and they 
have a range of results, s ome suggesting that this is a quite powerful tool, some that it’ s less 
powerful .  My own assessment is that it has been effective.  If you look at the recovery, you see 
that some of the strongest sectors, the leading sectors like housing and autos, have been interest-
sensitive sectors .  And that these policies have been successful in strengthening financial 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 20 of 2 7 conditions, lowering interest rates, and thereby promoting recovery .  So I do think that they have 
been effective.  You mentioned that there hasn’ t been any progress .  There has been a lot of 
progress .  As I said at the beginning , labor market indicators, while still not where we ’d like 
them to be , are much better today than they were when we began this latest program a year ago .  
And, importantly —as actually is referenced in our FOMC statement —that happened 
notwithstanding a set of fiscal policies which the CBO said would cost between 1 and 
1½ percentage points of real grow th and hundreds of thousands of jobs .  So the fact that we have 
maintained improvements in the labor market that are as good or better than the previous year, 
notwithstanding this fiscal drag , is some indication that there is at least a partial offset from 
monetary policy .   
Now, just as you say, there are a lot of things in the economy that monetary policy can’t  
address .  They include the effectiveness of regulation, they include fiscal policy, they include 
developments in the private sector .  We do what we can do and what —if we can get help, we ’re 
delighted to have help from other policymakers and from the private sector and we hope that that will happen.  The criterion for ending asset purchases is not, you know, some very high rate of growth .  What it is is the criterion —let me just remind you, the criterion is a substantial 
improvement in the outlook for the labor market , and we have made significant improvement .  
Ultimately, we will reach that level of substantial improvement, and at that point, we wil l be able 
to wind down the asset purchases .  Again, you know, and I think people don’ t fully appreciate 
that we have two tools :  We have asset purchases , and we have rate policy and guidance about 
rates .  It’s our view that the latter, the rate policy , is actually the stronger, more reliable tool .  
And when we get to the point where we can, you know, where we are close enough to full employment that rate policy will be sufficient, I think that we will still be able to provide —even 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 21 of 2 7 if asset purchases are  reduced —we will still be able to provide a highly accommodative 
monetary background that will allow the economy to continue to grow and move towards full 
employment.  
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman, Donna Borak, with American Banker .  The Financial 
Stability Oversight Council has already designated t wo nonbank firms as SIFIs , as you know, 
and potentially a third very soon, and presumably others to follow .  However, little has been said 
in terms of how specifically these firms will be regulated by the F ed, which has bee n a chief 
criticism of the entire process .  Given that, can you provide us any guidance at this point in terms 
of how far along the F ed is in terms of letting the banks know how they will be regulated 
besides, you know, tailoring the plans ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNAN KE.  Well, the two firms that ha ve been designated, AIG and GE 
Capital , actually are—ha ve been regulated by the Fed, because both of them are savings and 
loan, thrift holding companies .  So we have a lot of already experience with those firms and a lot 
of contact with those firms .  We will—I want to use the word “ tailored ” because we want to 
design a regime that is appropriate for the business model of the particular firm.  But our other objective , and what makes designation by the FSOC particularly notewor thy, is that the primary 
goal of the consolidated supervision by the Fed is to make sure that the firms —the firm doesn’ t 
in any way endanger the stability of the broad financial system .  So we ’ll be looking at not just 
the usual safety and soundness type m atters or supervision, which both can be , again , tailored to 
the types of assets and liabilities that the firm has, but also we ’re going to want to focus on things 
like resolution authority, practices relating to derivatives and other exposures, interconne ctedness , et cetera, to make sure that the firm in its structure and in its operations 
doesn’ t pose a threat to the wider system .  And that ’s what is going to be distinctive about our 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 22 of 2 7 oversight , not only of these designated firms , but also of the large bank holding companies that 
we already oversee and which we are already subjecting to tougher supervision, higher capital, 
stress tests, and all the rest.  
PETER COOK .  Peter Cook of  Bloomberg Television, Mr. Chairman .  One of my 
colleagues was remarking as we came in here, we don’ t often get surprises from the Federal 
Reserve.  This was a surprise, you talked about —you hadn’ t telegraphed anything specifically, 
but you’ ve seen the market reaction , I’m sure .  My question for you is , were you intending a 
surprise today , and did you get the intended result , judging from the market reaction ?  And 
related to that, by taking this action  today —continuing the bond purchases going forward— at 
what point do you believe you ’re starting to complicate the exit strategy ?  Simply by continuing 
to keep the F ed’s foot on the gas pedal, do you make life more complicated for the Federal 
Reserve down the road?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, it’ s our intention to try to set policy as appropriate for 
the econom y, as I said earlier .  We are somewhat concerned .  I won ’t overstate it, but we do want 
to see the effects of higher interest rates on the economy , particularly in mortgage rates , on 
housing .  So to the extent that our policy makes conditions —our policy de cision today makes 
conditions just a little bit easier, that’ s desirable.  We want to make sure that the economy has 
adequate support and, in particular, it’s less surprising the market or easing polic y as it is 
avoiding a tightening until we can be comfor table that the economy is in fact growing, you 
know, the way we want it to be growing .  So this was a step —it was a step , a precautionary step 
if you will.  It was a —the intention is to wait a bit longer and to try to get confirming evidence 
whether to the —to whether or not the economy is , in fact , conforming to this general outlook 
that we have.  I don’ t think that we are complicating anything for future FOMCs .  It’s true that 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 23 of 2 7 the assets that we’ ve been buying add to the size of our balance sheet .  But we have developed a 
variety of tools , and we think we have numerous tools that we —can be used to both manage 
interest rates and to ultimately unwind the balance sheet when the time comes .  So I, you know, 
I’m—I feel  quite comfortable that we can —in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the 
appropriate time , even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period .  And that will 
be true , of course , for, you know, future FOMCs as well. 
KATE DAVIDSON.  Mr. Chairman, Kate Davidson from P olitico .  Do you think that all 
of the recent attention being paid to who will be your replacement has h ad any immediate effect 
on the F ed, and could it have any lingering effect on your successor ?  And also, do you think the 
process has just become too politicized , or is this part of a healthy debate?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  I think the Federal Reserve has strong institutional 
credibility .  And it is a strong institution, a highly competent institution, and it ’s independent, it ’s 
nonpartisan, and I ’m not parti cularly concerned about the political environment for the Federal 
Reserve.  I think the Fed will be —continue to be an important institution in the United States , 
and that it will maintain its independence going forward.  
GREG ROBB .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Gre g Robb, MarketWatch .  Was there a 
discussion among the C ommittee today about changing the forward guidance, the 6.5 percent 
jobless rate ?  And could you say why the C ommittee decided to hold that steady in light of the 
weaker economy?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANK E.  Wel l, as I mentioned earlier, the C ommittee has regularly 
reviewed the forward guidance, and there are a number of ways in which the forward guidance 
could be strengthened .  For example, Mr. Ip mentioned an  inflation floor .  There are other steps 
that we could take .  We could provide more information about what happens after we get t o 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 24 of 2 7 6.5 percent and those sorts of things, and to the extent that we could provide precise guidance, I 
think that would be desirable .  Now, it ’s very important that we not tak e any of these steps 
lightly, that we make sure we understand all the implications , and that we are comfortable that it 
will be —that any modifications of the guidance will be credible to markets and to the public .  
So, we continue to think about options .  Ther e are a number of options that we  have talked about .  
But today, we —as of today, we didn’ t choose to make any changes to the guidance.  
DON LEE .  Don Lee, L.A. Times .  As you may know, the Census Bureau reported 
yesterday that the poverty rate and the m edian household income saw no improvement last year .  
And I wonder , when you see median incomes turning up significantly for most people , and in 
light of the fact that people in the middle and the bottom have seen very little of the gains relative to highe r income households, how would you assess the —both quantitative easing and 
Fed policies?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Sure .  So that ’s certainly the case that there are too many 
people in poverty .  There are a lot of complex issues involved.  There are complex meas urement 
issues, I would just have to mention that .  There are a lot of issues that are reall y long -term issues 
as well .  For  example, it might seem a puzzle that the U .S. economy gets richer and richer , and 
yet there are more poor people .   
And the explanation, of course, is that our economy is becoming more unequal .  The 
more very rich people and more people in the lower half who are not doing well, these are —
there’ s a lot of reasons behind this trend, which ha s been going on for decades, and econom ists 
disagree about the relative importance of things like technology  and international trade  and 
unionization and other factors that have contributed to that .  But I guess my first point is that 
these long- run trends —it’s important to address these trends , but the Federal Reserve doesn ’t 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 25 of 2 7 really have the tools to address these long -run distributional trends .  They can only be addressed 
really by Congress and by the A dministration .  And it ’s up to them, I think, to take those steps .  
The Federal Reserve is —we are doing our part to help the median family, the median American, 
because one of our principal goals —we have two principal goals, one i s maximum employment, 
jobs.  The best way to help families is to create employment opportunities .  We ’re still not 
satisfied, obviously, with where the labor market, the job market is .  We ’ll continue to try to 
provide support for that .  And then the other goal is price stability, low inflation, which, of 
course, also helps make the economy work better for people in the m iddle and the lower parts of 
the distribution .   
So we use the tools that we have .  It would be better to have a mix of tools at work—not 
just monetary policy , but fiscal policy and other policies as well .  But the Federal Reserve, we 
can—you know, we only  have a certain set of tools , and those are the ones that we use .  Again, 
our objective —our objectives of creating jobs and maintaining price stability, I think, are quite 
consistent with helping the average American, but there ’s limits to what we can do a bout long -
run trends , and I think those are very important issue s that Congress and the A dministration, you 
know, need to look at and decide, you know, what needs to be done there.  
JEREMY TORDJMAN.  Hi, Jeremy Tordjman , with AFP .  Some emerging countries are 
blaming the Fed policies for the financial distress that they are experiencing .  I wanted to have 
your take on that .  And also, how did you judge the way the markets reacted to your tapering 
announcement back in June ?  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, let me just talk about— I talk ed a little bit about the 
communication in June .  Let me talk just about the emerging markets , which I think is an 
important issue .  Let me just first say that we have a lot of economists w ho spend all of their time 
September 18 , 2013  Chairman Bernanke ’s Press Conference  FINAL 
Page 26 of 2 7 looking at international aspects of monetary policy , and we spend a lot of time looking at 
emerging markets .  I spend a lot of time talking to my colleagues in emerging markets .  So we ’re 
watching that very carefully .  The Unit ed States is part of a globally integrated economic and 
financial system , and problems in emerging markets —or in any country , for that matter —can 
affect the United States as well .  And so, again, we are watching those developments very 
carefully .   
It is tru e that changes in longer -term interest rates in the United States —but also in other 
advanced economies —does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are 
trying to pe g their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows .  But there are 
also other factors that affect inflows and outflows .  Those include changes in risk preference by 
investors, changes in growth expectations, different perceptions of institutional strength within 
emerging markets across different countries .  So there are a lot of factors that are there playing a 
role, and that ’s one reason why different emerging markets have had different experiences .  They 
have different institutional structures and different policies .  But , just to come to the bottom line 
here, we think it ’s very important that emerging markets grow and  are prosperous .  We pay close 
attention to what ’s happening in those countries —it affects the United States .   
The main point, I guess, I would end with, though , is that what we ’re trying to do with 
our monetary policy here is, I think, my colleagues in the emerging markets recognize , is trying 
to create a stronger U .S. economy .  And a stronger U .S. economy is one of the most important 
things that could happen to help the economies of emerging markets .  And, again, I think my 
colleagues in many of the emerging markets appreciate that —not withstanding some of the 
effects that they may have felt —that efforts to strengthen the U .S. economy and other advanced 
econom ies in Europe and elsewhere ultimately redounds  to the benefit of the global economy ,

Page 1 of 31  Transcript of Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference 
December 18, 2013  
 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) concluded a two -day meeting earlier today.  As you already know from our statement, 
the Committee decided, starting next month, to modestly reduce the pace at which it is increasing 
the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The Committee also clarified its guidance on interest rates, emphasizing that the current near -zero range for the federal funds rat e target likely 
will remain appropriate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.   
Today’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is 
continuing to make progress, but that it also has much farther to travel before conditions can be 
judged normal.  Notably, despite significant fiscal headwinds, the economy has been expanding at a moderate pace, and we expect that growth will pick up somewhat in coming quarters, helped by highly accommodative monetary policy and waning fiscal drag.  The job market has continued to improve, with the unemployment rate having declined further.  At the same time, the recover y clearly remains far from complete, with unemployment still elevated and with both 
underemployment and long -term unemployment still major concerns.  We have also seen 
ongoing declines in labor force participation, which likely reflect not only longer -term 
influences , such as the aging of the population, but also discouragement on the part of potential 
workers.  
Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent.  The 
Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 31  performance and is monitoring inflation developments carefully  for evidence that inflation will 
move back toward its objective over time .  
This outlook is broadly consistent with individual economic projections submit ted in 
conjunction with this meeting by the 17 FOMC participants —5 Board members and 12 Reserve 
Bank presidents.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own 
view of appropriate monetary policy.  FOMC participants generally expect economic growth to 
pick up somewhat over the next few years.  Their projections for increases in gross domestic product have a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, rising to between 2.8 and 3.2 percent for next year, with similar growth estimates for 2015 and 2016.  Participants see the unemployment rate, which was 7 percent in November, as continuing to decline.  The central tendency of the projections has the unemployment rate falling to between 6.3 and 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter  of 2014 and then to between 5.3 and 5.8 percent by the final quarter of 2016.  
Meanwhile,  FOMC participants continue to see inflation running below our 2 percent objective 
for a time but moving gradually back toward 2 percent as the economy expands.  The central tendency of their inflation projections for 2013 is 0.9 to 1.0 percent, rising to 1.4 to 1.6 percent for next year and to between 1.7 and 2.0 percent in 2016.   
Let me now return to our decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases.  When we began 
the asset  purchase program in September 2012, we said that we would continue purchases until 
the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially in a context of price stability.  Since then, we have seen meaningful cumulative progress in the labor  market.  For example, since we 
began the current purchase program, the economy has added about 2.9 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen by more than a  percentage point, to 7 percent.  For comparison, 
when we started the program, many forecasters saw the unemployment rate remaining near 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 31  8 percent throughout  2014.  Recent economic indicators have increased our confidence that the 
job market gains will con tinue.  For example, nonfarm payrolls have recently been increasing at 
a pace of about 200,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.6 percentage 
point since June.  With fiscal restraint likely diminishing and with signs that household spending is picking up, we expect economic growth to be strong enough to support further job gains.  Further, FOMC participants now see the risks around their forecasts of growth and unemployment as having become more nearly balanced, rather than tilted in  an unfavorable 
direction as they were at the inception of the asset purchase program.   
As you know, we have been purchasing $85 billion per  month in longer -term Treasury 
and agency mortgage -backed securities.  Starting in January, we will be purchasing $75 billion 
of securities a month, reducing purchases of Treasuries and m ortgage -backed securities by 
$5 billion each.  It is important to note though that, even after this reduction, we will be still 
expanding our holdings of longer -term securities at a ra pid pace.  We will also continue to roll 
over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in to agency mortgage -backed 
securities.  Our sizable and sti ll-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on 
longer -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more 
accommodative, which in turn should promote further progress in the labor market and help move inflation back toward the Committee’s objective  of 2 percent.   
Our modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases reflects  the Committee’s  belief that 
progress toward its economic objectives will be sustained.  If the incoming data broadly support 
the Committee ’s outlook for  employment and inflation , we will likely reduce the pace of 
securities purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  Of course, continued progress 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 31  is by no means certain .  Consequently, future adjustments to the pace of asset purc hases  will be 
deliberate and dependent on incoming information .  Asset purchases remain a useful tool that we 
are prepared to deploy as needed to meet our objectives. 
With unemployment still well above its longer -run normal rate, which Committee 
participan ts currently estimate to be between 5.2 and 5.8 percent, and with inflation continuing to 
run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -term objective, highly accommodative monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  To emphasize its commitment to provide a high le vel of monetary 
accommodation for as long as needed, the FOMC today also enhanced its forward guidance.  For 
the past year, the Committee has said that the current low target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at least as long as the une mployment rate remained above 6 ½ percent, 
inflation was projected to be no more than half a percentage point above our 2 percent longer -run 
goal, and longer -term inflation expectations remained well anchored.  We have emphasized that 
these numbers are thre sholds, not triggers, meaning that crossing a threshold would not lead 
automatically to an increase in the federal funds rate but would indicate only that it was appropriate for the Committee to consider whether the broader economic outlook justified such an increase.  With many FOMC participants now projecting that the 6 ½ percent unemployment 
threshold will be reached by the end of 2014, the Committee decided to provide additional information about how it expects its policies to evolve after th e threshold is crossed.  
Based on its assessment of current conditions and the outlook, which is informed by a 
range of indicators, including measures of labor market conditions, financial conditions, and inflation pressures, the Committee now anticipates it will like ly be appropriate to maintain the 
current federal funds rate target well past the time that the unemployment rate  declines to below 
6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below its 2 percent goal.  In part , 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 31  this expectation reflects  our assessment, based on a comprehensive set of indicators, that there 
will still be a substantial amount of slack in the labor market when the unemployment rate falls 
to 6½ percent.  This continuing job market slack imposes heavy costs on the unemployed and the underemployed and their families and reduces our nation’s productive capacity, warranting our ongoing highly accommodative policy.  But, as the last phrase of the enhanced guidance underscores, the prospects for inflation provide another reason to keep policy accommodative.  The Committee is determined to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high, and it anticipates keeping rates low at least until it sees inflation clearly moving back toward its 2 percent objective. 
Our forward guidance is reflected in Committee participants’ latest projections for the 
path of the federal funds rate.  Although the central tendency of the projected unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of next year encompasses 6 ½ percent, 15 of 17 FOMC participants do not 
expect a rate increase before 2015.  Most see our target for the federal funds rate as rising only modestly in 2015, while 3 do not see an increase until 2016.  For all participants, the median 
projection for the federal funds rate is 75 basis points at the end of 2015 and 1.75 percent at the 
end of 2016.  
In summary, reflecting cumulative progress and an improved outlook for the job market, 
the Committee decided today to modestly reduce the monthly pace at which it  is adding to the 
longer -term securities on  its balance sheet .  If incoming information supports the Committee’s 
expectation of further progress toward its objectives, the Committee is likely to reduce the pace of monthly purchases in further measured steps in  future meetings.  However, th e process will be 
deliberate and data- dependent; asset purchases are not on a preset course.  The FOMC also 
provided additional guidance on future short -term interest rates, stating that it expects to 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 31  maintain the federal funds target in its current near -zero range well past the time that the 
unemployment rate falls below 6 ½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run 
below 2 percent.  The Federal Reserve’s enhanced guidance about its policy intentions and i ts 
substantial and still- increasing holdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary 
policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with the pursuit of its mandated objectives of 
maximum employment and price stability.  
Thank you.  I’ll be glad to take your questions.  
YLAN MUI.  Thank you .  Ylan Mui  with  the Washington Post .  Today was the first  
reduction in asset purchases , and you just said that future reductions will likely occur in 
measured steps , but are not on a  predetermined course.  Can you tell us any  more about the 
framework that you all plan  to use to determine the size and the timing of t hose reductions ?  And 
previously  you had said that you expect the program to end altogether by the middle of next year .  
Is that still a likely scena rio? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I said, the steps that we take will be dat a-
dependent.  If we ’re making progress in terms of inflation and continue d job gains —and I 
imagine we ’ll continue to do, probably at  each meeting , a measured reduction—t hat would take 
us to late in the year , certainly not by the middle of the year.  If the economy slows for some 
reason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or two.  On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we co uld go a bit faster , but my expectation is for 
similar moderate steps going forward throughout most of 2014. 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  When you say 
“similar moderate steps going forward, ” is $10 billion an increment that people should 
anticipate ?  And is equal amounts of mortgage -back ed securities and T reasuries also what one 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 31  should anticipate?  Finally, when you say “ well pas t” the unemployment rate of 6½ percent, why 
not pick a number ?  Why say “well pas t”?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Sure .  On the first issue of $10 billion, again, we say we are 
going to  take further modest steps subsequently , so that would be the general range .  But again, I 
want to emphasi ze that we are going to be data- depen dent.  We could s top purchases if the 
economy disappoints .  We could pick them up somewhat if the economy is st ronger .1   
In terms of MBS versus T reasuries, we discussed that issue.  I think that the general sense 
of the C ommittee was that equal reductions , or approximately equal reductions , was the simpler 
way to do this .  It obviously doesn’ t make a great deal of difference in the end to how much we 
hold.  So that was going to be our strategy . 
On the issue  of another number, the unemployment rate —let ’s talk first about the labor 
market condition.  The unemployment rate is a good indicator of  the labor market .  It’s probably 
the best single indicator that we have .  And so we were comfortable setting a 6.5 percent 
unemployment rate as the point at which we would begin to look at a more broad set of labor 
market indicators .  However, precisely because we don’ t want to look just at the unemployment 
rate, we want to —once we get to 6½—we want to look at hiring, quits, vacancies, participation, 
long-term unemployment, et cetera, wages .  We couldn ’t put it in terms of another 
unemployment  rate level , specifically .  So, I expect there w ill be some time pas t the 6½ percent 
before all of the other variables that we’ll be  looking at will line up in a way that will give us 
confidence that the labor market is strong enough to withstand the beginning of increases in 
rates .   
                                                           
1 The Chairman meant to say:   “We could stop the reductions in the pace of purchases if the economy 
disappoints.   We could reduce the pace of purchases somewhat more quickly if the economy is stronger.”  
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 31  The SEP, the Survey of Economic Projections , which were distributed, obviously that ’s 
individual assessments and not the C ommittee ’s collective view .  But nevertheless, it gives you 
some sense of current expectations about the length of time .  The SEP shows that the 6.5 percent 
is expected by a large number of people to be reached about  at the end of next year, end of 2014.  
And then the first rate increases , according t o the so- called dots c hart, take place near the end of 
2015.  So that ’s the order of the magnitude , I think , that people are currently expecting , but again 
I emphasize that it will depend on our  being persuaded that —over , across a  broad range of 
indicators —the labor market is sufficiently strong that we could begin to withdraw 
accommodation.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Jo n Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, as  
you we ll know, the F ed is going through a transition next month.  Can you talk about the role 
that Janet Yellen played in formulating the policy that’ s being laid out today , and what kind of 
consistency the public can expect as we go into her tenure , assuming she ’s confirmed , with the 
program that you’ re laying out today ?  W ill it carry on under  her leadership?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Yes, it will.  I have always consulted closely with Janet, 
even well before she was named by the P resident , and I consulted closely with her on these 
decisions as well .  And she fully supports what we did today.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, your 
inflation forecasts never get back to 2 percent in the time horizon that you cover here , out to 
2016.  Given t hat, why should we believe the F ed has a symmetric inflation target ?  And, in 
particular, why should we believe you’ re following an optimal policy —optimal  control policy , as 
you’ve said in the past —given that that would imply inflation going a bit above target at some 
point ?  Thank you.  
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 31  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , again, these are individual estimates, there are big 
standard errors implicitly around them and so on.  We do think that inflation will grad ually move 
back to 2 percent , and we allow for the possibility , as you know , in our guidance that it could go 
as high as 2½ percent .  Even though inflation has been quite low in 2013, let me give you the 
case for why inflation might rise .   
First, there ar e some special factors , such as health -care costs and some other things , that 
have been unusually low and might be reversed.  Secondly, if you look at the fundamentals for 
inflation , incl uding inflation expectations , whether measured by financial markets o r surveys ; if 
you look at growth, which we now anticipate w ill be picking up bot h in the U .S. and 
internationally; if you look at wages , which have been growing at 2 percent and a little bit higher 
according to many indicators —all of these things suggest that inflation will gradually pick up.   
But what I tried to emphasize in my opening remarks , and which is clear in our statement , is that 
we take this very seriously .  It’s not easy to —inflation cannot be picked up and move d where 
you want it .  It takes —it requires , obviously , some luck and some good policy .  But we are very 
committed to making sure that inflation does not stay too low , and we are continuing to monitor 
that very carefully and to take whatever actions necessary to achieve that.  
ROBIN HARDING.  And on optimal control ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, even under optimal control, it would take a while for 
inflation —inflation is quite —can be quite inertial .  It can take quite a  time to move .  And the 
responsi veness  of inflation to increasing economic activity is quite low .  So—and particularly 
given an environment where we have falling oil prices and other factors that are contributing 
downward forces on inflation, i t’s difficult to get inflation to move quickly to target .  But we are, 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 31  again , committed to doing what’ s necessary to get inflation back to target over the next couple of 
years.  
CRAIG TORRES .  Craig Torres from Bloomberg News .  There ’s been a great deal of 
discussion in your profession about the potency of  policy at the zero boundary .  And to kind of 
bounce off Robin, it ’s very striking that inflation has fallen  while QE3 has been in place , and the 
economy continues to undershoot the FOMC ’s forecast .  So, I guess the simple question is, are 
you giving up?  Y ou know, I mean, have you reached the limit of your policy tools , and is there 
nothing more you can do ?  The economy is still running way below the trend line that existed 
before the financial crisis.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, everything depends on what benchmark you compare 
it to, as you know .  I said last year that monetary  policy was not a panacea .  It couldn ’t solve all 
our problems .  And , in particular, it can ’t do anything about a slowing in potential growth, which 
appears to have happen ed, at least to some extent .  It can ’t do much or anything about fiscal 
policy , which is working in quite the opposite direction.  So, given those things, I think the 
outcomes we ’ve had are perhaps not as bad as you would—might think .  In particular, as I ’ve 
mentioned many times, the Congressional Budget Office assessed the fiscal drag in 2013 as 
being about  1½ percentage points of growth.  We ’re looking like we ’re going to get in the low 2s 
actual growth .  Add those numbers t ogether, it ’s kind of a counter factual .  It says th at monetary  
policy a ppears to have succeeded in off setting a good bi t of that fiscal drag , which we were not 
at all sure that we could accomplish .  So, we ’re certainly not giving up.  We intend to maintain a 
highly accommodative policy .  Nothing tha t we did today was intended to reduce 
accommodation .  We ’re still going to be buying assets at a high rate and increasing and 
holding —increasing our balance sheet and holding on to those assets .  In our guidance today —
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 31  we strengthen ed our guidance to make clear that we expect to keep rates low well beyond the 
point that  unemployment hits 6½ percent.  
PETER BARNES .  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, sir .  Was it a close call in the discussion 
today among participants and members of —given all you’ ve said about the outlook and your 
forecast, was there a lot a of debate on whether or not to go ahead and start tapering now or wait 
longer —wait for more data?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well , certainly, it ’s a very —it was a very important 
decision , and we debated it quite extensively .  That being said, the question we asked  ourselves 
was, did we feel comfortable that —to say that we had met , or were at least  well on the way 
toward s meeting , the criterion we set when we began the program in September of 2012?   And 
that criterion , of course , was a substantial  improvement in the outlook for the labor market .  And 
if you look at the cumulative improvement —and I mentioned some figures in my opening 
remarks —or if you look at recent numbers , either on employ ment, unemployment.  And also in 
terms of growth, we ’re seeing encouraging numbers in terms of household spending , for 
example, auto purchases, fiscal drag is reduced, stronger numbers internationally .  Now, I don’ t 
want to overstate the case.  As you look at our projections, you’ ll see we only assume or project 
a small pickup in growth going into next year .  But there was a pretty widespread view that there 
was a reasonable expectation , first , that the recent gains in the labor market would continue —
and, remember, we ’re just beginning this process now, so by the time we complete this process, I 
think it ’s very likely that we ’ll easily pass the hurdle of a substantial improvement in the outlook 
for the labor market .  Now, it is true that while we have pass ed the—or , made significant 
progress on the labor market and growth hurdles, there is still this question about inflation, which is a bit of a concern —more than a bit of concern, as we indicated in our statement .  Our outlook 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 31  is still for inflation to go b ack to 2 percent .  I gave you some reasons why I think that will 
happen.  But we take that very seriously , and if inflation does not show signs of returning to 
target, we will take appropriate action.  
REBECCA JARVIS .  Hi, there.  Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News .  Mr. Chairman, now that 
you have introduced tapering into the system, if the economy were to stumble again in the future, 
would you recommend, or have you discussed with your colleagues , increasing bond buying in 
the future ?  And have you considered any alternative measures —for example, more direct 
stimulus directly into the economy if it were to stumble again?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  What kind of direct stimulus do you have in mind?  
REBECCA JARVIS .  Well, any type of stimulus that you would not be essentiall y 
buying it back from the banks. 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, in terms of the legal authorities that the Federal 
Reserve has, we don ’t have some of the — 
REBECCA JARVIS .  If you  could ask for it.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  If we could ask for it .  Well, we ’re getting  now to a fanciful  
discussion, I think.  I think our basic tools are asset purchases , and we are allowed only to buy 
Treasuries and agency securities .  We are not allowed to buy corporates or other things , the way 
many central banks are.  We have—with interest rates near zero, we can manage our forward 
guidance, and I think that has been helpful, that ’s been effective.  We probably could do more 
with that.  But there are limits to that as well because , beyond a certain point, markets may not 
accept —you know, may not view the long -distance , way -ahead guidance as being credible.  We 
can change the interest rate we pay on r eserves , which is something we ’ve talked about .   
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 31  The other kind of thing that —the only other thing I can think of that amounts to a dir ect 
infusion into the economy , if you will, is action similar to the British F unding for Lending 
program , where they provided cheap funding to banks if the banks could show that they had 
increased their lending to households or small businesses .  We could, in  principle , do something 
like that, and we ’ve looked at that because we do have a discount window where we lend to 
banks .  However , somewhat differently from what was going on in the U .K. and in Europe , here, 
our banks are fl ush with liquidity, they have plenty of cash on hand—they ow n lots of reserves , 
of course .  And so our sense was that the re just wouldn’ t be any take up on that program , at least 
under current conditions .  We do not have the authority to lend directly to small businesses or 
other typ es of institutions .  And in any case, I don’ t think right now that tight credit, in most 
areas , is the major problem.  I think what we have , in many cases , is that firms are either not 
looking for credit or their balance sheets are not strong enough that they pass creditworthy  
screen ings at the bank .  So we do have a range of things that we can do, but we are already 
being, I think, pretty aggressive.  
REBECC A JARVIS .  And w ould you increase the bond purchases?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Under some circumstances, yes.  
GREG IP .  Greg Ip of t he Economist .  I have a narrow question and a related broader 
question.  The narrow question is, did the changeover in leadership play any role in the decision 
on when to begin tapering, i.e., at this meeting ?  For example, did you have a preference, all else 
equal , to get it started before you left ?  The related broader question is , you are a historian of 
monetary policy .  What do you think future historians of monetary policy will have to say about 
your eight years at the Federal Reserve helm?  
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 31  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  The answer t o the first question is “ no.”  The answer t o the 
second question is “ I’ll be interested to see .”  I hope I live long enough to read the textbooks .  
The—what we’ ve showed—there’ ve been two big changes , at least —more than two, but two 
that I would cite at the Fed in the last few years, of course, the result , in many ways , of the crisis .  
The first is  that the Fed eral Reserve has rediscovered its roots , in the sense that the F ed was 
created to stabilize the financial system in times of panic .  And we did that , and we used tools 
that we re analogous in spirit to what central banks have done for many hundreds  of years , but, of 
course, adapted to a modern financial system.  
The other thing that was unique about —maybe not completely unique, but largely unique 
about this period was that we were trying to help the economy recover from a deep recession at a 
time when interes t rates were almost , or essentially , zero .  And that required us to use other 
methods —most prominently , forward  guidance and asset purchases , neither of which is entirely 
new.  But , clearly , this is —unless you put aside the D epression , where monetary policy was , on 
the whole , pretty passive —this is the first—one of the first examples , at least , of aggressive 
monetary policy taking place in a near -zero interest rate environment .  Now we ’re seeing , of 
course , Japan and the U.K. and other countries also taking similar types of approaches .  And I 
think that will be an issue —an area that monetary historians will be interested in exploring , as 
well as monetary theorists  and empirical studies.  
JASON LANGE .  Jason Lange with Reuters .  Chairman B ernanke, today , with one hand, 
you’re giving the economy something by telling us that or signaling that you may keep interest 
rates lower for longer than we previously thought .  But with the other hand, you’re taking 
somet hing away by reducing the large -scale asset purchases .  If you think that , overall, this is 
maintaining the level of monetary accommodation steady, is that a sign that the decision to 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 31  reduce the asset purchases is relatively less about an improved outlook for the economy and 
perhaps more  about the concern that the asset purchases are less effective or might be f ueling 
bubbles ?  Thank you.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as I said before, asset purchases are a supplementary 
tool.  Our main tool is interest rate policy .  The reason that asset pur chases are a supplementary 
tool is because it ’s a much less familiar tool.  We have less ability to calibrate how big the effects 
are, for example.  And it ’s also true that , as the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve gets large, 
managing that balance sheet, exiting from that balance sheet become more difficult .  And there 
are concerns about effects on asset prices, although, I would have to say that ’s another thing that 
future monetary economist s will want to be looking at very carefully .  So, our view was —in 
September 2012—was that we had interest rates already low, and they were expected to stay low for a good long time .  The economy, though, was faltering .  We needed an additional boost .  And 
so we brought in the asset purchase program again .  We put in a specific objective, which is 
substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market .  Our sense was once that 
intermediate objective was attained —that is, when the economy had grown and was moving 
forward —that , at that point , we could begin to wind down the secondary tool, the supplementary 
tool, and achieve essentially the same amount of accommodation using interest rates and for ward  
guidance.   
And so, I do want to reiterate that this is not intended to be a tightening .  We don’ t think 
that there ’s an inflation problem or anything like that.  On the one hand, asset purchases are still 
going to be continuing , we’re still going to be building our bal ance sheet .  The total amount of 
assets that we acquire are probably more than  was—certainly more than what  was expected in 
September 2012 or in June 2013.  So we ’ll have a very substantial balance sheet , which we ’ll 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 31  continue to hold.  And now we ’ve also clarified our guidance that we will be keeping rates low 
well pas t unemployment of 6.5 percent .  So we ’re trying here to get a high level of 
accommodation .  It is true that the purchases are —we view as supplementary to the interest rate 
policy .  But, again, the action today is intended to keep the level of accommodation more or less 
the same overall and eno ugh to push the economy forward.  
VICTORIA MCGRANE .  Victoria McGrane, Dow Jones .  In an earlier response, you 
sort of laid out the argument against —or sort of explain ed why the C ommittee didn ’t lower the 
6.5 percent unemployment threshold.  Is that convers ation over ?  Have you all put off the table 
changing those thresholds ?  Has there been any other further discussion on perhaps adding a 
lower bound to the inflation target as well ?  And then, specifically on inflation, w hat tools or 
actions could the C ommittee take if inflation continues to run below your target or even falls 
further?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, I think we want to make an assessment now .  I 
wouldn’ t expect any changes in the very near term .  We want to see how much accommodation 
we have and w hether it ’s sufficient , whether the economy is continuing to grow, a nd inflation is 
moving back toward  target , as we anticipate.  But there are things we can do .  We can strengthen 
the guidance in various ways .  And while the view of the C ommittee was that the best way 
forward today was in this more qualitative approach, which incorporates elements both of the 
unemployment th reshold and the inflation floor, t hat further strengthening would be possible , 
and it ’s something that has  certainly not been ruled out .  And , of course, asset purchases are still 
there to be used .  We do have tools to manage a large balance sheet .  We ’ve made a lot of 
progress on that .  So while , again, while we think that we can provide a high level of 
accommodation with a somewhat slo wer pace—but still very high pace —of asset purchases and 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 31  our interest rate policy , we do have other things we can do if we need to ramp up again.  That 
being said, we ’re hopeful that the economy will c ontinue to make progress , and that we ’ll begin 
to see the whites of the eyes of the end of the recovery and the beginning of the more normal 
period of economic growth. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Some members of your staff published a paper earlier this 
fall arguing that in times of high unemployment— and, particularly , when some of that 
unemployment is calcifying into disengagement —there’ s an argument for monetary policy to be 
even more aggressive .  And yet you are now announcing that you’ ll do less rather than more .  
The Fed has  done that twice before and both times has regretted the decision.  Ca n you talk about 
why you are not erring on the side of doing more?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, again , we’re not doing less .  We ’ll see how 
accommodation shapes up .  But while we are slowing asset purchases a bit,  again , we expect the 
total balance sheet to be quite large and maintained for —at a large level for a long time .  And we 
expect to keep rates low for a very long time.  We ’re providing a great deal of accommodation to 
the economy .  I agree with your observation, and the observation of the paper that you cited, that 
there is a case for being particularly aggressive, and I think we ha ve been aggressive to try to 
keep the economy growing , and we are seeing progress in the labor market .  So I would disput e 
the idea that we ’re not providing a lot of accommodation to the economy.  
WYATT ANDREW S.  Mr. Chairman , thank you . Wyatt Andrews at CBS .  Given the 
billions of dollars that the Fed has put into the economy over the years, do you see a leading reason why t he economy has not created more jobs?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So, we’ve been in a —it’ s been about a little over four years 
now since the recovery began, four and a half years .  It’s been a slow recovery .  There are a 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 31  number of reasons for that .  It’s—of course , that ’s something for econometricians and historians 
to grapple with, but there have been a number of factors which have contributed to slower 
growth .  They include, for example, the observation that  financial cris es tend to disrupt the 
economy, may a ffect innovation, new products, new f irms.  We had a big housing bust, a nd so, 
the construction sector, of course, has been quite depressed for a while .  We ’ve had continuing 
financial disturbances in Europe and elsewhere .  We’ve had very tight , on the whole —except for 
in 2009—we had very tight fiscal policy .  People don’ t appreciate how tight fiscal policy has 
been .  At this stage in the last recession , which wa s a much milder recession, state, local, and 
federal governments had hired 400,000 additional workers from the trough of the recession.  At the same point in this recovery , the change in state, local, and federal government workers is 
minus 600,000.  So there ’s about a million workers difference  in how many people are —have 
been employed at all levels  of government .  So, fiscal policy has been tight , contractiona ry, so 
there have been a lot of head winds.  All that being said, we have  been disappointed in the pace of 
growth , and we don ’t fully understand why .  Some of it may just be a slower pace of underlying 
potential, at least temporarily .  Producti vity has been disappointing .  It may be that there ’s been 
some bad luck—for example, the effects of the European crisis and the like .  But compared to 
other advanced industrial countries —Europe, the U.K., Japan —compared to other countries and 
advanced  industrial countries reco vering from financial crise s, the U.S. recovery has actually 
been better than most .  It’s not been good, i t’s not been satisfactory .  Obviously, we still have a 
labor market where it ’s not easy for people to find work.  A lot of young people can’ t get the 
experience and entr ée into the labor market .  But, I think, given all of  the things that we faced , 
it’s perhaps , at least in retrospect, not shocking that the recovery has been somewhat tepid. 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 31  GREG ROBB .  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.com .  You just talked a little 
bit about fiscal policy and now Congress has —is set to pass a budget deal , and they haven ’t 
really done much to reduce the deficit .  And it looks like they ’re not going to do anything until 
after the next presidential election .  So, could you talk a little bit about that ?  You’ve been 
pressing for a bigger deal and reducing the U.S. debt burden.  Thanks.  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, as always, of course, I don ’t address specific fiscal 
actions .  I will say a couple of things about this deal .  One is that , relative to where we were in 
September and October, it certainly is nice that there’ s been a bipartisan deal , and that it looks 
like it’ s going to pass both hous es of Congress .  It’s also, at least directionally, what I have 
recommended in testimony , which is that it eases a bit the fiscal restra int in the next couple of 
years, a  period where the economy needs help to finish the recovery .  And, in place of that , it 
achieves savings further out in the 10- year window .  So those things  are po sitive things .  Of 
course, there’ s a lot more work to be done , I have no doubt about that .  But it’s  certainly a better 
situation than we had in September and October , or in Janua ry during the fiscal cliff , for that 
matter .  And I think it will be good for confidence if fiscal policy and c ongressional leaders work 
together to —even if there’ s—even if the outcomes are small , as this one was, it’ s a good thing 
that they are working cooperatively and making some progress.  
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Bernanke, Donna Borak with American Banker .  As you 
look back on the regulatory reform effort over the last several years —the rules that have been 
completed , those  that have yet to be finalized —what rules would you have like d to have seen 
tougher ?  And one s that, perhaps , you would have  liked to have  seen finished before you leave?  
And as someone that ha s been a steward of the financial crisis and the reform effort, as you leave 
now, do you fee l that the safeguards are now in place , that the system is safer?  
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 31  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Yes , the system is certainly safer , and one indication of that 
is the amount  of capital that large banks hold.  So, for example, on the capital side, we have 
imposed Basel III  requirements, much tougher requirements , as you know, for the large banks , 
with surcharges that will be part of that process .  We’ve imposed— I think one of the main 
innovations , which I am very pleased with , is the use of stress testing , trying to see whether 
banks have enough capital not only to deal with normal fluctuations, but to deal with the  very 
severe combination of a sharp downturn in the economy and very bad fi nancial conditions .  And 
I think that has been a very important test, both of banks ’ abilities to survive a bad situation but 
also their abilities to measure their risk s, which was something that was very deficient going into 
the crisis .  Beyond that, we ’re looking at a leverage ratio, of course, that we expect to complete 
fairly so on, the possibility of having debt required at the holding company to assist in a 
resolution, we ’re looking a t capital for —to backstop firms that rely heavily on short -term 
wholesale funding .  So there’s a much stronger capital -oriented drive at this point  to strengthen 
our financial system —and th at’s just one dimension.  A nd then there’s  liquidity  and many other 
aspects .  I think, you know, it ’s not really up to me to say whether these things are tough enough 
or not .  I mean , you and other observers who are writing about this and thinking about this 
obviously will have your opinions .  But, I guess, what I would say about that is that we ’re not 
done .  We have still some important rules to complete, although all of them are well advanced .  
And as we get the se rules done and implement them , I’m sure they ’ll make a very substantial 
difference in the safety of the system , but whether more needs to be done —I’ll leave that as an 
open question, and I think we ’ll be working on this for some time. 
PETER COOK .  Peter  Cook of Bloomberg Television.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, thank 
you for holding these news conferences .  I hope you encourage your successor to have even 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 31  more of them .  One thing I know you’ re going to miss is traveling to Capitol Hill to testify , and 
one thing that ’s going to be happening next year , according to the chairman of the House 
Financial Services Committee , is a full review of the Federal Reserve— even the Federal Reserve 
Act, the structure of the Fed, the mission of the Fed, and the mandate of the Fed .  And I wanted 
to see if you might be willing to impart some final words of wisdom to members of Congress as 
they consider possible legislative changes .  What , if anything , could they do to the structure of 
the Federal Reserve, the mandate of the F ederal Reserve—the dual mandate—that might help 
Fed policy makers in the future ?  Do you think the dual mandate still is merited ?  And just a final 
question for you, sir , as you get set to leave and perhaps your last news conference here —you 
talked a little bit about your frustrations, the headwinds that you face d through the course of your 
eight years .  Is there a decision —with the benefit of hindsight —that you would do differently, 
one change perhaps in a decision making process that you’ ve made, your fell ow colleagues have 
made here, that you think would have made a difference mater ially over the last eight years?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, on the centennial review, let me just say , first, that  
one of the things that I ’m proud of , and I ’ve tried to accomplish over the past eight years , is to 
increase the transparency of the Fed and to increase the accountability of the Fed .  You 
mentioned those trips to Capitol Hill.  I ’ve testified many times , as have a number of my 
colleagues .   
There is this notion that  the Fed is not audited or i t has all kinds of secret books —all 
these things .  As you well know, we have complete openness to the General Accountability 
Office, the GAO —Government Accountability Office .  We have an IG, Inspector Ge neral , of 
our own.  We have a private accounting firm that does all the books as well under very tough 
standards .  We publish regular reports on all aspects of our operations .  So we ’re very open , and 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 31  we are by all means willing to work with Congress to se e if there ’s anything that they think 
might be done better or in a more effective way .  So, we’re open to doing that .   
I hope that those reviewing the central b ank will, of course, recognize that central 
banking is an old activity .  The 17th century is when the Swedish Riksbank and the Bank of 
England began operation, so we know a lot about central banking .  There are a lot of experts on 
central banking, a lot of experts on monetary policy .  Every major country has a central bank .  So 
we’re not starting from scratch .  I mean , there  are a lot of people with a lot of expertise on this , 
and I hope that , as we talk about these issues , that we are bringing in serious people who 
understand these issues and who can make good suggestions .   
Now, there are a range of different mandates around the world .  There are some single 
mandates , there are some dual mandates, et cetera.  It’s our sense that the dual mandate has 
served us well here—in particular , that the Fed has been able, at times , to spe ed the recovery 
from recession and help put people back to work more quickly .  Of course, we can ’t do anything 
about long -run employment opportunities , but we can help the economy recover more quickly .  
So I think that that ’s valuable.  I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn ’t 
really matter whether we have one mandate or two , because we’ re below our inflation target and 
we—unemployment is above where we ’d like it to be .  So both sides of our mandate are pointing 
exactly in the same direction , which is to provide strong accommodation to the economy to help 
it recover .   
Looking in retrospect , I—you know, that ’s a very hard question.  Every decision you 
make, of course , is done in real time , with deficient information and whatever you know at the 
time and whatever the experts are telling you about any particular issue.  Obviously, we were 
slow to recognize the crisis .  I was slow to recognize the crisis .  In retrospect, it was a traditional 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 31  classic crisis, but in a very, very different  guise:  different types of financial instruments, 
different types o f institutions, which made it , for a historian like me , more difficult to see .  
Whether or not we could have prevented or done more about it, that ’s another question.  You 
know, by the time I became C hairman , it was already 2006 , and house prices were already 
declining .  Most of the mortgages had  been made, but , obviously, it would have been good to 
have recognized that earlier and try to take more preventive action .  That being said, we ’ve done 
everything we can think of , essentially , to strengthen the Fed ’s ability to monitor the financial 
markets, to take actions to stabilize the econ omy and the financial system .  So, I think, going 
forward, we ’re much better prepared for —to deal with these kinds of events than we were when 
I became C hairman in 2006. 
KEVIN HALL .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  Kevin Hall with McClatchy Newspapers .  I 
want to indulge in  a local question and a broader question.  A s the paper that  owns the South 
Carolina papers , I think there ’s a lot of interest as to whether you’ re going to retire to Dillon, 
South Carolina , and write your kiss -and-tell book.  B ut do you envision any role for yourself in 
South Carolina , post -chairmanship?  And then the broader question— your pred ecessor, Dr. 
Greenspan, in his new book ar gues that long -term investment—one of the reasons we may be 
seeing such a slow economy is that people are afraid debt and deficits are reducing long -term 
investment .  People are —companies are investing in the sorts  of things that make them leaner, 
get by with fewer people , but the kind of expansion, we ’re not seeing .  Do you feel that debt and 
deficits are weighing down these sorts of long -term decisionmaking , and does it argue for m ore 
drastic action on the short -term?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Let me ask you, do you own the Charlotte Observer ? 
KEVIN HALL .  Yes.  
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 31  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Ah .  So, most of my family now is in North Carolina , and 
I’ve got a number of family members in Charlotte and also in Durham .  So my wife and  I are 
going to spend the Christmas vacation in North Carolina .  I still have —my uncle still lives in 
Dillon .  He ’s 85, and very, very, very chipper .   
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  [Inaudible  remark ] 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  O kay, good.   
But I think for the immediate future, my wife and I, I believe , will stay in Washington for 
a bit of time .   
About investment, I think there are a lot of reasons why investment is weaker than we 
would like .  I think the first and most important reason is , the recovery is slow .  I mean, 
investment is driven by sales, by the need for capac ity.  And, you know, with a slow -growing 
GDP, slow- growing economy , most firms do not yet feel that much pressure on their capac ity to 
do major, new projects .  There’ s also a var iety of uncertainties out there —fis cal, regulatory, tax , 
and so on—that no doubt affect  some of these calculations .  We hear that from our FOMC 
participants around the table as they report from their local D istricts .  So I think there are a lot of 
factors.  
Usually, you think that the way that a deficit or a long -term debt would affect investment 
would be through what ’s called “crowding out ”—that is,  raising interest rates .  But high interest 
rates —we may have many problems , but high interest rat es is not our problem right now .  
There’ s plenty of —particularly for larger firms —there’ s plenty of credit available at low interest 
rates .  And we intend, of course, to try to continue to provide that to help the economy grow and 
to stimulate investment spending .  But I think that  it’s going to take faster overall growth to get 
firms trying to expand capacity , and I think if we —if consumer spending increases , as we think it 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 25 of 31  will, and if exports increase, as they seem to be doing, then we ’ll probably see greater investment 
as well.  
STEVE BECKNER .  Steve Beckner of MNI .  Mr. Chairman, it ’s been a pleasure 
covering you.  One of the factors that your policy statement says will be considered in assessing 
the future pace of asset purchases is the cost and efficacy of those purchases .  To what extent has 
the—or y ou might say , cost and benefits —to what extent has t hat calculation already changed ?  
To what extent did that affect today ’s decision ?  And, going forward , looking on the cost side, 
somebody else mentioned bubbles .  Not just bubbles , but to what extent will, you know, the 
whole consideration of threats to financial stability come into play , as well as the potential for 
losses on the Fed’ s own portfolio ? 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  So I will answer your question, and I’ll try and help maybe 
do a better job on Binya ’s question as well .  We do think, again , of the asset purchases as a 
secondary tool behind interest rate policy , and we do think that the cost –benefit ratio , particularly 
as the assets on the balance sheet get large, that it moves in a way that’ s less favorable.  The 
costs involved include, you know, managing the exi t from that.  The possible —it’ s very unlikely 
that the Fed will have losses in any comprehensive sense.  We ’ve already put $350 billion of 
profits back to the T reasury since 2009, which is about as much as we delivered to the T reasury 
between 1990 and 2007 combined.  So, over any period of time, clearly , the Fed is actually 
making a good bit of money for the taxpayer and for the government .  But it could be  that if 
interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the T reasury for a couple of years , and that would create problems , no doubt , for the Fed in 
terms of c ongressional response .   
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 26 of 31  There are issues  of how well we understand and can manage the effects of asset 
purchases .  I think, for example, that an important difference between asset purchases and 
interest rate policy is that asset purchases work by affecting what is called the  “term premium,”  
whic h is essentially the additional part of the interest rate which investors require as 
compensation for holding longer -term securities .  We just don’ t understand very well —and  when  
I say “ we,” I mean the economic s profession—don’ t understand very well what m oves t he term 
premium .  And so, we sa w last summer —we saw a very big jump in the term premium that was 
very destabilizing and created a lot of stress in financial markets .  So there are a number of 
reasons why asset purchases, while effective, while I thin k they have been important, are less 
attractive tools than traditional interest rate policy , and that ’s the reason why we have relied 
primarily on interest rates , but used asset purchases as a supplement when we’ ve needed it to 
keep forward progress .   
I think that, you know, obviously there are some financial stability issues involved there .  
We look at the possibility that asset purchases have led to bubbly pricing in certain markets or in 
excessive leverage or excessive risk -taking .  We don’ t think t hat that ’s happened to an extent  
which is a danger to the system , except other than that when those positions unwind, like we saw 
over the summer, they can create some bumpiness in interest rate markets , in particular .  Our 
general philosophy on financial s tability issues is , where we can,  that we try to address it first 
and foremost by making sure that the banking system and the financial s ystem are as strong as 
possible —if banks have a lot of capital , they can withstand losses , for example—a nd by using 
whatev er other tools we have to try to avoid bubbles or other kinds of financial risks .  That being 
said, I don ’t think that you can completely ignore financial stability concerns in monetary policy 
because we can ’t control them perfectly , and there may be situa tions when financial instability 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 27 of 31  has implications for our mandate, which is jobs and inflation, which we saw , of co urse, in the 
Great Recession .  So it’s a very complex issue.   
I think it will be many years before central banks have completely worked out exactly 
how best to deal with financial instability questions .  Certainly, the first line of defense for us is 
regulatory and other types of measures , but we do have to pay some attention to that .  I would 
say at this point , though, that the asset purchases program —the last one —is well on its way to 
meeting our economic objective , and I am very pleased that we ’re able to , over time , wind down 
this program, slowing the pace of purchases on current plans , because we reached our objecti ve 
rather than because the costs or efficacy issues became important .  So I think that , in this case , 
that that ’s not a concern at this juncture with respect to this program.  
ANNALYN KURTZ .  Annalyn Kurtz with CNN .  I recall in Jackson Hole  last year, you 
cited  a study that said the first $2 trillion in  asset purchases had boost ed GDP by about 3 percent 
and increased private -sector employment by 2 million jobs .  Now your balance sheet is nearin g 
$4 trillion, and I ’m wondering , do you feel the third round of  asset purchases pack ed as much 
bang for your buck?  And do you still think the first study offered a reasonable estimate?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Well, it’ s very hard to know —in terms of the study, it ’s 
very hard to know .  It’s an imprecise science to try to measure these effects .  You have to 
obviously ask yourself, you know, what would have happen ed in the absence of the policy ?  I 
think that study —I think it was a very interesting study , but it was on the upper end of the 
estimates that people have gotten i n a variety of studies looking at the effects of asset purchases .  
That being said, I ’m pretty comfortable with the idea that this prog ram did , in fact , create jobs .  I 
cited some figures .  To repeat one of them, t he Blue Chip forecast s for unemployment in this 
current quarter —made before we beg an our program —were on the order 7.8 percent , and that 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 28 of 31  was before th e fiscal cliff deal, which even —created even more fiscal headwinds for the 
economy .  And , of course, we ’re now at 7 percent .  I’m not saying that the asset purchases made 
all that difference, but it made some of the difference , and I think it has helped create jobs .   
And you can see how it works .  I mean , the asset purchases brought down long -term 
interest rates, brought down mortgage rates, brought down corporate bond yields , brought down 
car loan interest rates, and we’ ve seen the response in those areas as the economy has done 
better .  Moreover , again, this has  been done in the face of very tight, unusually tight fiscal policy 
for a recovery period.  So  I do think it ’s been effective, but the precise size of the impact is 
something I think that we can very reasonably disagree about , and that work will co ntinue on.  
As I said before, the uncertainty about the impact and the uncertainty about the effects of ending 
programs and so on is one of the reasons why we have treated this as a supplementary tool rather than as our  primary tool.  
DON LEE .  Don Lee, L.A. Times .  Unemployment benefits , as you know , are expiring  
shortly for more than a million people , and many more people will see their benefits e nd next 
year.  How much of an economic impact do you see that ha ving?  And , secondly, what effect 
would you exp ect that will have on the unemployment rate ?  Could it —if those people drop out 
of the labor force, then could that knock the employment rate down quite a bit?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Yes .  Well, obviously it has a big economic effect on those 
directly affected, you know, who a re receiving benefits , and we do have an unusually large 
number of long -term unemployed people in the United States now, which is obviously a major 
concern and one that I c ited in my opening remarks .  The effects of ending extended 
unemployment benefits , quantitatively , for the economy overall , are probably not very large 
because they work in two directions .  On the one hand, by putting the benefits into the system, 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 29 of 31  you are providing additiona l income .  That income is spent .  People receiving unemployment 
benefits obviously tend to spend a very high fraction of their income .  That is a positive fo r 
growth .  On the other side, it —probably some folks who are— can no longer qualify for 
unemployment benefits will just drop out of the labor  force, and that will bring the 
unemployment rate down , but, for some sense , the wrong reason.  So, overall , it will have —it 
could have a very small effect on the measured unemployment rate.  But, again , I think that issue 
needs to be discussed more in ter ms of the impact on those most directly affected rather than on 
the overall economy.  
KATE DAVIDSON.  Hi .  Kate Davidson from Politico .  This is a bit of a follow -up to an 
earlier q uestion .  You talked about this centennial  review of the Fed that the House is 
undertaking .  And the Fed, of course , has been under a lot of scrutiny , and you spoke recently 
about the importance of the Fed sta nding up to political pressure .  So I just wondere d what 
advice you have , or what advice you’ve already given , to Janet Yellen when it comes to dealing 
with Congress . 
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  Excellent question.  Well, I think the first thing to agree to 
is that Congress is our boss .  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency within the 
governme nt.  It’s important that we maintain our policy independence in order to be able to make 
decisions without short -term political interference .  At the same time, it’ s up to the Congress to 
set our structure , to set our mandate , and that ’s entirely legitimate , and we need to go and explain 
ourselves .  We need to explain why certain approaches are not so good or might be better .  But, 
obviously, they represent the public , and they certainly have every right to set the terms on which 
the Federal Reserve operates and so on.   
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 30 of 31  That being said, I think that we are , in fact , an effective central bank , that we are near the 
frontier in terms of transparency, in terms of the effectiveness of our policies .  We ’re highly 
respected among central bankers and other p olicymakers around the world.  And so, I hope that 
when they do review the Fed, if that ’s what they do, again, that they rely on expertise and highly 
qualified individuals who know the ins and outs of central banking and monetary policy, which 
are not simp le matters .  And it would be very interesting to have a thorough discussion of many 
of the issues involved that the Fed has  been engaged in .  But , again, I hope it will be  on a high 
level that uses  the best and most qualified people debating, you know, wha t changes , if any , are 
needed and —or, you know, what ’s being done right. 
MURREY JACOBSON.  Hi .  Murre y Jacobson with t he NewsHour .  On t he question of 
longer -term unemployment and the drop in labor force participation, how much do you see that 
as the result of structural changes  going on in the economy at this point ?  And to what extent do 
you think government can help alleviate that in this environment?  
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE .  I think a lot of the declines in the participation rate are , in 
fact, demograph ic or structural , reflecting sociological trends .  Many of the changes that we’ re 
seeing now, we were also seeing to some degree even before the crisis, and we have a number of staffers here at the Fed who have studied parti cipation rates and the like .  So I think a lot of the 
unemployment decline that we ’ve seen , contrary to sometimes what you hear, I think a lot of it 
really does come from jobs as opposed to declining participation.   
That being said, there certainly is a portion of the decline in participation , which is 
related to people dropping out of the labor force because they are discouraged, because their skills have become obsolete, because they ’ve lost attachment to the labor force , and so on.  The 
Fed can address that , to some extent , if—you know, if we ’re able to get the economy closer to 
December 18, 2013  Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 31 of 31  full employment, then some people who are discouraged or who have been unemployed for a 
long time might find that they have opportunities to rejoin the labor market .   
But I think, fundamentally , that tr aining our workforce to fit the needs of 21st -century 
industry in the world that we have today is the job of both the private educational sector and the government educational sector .  We have many strengths in our educational sector , including 
outstanding  universities , but we have a lot of weaknesses , as you know .  There are many, many 
factors that affect participation —employment, wages , and so on, but the one I think that we can 
most directly affect is the skill level of our workforce .  And that doesn’ t mean everybody  has to 
go to get a Ph .D.  People have different needs, different interests .  But that , I think, is one of the 
biggest challenges that our society faces , and if we don’ t address it, then we ’re going to see a 
larger and larger number of people who are either unemployed, underemployed, or working at very low wages , which obviously is not something we want to see.  
Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  
March 19, 2014  
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  I am pleased to join you for the first of my post -
FOMC press conferences.  Like Chairman Bernanke before me, I appreciate the opportunity 
these press conferences afford to explain the decisions of the FOMC and respond to your 
questions. 
The Federal Open Market Committee  concluded a two- day meeting earlier today.  As you 
already know from our s tatement, the Committee  decided to make another modest reduction in 
the pace of its purchases of longer -term securities.  The Committee  also updated its guidance 
regarding the likely future path of the short -term interest rates.  As I’ll explain more fully  in a 
moment, this change in our guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee ’s policy 
intentions as set forth in its recent statements; rather, the change is meant to clarify how the 
Committee  anticipates policy evolving after the unemployment r ate declines below 6 ½ percent.  
Let me explain the economic outlook that underlies these actions.  
Despite some softer recent data, the FOMC’s outlook for continued progress toward our 
goals of maximum employment and inflation returning to 2 percent remains  broadly unchanged.  
Unusually harsh weather in January and February has made assessing the underlying strength of the economy especially challenging.  Broadly speaking, however, the spending and production data, while somewhat weaker than we had expected in January, are roughly in line with our expectations as of December, the last time Committee  participants submitted economic 
projections.  In contrast, labor market conditions have continued to improve.  The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, is three -tenths lower than the data available at the time of the December 
meeting.  Further, broader measures of unemployment —such as the U -6 measure, which 
includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full -time 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 23  
 work —have fallen even  more than the headline unemployment rate over this period, and labor 
force participation has ticked up.  While the Committee  continues to monitor developments in 
global financial markets carefully, financial conditions remain broadly consistent with the 
FOMC’s objectives.  In sum, the FOMC continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the 
economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market. 
Inflation has continued to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent objective.  Given that 
longer -term inflation expectations appear to be well  anchored, and in light of the ongoing 
recovery in the United States and in many economies around the world, the FOMC continues to expect inflation to move gradually back toward its objective.  The Committee  is mindful that 
inflation running persistently below its objective could pose risks to economic performance.  The Committee  also recognizes, however, that policy actions tend to exert pressure on inflation that is 
manifest only gradually over time.  The F OMC will continue assessing incoming data carefully 
to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer -run objectives of maximum 
employment and inflation of 2 percent.  
This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submi tted in conjunction 
with this meeting by the 16 FOMC participants —4 Board members and 12 Reserve Bank 
presidents.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  The central tendency of the  unemployment rate projections has 
shifted down by about two- tenths since December and now stands at between 6.1 and 6.3 percent 
at the end of this year.  The unemployment rate is projected to reach its longer -run normal level 
by the end of 2016.  The cent ral tendency of the projections for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 to 
3 percent for 2014 and remains somewhat above that of the estimates of longer -run normal 
growth through 2016.  Meanwhile, as I noted, FOMC participants continue to see inflation 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 23  
 moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands.  The central 
tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.6 percent in 2014, rising to 1.7 to 2.0 percent in 2016. 
Let me now return to our decision to make another measured reduction in the pace of 
asset purchases.  Starting next month, we will be purchasing $55 billion of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate.  Even after today’s action takes effect, we will continue to significantly expand our holdi ngs of longer -term securities, and we will also continue 
to roll over maturing Treasury securities and reinvest principal payments from the FOMC’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in agency mortgage -backed 
securities.  These si zable and still- increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on 
longer -term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more 
accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the Committee ’s 
objective.  
The FOMC views today’s decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases as consistent 
with the decisionmaking framework laid out last December and still in place today.  As before, if incoming information broadly supports the Committee ’s expect ation of ongoing improvement in 
labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the 
Committee  will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future 
meetings.  However, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee ’s decisions about 
the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.  
Today  the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short -term 
interest rates.  As emphasized in the statement, the new guidance does not indicate any change in 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 23  
 the policy intentions of the FOMC but instead reflects changes in the conditions we face.  Let me 
explain this more fully.  
In December 2012, the Committee  first stated its guidance in terms of economic 
thresholds , stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be 
appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 ½ percent, inflation is 
projected to be no more than a half percentage point  above our longer -run goal, and longer -term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Since that time, progress in the labor market has been more rapid than we had anticipated, while inflation has been lower than the Committee  had 
expected.  Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last December the FOMC judged it appropriate to update that guidance, noting that the current target range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”  
Today  the Committee  has fur ther revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions 
as they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters.  The revised formulation starts with a general description of the factors that drive FOMC decisionmaking and then provides the FOMC’s current assessment of what those factors will likely imply for the future path of short -
term interest rates.  In particular , the Committee  states that “[ i]n determining how long to 
maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress—both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum employment 
and 2 percent inflation.”   In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the 
respective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to ¼ percent range.  
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 23  
 The FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information , including measures 
of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
readings on financial developments.  
As I’ve noted, the FOMC’s assessment  of these factors at present is consistent with the 
characterization provided in previous forward guidance.  The Committee  continues to anticipate 
that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a 
considerable time after the asset purchase program ends , especi ally if projected inflation 
continues to run below the Committee ’s 2 percent longer -run goal, and provided that longer -term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored .” 
The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset 
purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred.  The statement continues to note that in deciding on the pace for removing accomm odation, the 
Committee  will take a balanced approach to attaining its objectives.  The statement now adds the 
Committee ’s current anticipation that  “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some t ime, warrant keeping ” short -term interest 
rates “ below levels the Committee  views as normal in the longer run.”  This guidance is 
consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds ra te for most participants remaining well below longer -run normal values 
at the end of 2016.  Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer -run normal level, many cite the residual 
impacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time.  
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 23  
 In summary, the Committee ’s actions today reflect its assessment that progress in the 
labor market is continuing, but that much re mains to be done on both the jobs and inflation 
fronts.  Unemployment is still elevated, underemployment and long -term unemployment remain 
significant concerns, and inflation is running significantly below the FOMC’s objective.  These 
conditions warrant the continuation of highly accommodative policy reflected in today’s policy statement.  The Federal Reserve’s interest rate guidance and its substantial and still -increasing 
holdings of longer -term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly 
accommodative, promoting the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  
Thank you.  I’ll be glad to take your questions.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER .  Madam Chair, Marty  Cruts inger with the Associated Press.  
Could you give us a little insight in how the decision was made on dropping the 6½ percent 
numerical  target in the forward guidance?   Was there any concern expres sed that there ’s been 
criticism on forward guidance, that it’ s confusing markets , not helping t hem in some ways?  W as 
there concern expressed that perhaps it would have been better to go to jus t a lower target , say, 
6 percent?   And could you also address the concerns raised in the dissent that by dropping this , it 
lowers the commitment on fighting low inflation?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Well, as I mentioned in my statement, the reason the 
Committee  felt that the time ha d come to revise the forward guidance is not because we think it 
has not been effective.  I believe the Committee  does think it ’s been effective.  I think it ’s had a 
very useful impact in helping markets understand our expectations and  shaping their own.  But it 
is becoming —as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6½ percent , to breaching that 
threshold tha t seems like the one that is likely to be breached .  The question is :  Markets want to 
know, the public wants to understand, beyond that threshold, how will we decide what to do?  
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 23  
 So the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the 
past, even though it is qualitative information , about what we will be looking at as the 
unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds 
rate at this 0 to ¼ percent range.  And , as I said, we’ ve tried to give a general formulation of 
what we ’ll be looking at , which is :  How far are we?  How large are the shortfalls in achieving 
our goals ?  And how fast do we expect progress to be ?  Th at will be the main factors we’ ll be 
looking at.  We initially started  with an unemployment rate as a threshold.  That was easy 
enough for the Committee  to say , “With an unemployment rate above 6½ percent, we know 
we’re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our 
mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wo uldn’ t dream of raising the 
federal funds rate target. ”  
Now, the Committee  has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for 
the labor market.  I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment 
rate is probably as good a  one as I could find.  But in assessing the real st ate of slack in the labor 
market  and ultimately of in flationary pressures that might—or deflationary pressur es that could 
result from that—it’ s appropriate to look at many more things.  And that ’s why the Committee  
now states we will look at a broad range of info rmation.  So the closer we get as we narrow in on 
coming closer to the target we want to achieve, w e will be carefully considering many indicators 
of how close are we to our tar gets.  S o those are the main reasons.  
Now, you asked as well about the dissent.  President Kocherlakota felt —I believe he 
noted in his dissent  that he endorses the new guidance about the likely path of the fed eral funds 
rate after we begin to finally raise it.  And that indicates that it’ s unlikely to be back to normal 
levels for some  time , but he questions whether or not the  reformulated forward guidance shows 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 23  
 sufficient commitment of the Committee  to its 2 pe rcent inflation objective.  And I will simply 
say on my own behalf , and on behalf of the Committee , that we are fully committed to the 
2 percent inflation objective , and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period 
of time.  As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags , so, the policies we have in place, 
we think, will gradually —only gradually —move inflation back to 2 percent .  But if the 
Committee  had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I 
feel confident that the Committee  would act to prevent that. 
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen , in the 
interest rate projections made by FOMC participants that supplement your statement, there 
seems to be a slight upward drift in the expectations for rates going out to 2016.  For instance, a majority of officials see rates at 1 percent or higher in this forecast round.  In the last forecast 
round, a  majority saw officials less than 1 percent.  I wonder if you could explain why there is 
this small upward drift in expected rates among Committee  members, whether these projections 
are a good guide for the public about where rates —about the path of rates going forward, and 
also how you reconcile this upward drift with the assurances that the Committee  makes in its 
statem ent that rates will stay below normal levels well into the future.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, to my mind, there is  only very limited upward drift.  You 
know, the Committee —I think the Committee , in assessing the economy —if you compare 
today ’s assessment with December ’s, is virtually identical.  A lmost nothing has changed in the 
overall Committee  assessment of the outlook.  A s I mentioned, unemployment has come down.  
The labor market more broadly , I think, has  improved a little more tha n we might have expected , 
and that  slightly more rapid improvement in the unem ployment picture might explain —I can ’t 
speak for why  people write down what they do, but —a little bit of the upward shift in those dots.  
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 23  
 But, more generally, I think that one should not look to the dot plot , so to speak, as the 
primary way in which the Committee  wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large.  
The FOMC statement is  the device that the Committee  as a policy making group uses to express 
its opinions, a nd we have expressed a number of opinions about the likely path of rates .  In 
particular, the Committee  has endorse d the view that it anticipates it will be a considerable 
period after the asset purchase program ends before it will be appropriate to begin to raise rates.  
And, of course , on our present path, well, that ’s not utterly  preset.  We would be looking at next 
fall.  So, I think that ’s importa nt guidance.  
Looking further out, let ’s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants 
are projecting that the employmen t situation —that the unemployment rate will be close to their 
notions of mandate -consistent or  longer -run normal levels.  What you see, I think, if you look 
this time —if you gaze at the picture from December or September , which is the first year that we 
showed those dot plots for the end of 2016, is the massiv e points that are notably below w hat the 
partici pants believe is the normal longer -run level for nominal short -term rates, and the 
Committee  today , for the first time , endorsed that as a Committee  view.  So I think that ’s 
significant.   I think that ’s what we should be paying attention to, and I would si mply warn you 
that these dots are going to move up and down over time a little bit this way or that.  The dots move d down a little bit in December relative  to September , and they moved up ever  so slightly.  
I really don ’t think it’ s appropriate to read very much into it.  
More generally, you know, the end of 2016 is a long way out.  M onetary policy will be 
geared to evolving conditions in the economy , and the public does need to understand that as 
those views evolve, the Committee ’s views on policy will likely evolve with them.  A nd that ’s a 
kind of uncertainty that the Committee  wouldn’ t want to eliminate completely from its guidance 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 23  
 because we want the policy we put in place to be appropriate to the economic conditions that will 
prevail years down the road. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  I wish to look not to the dots , 
but to the statement, as you suggest, Madam Chair , and that one particular paragraph, which says 
that the Committee  anticipates a lower -than-normal  rate even once you return to the long run.  
So, just so I understand correctly, it mea ns that once you hit the longer -run unemployment rate of 
5—which is the central tendency  average of being 5.4 per cent—once you get a 2 percent 
inflation rate, the market should not , then , anticipate the longer -run 4 percent fed funds rate, a nd 
that woul d be question one.  Question two is , doesn’ t that implicitly suggest a shallower glide 
path once you take off , or once fed funds rate s would begin —when you first hike them?   
Wouldn’ t that suggest a shallower glide path to the funds rate?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the 
Committee  is expressing here, I would say , is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years 
from now ba sed on its —the understanding that we ’ve developed about what are the economic 
forces that have been driving economic activity.   
We’ve had a series of years now in which growth has  proven disappointing.  N ow, 
members of the Committee  have different views about why this is likely to be true , that the funds 
rate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective —they maybe 
have slightly different views on exactly why it ’s likely to be the case that interest rates  will be a 
little lower than they would in the longer run.  But for many, it’ s a matter of headwinds from the 
crisis that have taken a very long time to dissipate and are likely to continue being operative.  So, 
some examples I would say is, we have under —many households are undergoing balance sheet 
repair.  There are many underwater mortgage holders , difficulties therefore in gaining access to 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 23  
 credit —for example, through home equity lines of credit .  For some , that makes it difficult to 
finance small busin esses.  Mortgage credit is very difficult for those still to get without pristine 
credit scores .  That’s improve d somewhat over time , but it ’s not back to normal .  For some , 
fiscal policy is somewhat tighter than would be expected over the  next several years.  For some , 
it’s headwinds from the global economy play a role as well.   
But the general assessment is that even after we’ve had an accommodative monetary 
policy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives, 
the stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve 
somewhat lower than would be normal short -term interest rates.  Now, eventually , years later, 
most people think they will go back up.  But, as you sa id, that suggests the path will be gradual.  
But I do want to emphasize , this is a forecast , and this is the Committee ’s forecast based on its 
understanding of the economy at this time .  And as we watch the economy over the next several 
years , that could e volve.  
YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post .  You mentioned in your testimony on 
Capitol Hill recently that the Fed was trying to assess the balance of weather effects versus more fundamental  weakness in the economy as the reason for the slowdown in growth in the first 
quarter , and you guys mentioned in the statement weather specifically.  Does that mean that the 
Fed’s analysis has come down on the side  of weather, or are you still concerned t hat there could 
be something else going  on that could be contributing  to slower growth ?  And you guys also 
lowered your forecast for GDP growth this year . 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So , I’d say , certainly  the analysis that we’ ve done —and we did spend 
a lot of time discussing weather  and how it ’s affected businesses and households in various parts 
of the country —certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 23  
 in Q1.  It’s not the only factor that is at work, and most proje ctions for growth in the first quarter 
are reasonably weak .  It’s an important factor.  It’s not the only factor.  But I would say it ’s 
likely in the view of most of the Committee  to begin to wash out in the second quarter , and we 
can even see some rebound .  
Now, I would say , I know what we ’ve said about weather is a little bit complicated and 
confusing.  So, you know, let me just say between December and January , the Committee  saw 
data that le d it to be quite a bit more optimistic  about the economic outlook.  So  I would say 
incoming data since January , when our statement sounded quite an optimistic tone , partly down 
due to weather and partly down because we probably over did the optimism in January.  So , in 
some sense , our views have moved around here a little bit, but if we take December to March , 
the Committee ’s views are largely unchanged.  
JIM PUZZA NGHERA.  Hi, Madam Chairwoman.   I’m Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. 
Times.  You ’ve been  on—you’ve served on the Fed previously.  I’m wondering , now , in the past 
few weeks as C hairwoman, what ’s been different about being on the Fe d in your responsibilities 
as Chair, compared to being just a B oard of Governors member?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks.  I feel I ’m very lucky that I ’ve had a lot  of Fed 
experience to draw on  as I approach this role because it ’s complicated , and  now in many ways I 
feel the buck stops with me in terms of management of the FOMC and responsibility to assure 
that the Federal Reserve makes progress on its goals of getting the economy back on track and  
making progress on our financial stability and regulation objectives .  So I feel that weight of 
responsibility keenly in the new role I have, and I ’m very committed to making sure that I 
provide the leadership that ’s necess ary for the Federal Reserve S ystem  to move forward on these 
goals.  But, you know, in terms of the conduct of business, it ’s pretty much the same as usual.

 I’m not envisioning , nor have there been so far , any radical changes in how the Federal Reserve 
does its business, and that includes operating the FOMC. 
ROBIN HARDING.  Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Madam Chair, given  that 
the new qualitative guidance doesn’ t give any information about how you will trade  off your 
unemployment and inflation objectives, does it a ctually give us any information?   How will you 
trade off the risk of higher inflation versus faster  progress on unemployment as you get closer to 
full employment?   Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I’d say so far we haven ’t had that tradeoff to make because 
inflation is r unning well below our objective, a nd by any measure there remains substantial slack 
in the labor market.  So  tradeoffs and worrying about doing more or less because we have 
conflicting objectives, this really has not been an element in our discussions about how to be 
conducting policy now.  As we get closer to meeting our goals , it could become an element, a nd 
I would say that we ’ve given guidance in the statement —and we gave perhaps more guidance in 
our so- called consensus  statement or statement of longer -run goals and mon etary policy 
strategies that we ’ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row —that the Committee  would take a 
balanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we ’re faced with tradeoffs 
between inflation and unemployment.   
When we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where 
such a tradeoff could arise, where we might fa ce a situation where unemployment was quite 
high—namely , over 6½ percent —and inflation might be drifting close to 2  or even a little bit 
above 2.  And our threshold- based guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would 
tolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero.  And to the extent that that concrete guidance is usef ul, 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 23  
 the—I don ’t believe that ’s a situation that we ’re likely —if I thought that that was a situation we 
were likely to encounter in the next several years, we probably would have revised our forward 
guidance in a different way.  We revised it as we did , eliminating that language , because it 
doesn’ t seem like a situation that’ s at all likely.  But I would point you to the statement —the 
final statement in th is statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating 
any change in our policy i ntentions , and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between 
our inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation.  
ANN SAPHIR.  Ann Saphir  with Reuters.  First, I just wanted a quick clarification.  You 
said that something would happen by next fall , and we—on a clear  path —on a path until next 
fall.  I was  unclear if you were speaking of rate hikes or if you were speaking — 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I simply meant to say that if we continued to reduce the pace  of our 
asset purchases in the manner that we have, in measured steps , that the program would be 
winding down next fall. 
ANN SAPHIR.  In this coming fall, you mean , not the fall of next year, is that—just — 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, this coming fall.  
ANN SAPHIR.  To be clear —I just wanted to be clear about that.  Then once you do 
wind down the bond buying program, could you tell us how long of a gap we might expect before the rate hikes do begin?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, the language that we use in the statement is “ considerable ” 
period.  So, I —you know, this is the kind of term —it’ s hard to define.  But, you know, it 
probably means something on the order of  around six months or that type of thing.  But, you 
know, it depends .  What the statement is saying is , it depends what conditions are like.  We need 
to see where the labor market is, how close are we to our full employment goal —that will be a 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 23  
 complicated assessment not just base d on a single statistic —and how rapidly are we moving 
toward it ?  Are  we really close and moving fast?   Or are we gettin g closer but moving very 
slowly?   And then, what the statement emphasizes , and this is the same language we used in 
December and January,  we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 
2 percent objective.  Inflation matters here , too, and our general principle tries to capture that 
notion.  If we have a substantial shortfall in inflation, if inflation is persistently running below 
our 2 percent objective , that is a very good reason to hold the funds rate at its present range for 
longer.  
BINYA MIN  APPELBAUM.  The Committee ’s Vice Chairman , Bill Dudley , said 
recently, “ If the economy decided it was going to grow at 5 percent or the economy decided it 
wasn ’t going to grow at all, those would be the kind of changes in  the outlook that I think would 
warrant changing the pace of taper [ing].”  Is that an accurate description of what you mean when 
you say that you ’re not on a preset course, anything between zero to five?  And, secondly , if I 
may, there ’s a lot of research showing that short -term unemployment seems to be responsible for 
the level of inflation and that long -term unemployment seems relatively uncorrelated.  Is that the 
Fed’s view at this point?  Is that one reason that you expect inflation to rebound in the next 
couple of years?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think the numbers you cited would be extremes in terms of 
defining what we ’d need to see.  I wouldn’ t go to such extremes.  I guess the way I would put it 
is this :  There are two conditions for the Committee  to decide to continue tapering the pace of 
purchases.  The first is that we need to assess that the labor market continues to be on the mend 
and that we feel reasonably satisfied that the outlook is for further improvement in  the labor 
market that will get us back to our maximum employment objective.  And , second of all, we 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 23  
 need to see— and now coming back to inflation again—inflation is low , and it ’s been running 
well below our objective.  And we need to see evidence that leaves us feeling satisfied that 
inflation will move up over time, that we believe the evidence is consistent with its moving up over time .   
If the Committee  no longer feels comfortable making such assessments —so, if there is 
enough change in the data we ’re seeing about the economy that it no longer seems reasonable or 
convincing to make those  two separate assessments, then a case has been made to change the 
pace of asset purchases and to deviate from the current plan.  So 5 percent  and 1 percent, those 
are very extreme numbers.  But I would want to feel confident in making those two statements about the labor market and inflation.   
With respect to the issue of short -term unemployment and its being more relevant for 
inflation and a  better measure of the labor market, I ’ve seen res earch along those lines.  I think it 
would be tremendously premature to adopt any notion that says that that is an accurate read on 
either how inflation is determined or what constitutes slack in the labor market.  So I think this is something our Committe e will be looking at, especially as unemployment goes down and other 
labor market indicators hopefully simultaneously improve.  We ’ll be looking at a broad range of 
indicators.  We ’re looking to see progress on many different dimensions where we see slack in 
the economy, but I wouldn’ t endorse, and I certainly don’ t think our Committee  would endorse, 
the judgment of the research that you cited.  
JEFF KE ARNS.  Jeff Ke arns from Bloomberg News.  You’ve spoken in the past about —
thinking about back to March of la st year —of how you supplement your view of the labor 
market beyond unemployment with other gauges like qui t rates and lay offs and things like that.  
How has  your dashboard evolved in the past few months in terms both of the —which indicators 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 23  
 you like to watch most, and also in terms of the quality of data that you think—whether it ’s 
positive, negative —that you ’re getting from these indicators.  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I have talked in the past about indicators I like to watch or I think 
that are relevant in assessing the labor market.  In addition to the standard unemployment rate, I 
certainly look at broader  measures of unemployment.  I mentioned U -6 in my statement.  It—
5 percent of the labor force working part time on an involuntary basis, that ’s an exceptionally 
high number relative to the measured unemployment rate, and it—so, to my mind, is a form of 
slack that is —adds to what we see in the normal unemployment rate and is unusually large.  
However, it is coming down, as well as U -3.  It’s movi ng in the right direction and has  moved 
even more recently than U -3.  Of course, I watch discouraged and marginally attached workers.  
The share of long -term unemployment has been immensely high and can be very stubborn in 
bringing down, that’s something t hat I watch closely .  Again, that remains exceptionally high, 
but it has come down from something like 45 percent  to high 30s, but that ’s certainly on my 
dashboard.  Labor force participation— I do think most research suggests that due to 
demographic factor s, labor force participation will be coming down, and there has been a 
downward trend now for a number of years.  But I think there is also a cyclical component in the 
fact that labor force participation is depressed.  And so, it may be that as the economy  begins to 
strengthen, we could see labor force participation flatten out for a time as discouraged workers start moving back into the labor market.  And so that ’s something I ’m watching closely.   
In the Committee , we’ll have to watch —there are different views on this within the 
Committee , and it ’s hard to know definitively what part of labor force participation is structural 
versus cyclical , so it’s something to watch closely.  I’ve also mentioned, in the past , measures of 
labor market  turnover.  You mentioned quits.  A remarkably large share of workers quit their 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 23  
 jobs every month, usually going directly into another job.  And I take the quit rate in many ways 
as a sign of the health of the economy.  When workers are scared they won’ t be able to get other 
jobs, they show a reduced willingness to quit their jobs.  Now, quit rates now are below normal 
pre-recession levels, but on the other hand, they have come up over time , and so we have seen 
improvement.  The job opening rate has also come up.  The hires rate, however, remains extremely depressed , and I take that as a sign of a weaker labor market.  But most of these 
measures, although they don’ t paint the identical extent of improvement, if you ask about my 
dashboard, the dial on virtual ly all of those things is moving in a direction of improvement.   
The final thing I ’d mention is wages , and wage growth has really been very low.  I know 
there is perhaps one isolated measure of wage growth that suggests some uptick, but most measures of w age increase are running at very low levels.  In fact, with the productivity growth 
we have and 2 percent inflation, one would probably expect to see , on an ongoing basis , 
something between—perhaps 3 and 4 percent wage inflation would be normal.  Wage inflation 
has been running at 2 percent.  So not only is it depressed, signaling weakness in the labor market, but it is certainly not flashing .  An increase in  it might signal some tightening or 
meaningful pressures on inflation, at least over time.  And I would say we ’re not seeing that.  
WYATT ANDREWS.  Madam Chair, Wyatt Andrews from CBS.  For tens of millions of 
Americans, the recovery is an awful long time coming.  May we know your thoughts on why the recovery is so slow , and why the economy is not creating more jobs?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think the short answer is that we have lived through a 
devastating financial crisis that has taken an exceptional toll on the economy in many different ways, from housing to leaving a huge number of homeowners  with mortgages living in homes 
with mortgages that are underwater , has had a highly negative effect on their credit ratings  and 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 23  
 their ability to access credit, has left businesses with very cautious attitudes that we see in 
busines s investment spending that is very restrained.  On top of that, we ’ve had weakness in the 
global economy , and we ’ve had a very tight fiscal policy at home .  After stimulus a t the onset of 
the recession, we ’ve had a good deal of fiscal consolidation in the United States and, at a time 
when fiscal policy normally in the past would have been serving to create jobs, fiscal policy from that standpoint has served as a headwind to the recovery.  And at the federal —especially at the 
federal level , but also with sta te and local levels as well.  And so we have had a disappointing 
recovery.  And monetary policy has tried to do what we can to offset that.  But, you know, the 
linkages aren ’t as strong and aren ’t as quick as we might ideally like them to be.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  I’d like to take you back to last summer when there were 
hints —the Fed made hints that they were going to taper, and long -term interest rates spiked, 
mortgage rates rose.  What lessons —looking back at that crisis, at that period, what lessons have 
you learned from it , and are you confident that you won’ t repeat that —those mistakes again?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think there were quite a number of things happening at that 
time.  I think it ’s probably true that monetary policy may have played a role  in touching off that 
market reaction, but I think the market reaction was exacerbated by the fact that we had a very significant unwinding of carry trades  and other leveraged positions that investors had taken, 
perhaps thinking that the level of volatilit y was exceptionally low and perhaps lower than was 
safe for them to have assumed.  But we certainly saw —now, in some ways, the fact that term 
premia in interest rates have come up somewhat, although it has had a negative effect on the recovery and that ’s evident in housing —in the slowdown in housing —perhaps it ’s diminished 
some financial instability risk that may have been associated with these carry trades and speculative activities that were unwinding during that time.  A lesson is that we will try, and w e 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 23  
 were trying then, but we will continue to try to communicate as clearly as we possibly can about 
how we will conduct monetary policy and to be as steady and determined and as transparent as we can to provide as much clarity as is reasonably certain —given  that the economic 
developments in the economy are themselves uncertain —but we will try as hard as we can not to 
be a source of instability here.  
REBECCA JARVIS.  Madam Chair, Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  One of  the drivers last 
spring and summer of home prices and home sales  was that sense  that interest rates were going 
up, that they were spiking .  And now, a year later, we ’re looking essentially at a flat interest rate 
picture as far as homebuyers are concerned .  So, is there any sense on your Committee  that 
staying at this level loses its punch the longer we remain here?  And if I ’m a buyer, and I ’m 
thinking about going out and buying a home, why should I do that today as opposed to waiting a few more years or even months before interest rates then do go up?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think the level of interest rates remains low by historic levels.  
And the level of household formation is very depressed, has been very depressed for some time.  There are a lot of ki ds who were shacking up with their families and probably would like to be 
going out and acquiring places of their own, whether it ’s an apartment or a home.  There ’s a lot 
of demographic potential there for new household formation that would ultimately gene rate new 
construction, either sing le or multifamily, and the level of rates I think does matter.  And the fact 
that they ’re low now , I think, is something that should serve as a stimulus to people coming back 
into the housing market.  And what we ’ve not ye t seen—the  pickup after the lull—after interest 
rates went up last summer, I do expect housing activity to begin to expand more rapidly later on.  I don ’t think it’ s only the expectation that “ I have to move now or things will be more expensive 
later” that  spurs those decisions .  So—

 KATE DAVIDSON.  Hi, Kate Davidson from Politico.  Much has been made about the 
fact that you and your predecessor agreed on many policies.  You shared a lot of the same policy 
views.  Can you tell us one way in which your chair manship will be different than Ben 
Bernanke’ s? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think we are committed to exactly the same set of goals.  And, 
you know, as I indicated,  I—my goal, and I will, you know, throw myself into this as 
wholeheartedly as I can, is to make rapid progress, as rapid progress as we possibly can in getting this recovery back on track and putting Americans back to work and into jobs, and in moving inflation back up to levels at the Committee ’s target of 2 percent.  My predecessor was 
also devoted t o that.  Strengthening the financial system is a work in progress , and he made large 
inroads in strengthening the financial system.  I’d just say , there is more work to be done, I have 
a long to- do list.  I would absolutely —it’ s high priority for me to see  further work done in 
addressing too- big-to-fail.  We have a to -do list of things we want to accomplish, and in  
assessing threats to financial stability because neither one of us —and no one wants to live 
through a financial crisis like the last one , and we  want to be extremely cognizant of emerging 
threats to the financial system.  So I haven ’t answered your question by saying that I will be 
different, but I think he had a very good agenda , and it ’s one I shared.  It’s why I came to 
Washington to be V ice C hair, and it ’s the agenda I expect to continue pursuing.  
PETER BARNES.  Madam Chair, Peter Barnes of Fox Business.  I wanted to talk about 
international developments and the crisis in the Ukraine.  Is the crisis a headwind for the U.S. 
economy?  Are there r isks to the U.S. economy and the U.S. banking system , directly and 
indirectly?  And did the Russians move $100 billion in U.S. Treasury securities out of the United 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 23  
 States in the last couple of weeks to avoid U.S. sanctions?  Those are—those foreign securi ties 
are held by the Fed.  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with the last piece of your question first.  I’m sorry , 
I—movements in custodial accounts at the New York Fed are something that I can ’t—I’m not in 
the position to be able to comment about.  But in terms of the situation in Ukraine and Russia, 
it’s something that we ’re monitoring very closely.  We discussed in our meeting the direct -trade 
linkages or exposures of the U.S. banking system to the Ukraine and Russia are not large.  That’s —we ’re not seeing meaningful impacts now, but obviously there are geopolitical risks 
here that it ’s very important for us to be attentive to and to keep our eye on.  And we ’re not 
seeing broader global financial r epercussions, but if this were to escalate, that would certainly be 
something that would be on our radar screen, but we ’re not seeing —we ’re not seeing that now 
and we ’re monitoring it closely.  
VICTORIA MCGRANE.  Victoria McGrane from Dow Jones Newswires.  You ’ve 
spoken about how unemployment is more than just statistics to you.  And I wanted to ask, when you ma ke that statement, who do you have in mind or —and what do you do, if anything , to keep 
in touch with that kind of human side of the impact of the economic crisis and slow recovery that we’ve had?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I ’d be surprised if anyone in this room doesn’ t know someone 
who has been touched by the crisis, by unemployment, by difficulties in getting jobs, and that  is 
true of me and my family and friends, I think, as it is probably for many of you.  I talk to a broad 
range of business contacts and try to stay in touch with what ’s happening with real people in the 
economy.  We have —do a lot of work in community development in the Fed and have groups 
come to talk to us and explain to us how their communities have been affected by the economic 
March 19, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 23  
 situation and by the housing crisis.  When I was in San Francisco, we worked —you know, we 
had programs there, we worked very closely , particularly in low -income communities that have 
been very badly affected, to design programs that could potentially be helpful.  We tried to study 
what kinds of programs can be most effective and to try to under stand what kinds of advice we 
could give to those in the community development lending field to help.  So I do try to listen to people that represent communities that are experiencing the worst of the crisis and stay in touch with it that way.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  
June 1 8, 2014 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its 
June meeting earlier today.  As was indicated in our policy statement, the Committee decided to 
make another modest reduction in the pace of its purchases of longer -term securities.  The 
Committee maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view  that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  
Today’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is 
continuing to make progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  In the l abor market, conditions have improved further.  The unemployment rate, at 6.3 percent, is 
four-tenths lower than at the time of our March meeting, and the broader U -6 measure— which 
includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but prefer ring full -time 
work —has fallen by a similar amount.  Even given these declines, however, unemployment 
remains elevated, and a broader assessment of indicators suggests that underutilization in the labor market remains significant.  
Although real GDP decline d in the first quarter, this decline appears to have resulted 
mainly from transitory factors.  Private domestic final demand —that is, spending by domestic 
households and businesses —continued to expand in the first quarter, and the limited set of 
indicators  of spending and production in the second quarter have picked up.  The Committee thus 
believes that economic activity is rebounding in the current quarter and will continue to expand at a moderate pace thereafter.  Overall, the Committee continues to see s ufficient underlying 
strength  in the economy to support ongoing improvement in the labor market.  
Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and the 
Committee remains mindful that inflation running persistently below its obje ctive could pose 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 21  
 risks to economic performance.  Given that longer -term inflation expectations appear to be well 
anchored, and in light of the ongoing recovery in the United States and in many economies 
around the world, the Committee continues to expect i nflation to move gradually back toward its 
objective.  The Committee will continue to assess incoming data carefully to ensure that policy is consistent with attaining the FOMC’s longer -run objectives of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent. 
This outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections submitted in conjunction 
with this meeting by the FOMC participants.  As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own views of appropriate monetary policy.  The central  tendency of the 
unemployment rate projections is slightly lower than in the March projections and now stands at 6.0 to 6.1 percent at the end of this year.  From there, Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer -run normal level by the end of 2016.  The central 
tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is 2.1 to 2.3 percent for 2014, down notably from the March projections, largely because of the unexpected contraction in the first quarter.  Over the next two y ears, the projections for real GDP growth remain somewhat above the 
estimates of longer -run normal growth.  Finally, FOMC participants continue to see inflation 
moving only gradually back toward 2 percent over time as the economy expands.  The central 
tendency of the inflation projections is 1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.6 to 2 percent  in 
2016. 
As I noted at the outset, the Committee decided today to make another measured 
reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  Starting next month, we will be p urchasing $35 billion 
of securities per month, down $10 billion per month from our current rate.  Even after today’s action takes effect, we will continue to expand our holdings of longer -term securities, and we 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 21  
 will also continue to roll over maturing Tre asury securities and reinvest principal payments from 
the FOMC’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage -backed securities in agency 
mortgage -backed securities.  These sizable and still -increasing holdings will continue to put 
downward pressure on long er-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial 
conditions more accommodative, helping to support job creation and a return of inflation to the 
Committee’s objective.  
Today’s announced reduction in the pace of asset purchases reflects the Committee’s 
expectation that progress toward its economic objectives will continue.  If incoming information 
broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer -run objective, the Committee will likely 
continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in  measured steps at future meetings.  However, as 
I have emphasized before, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions 
about the pace of purchases  remain contingent on its outlook for  jobs and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.  
Let me now turn to the framework we will be applying as we consider interest rate 
policy.  In determining how long to mai ntain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress —both realized and expected —toward its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This broad assessment will not hinge on any one or  two indicators, but will take into account a wide range of information, 
including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  Based on its current assessment of these factors, the Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 21  
 especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run 
goal, and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Further, once we begin to 
remove policy accommodation, it ’s the Committee’s current assessment that, even after 
employment and inflation are nea r mandate- consistent levels, economic conditions may, for 
some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as 
normal in the longer run.  
This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported i n the 
participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer -run normal values at the end of 2016.  Although FOMC participants provide a 
number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remain ing below its longer -run normal 
level, many cite the residual effects of the financial crisis.  These include restrained household spending, reduced credit availability, and diminished expectations for future growth in output 
and incomes, consistent with t he view that the potential growth rate of the economy may be 
lower for so me time.  
Let me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectation for the path of the federal 
funds rate target is contingent on the economic outlook.  If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged.  Conversely, if economic performance disappoints, resulting in larger and more persistent deviations from the Committee’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to take place later and to be more gradual.

Page 5 of 21  
 Before taking you r questions, I’d like to provide an update on the Committee’s ongoing 
discussions on the mechanics of normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy.  To be 
clear, these discussions are in no way intended to signal any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy.  Rather, they represent prudent planning on the part of the Committee and reflect the Committee’s intention to communicate its plans to the public well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate.  
The Committee is co nfident that it has the tools it needs to raise short- term interest rates 
when it becomes appropriate to do so and to control the level of short -term interest rates 
thereafter, even though the Federal Reserve will continue to have a very large balance sheet for some time.  The Committee’s recent discussions have centered on the appropriate mix of tools to employ during the normalization process and the associated implications for the degree of control over short -term interest rates, the functioning of the f ederal funds market, and the extent 
to which the Federal Reserve transacts with financial institutions outside the banking sector.  The Committee is constructively working through the many issues related to normalization and will continue its discussions i n upcoming meetings, with the expectation of providing additional 
details later this year.  
Thank you.  I’ll be happy to take your questions. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  There is every reason to expect, Madam 
Chair, that the PCE inflation rate, which is followed by the Fed, looks likely to exceed your 2016 consensus forecast next week .  Does this suggest that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on 
inflation?  And what tolerance is there for higher inflation at the Federal Reserve?  And if it’ s 
above the 2 percent target, then how is that not kind of blowing through a target the same way 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 21  
 you blew through the 6½ percent unemployment target in that they become these soft targets?  
Thanks.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks for the question.  So I think recent readings on, for 
example, the CPI index have been a bit on the high side, but I think it’ s—the data that we ’re 
seeing is noisy.  I think it’ s important to remember that, broadly speaking, inflation is evolving in 
line with the C ommittee ’s expectati ons.  The C ommittee, it h as expected a gradual return in 
inflation toward its 2 percent objective.  And I think the recent evidence we have seen, abstracting from the noise, suggests that we are moving back gradually over time toward our 2 percent objectiv e, and I see things roughly in line with where we expected inflation to be.  I think 
if you look at the SEP projections that were submitted this time, you see very little change in inflation projections of the C ommittee .  
STEVE LIESMAN.  What about the tolerance for higher inflation?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, the C ommittee has emphasized that we have  the 2  percent 
objective  for, as a longer -term matter , for PCE inflation and we would not willingly see a 
prolonged period in which inflation persistently runs below our objective or above our objective , 
and that remains true.  So that hasn ’t changed at all in terms of the C ommittee ’s tolerance for 
permanent deviations from our objective.  And we continue to see the data coming in, abstracting from the noise , in line with what we had expected, and continue to see a gradual pickup over the 
next several years toward our 2 percent objective.  
ROBIN HARDING.  Robi n Harding from the Financial Times .  Madam Chair, could you 
comment a little bit more on the decline in the long -run interest rate projection?  Is that more to 
do with temporary headwinds from the recovery or is it something more permanent about the 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 21  
 econom y?  And is this it, this decline to 3.75 percent ?  Or do you think there ’s potential for this 
rate to go lower yet?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you do see a very slight decline this time in the C ommittee ’s 
longer -term normal rate of interest projections.  You know, I would caution you, however, we’ve 
had turnover in the C ommittee —two new participants who joined and are submitting projections 
and two who departed —and that can create changes in the projections , small changes that are 
difficult to interpret.   But I think it’ s fair to say there has been a slight decline.  And I think, you 
know, the most likely reason for that is there has been some slight decline, as I mentioned in my 
opening statement, of projec tions pertaining to longer -term growth, and typically estimates of the 
longer -run normal federal funds rate or short -term interest rates would move in  line with growth 
projections. 
YLAN MUI.  Hi , Ylan from the Washington Post .  My question is sort of the f lip side of 
Steve’ s, and it’ s about your outlook for unemployment.  Your predecessor has said that the Fed 
has been consistently too pessimistic about the level of the unemployment rate, and today, you guys lowered your outlook again.  Can you tell me a little bit more about how you see the unemployment rate evolving to meet your forecast?   Why you believe the rate of decline will 
start to level off?   And what an unexpected drop might mean for the first  rate hike.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, it’ s true that unemploym ent has declined by more than the 
Committee expected and you do see a small downward revision in the C ommittee ’s projections, 
at least the central tendency for the unemployment rate.  Now, first of all, I mean, the labor market , I think, has continued to broadly improve.   We have seen continued job growth at a pace 
that is certainly sufficient to be diminishing labor market slack over time.   Over the last three 
months , for example, employment—payroll employment —has been rising around 230,000 jobs 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 21  
 per month and we ’re running close to 200,000 over the last year.  So, it’ s in no way surprising to 
see a  decline in the unemployment rate.  That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a 
portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perha ps not representing a diminution of slack 
in the labor market.  We have seen labor force participation rate decline.   And while I think most 
of us would agree that there has been and will continue to be secular decline in the labor force 
participation rate  for demographic reasons, I think a portion of the decline we’ve seen in the 
unemployment rate probably reflects a kind of shadow unemployment or discouragement, a cyclical part of labor force participation.   Now, if that ’s correct, we may see that as the economy 
picks up steam and we see further recovery in the labor market, that those, let ’s call them 
discouraged workers, will return either to unemployment or to employment.   And as labor force 
participation begins to stabilize, the unemployment rate will come down less quickly.  And I think for a number of people, that ’s a component of the forecast.  
You asked about implications for the path of policy and I would just say, the guidance 
that we ’ve given, our forward guidance , states that the timing of liftof f will depend on actual 
progress we see and the progress we expect to see going forward in terms of achieving both of our goals, namely maximum employment and our 2 percent inflation objective.  So, we ’re not 
going to look at any single indicator like the unemployment rate to assess how we ’re doing on 
meeting our employment goal ; we will look at a broad range of indicators.  That said, as I tried  to 
emphasize in my opening statement, there is uncertainty about monetary policy.  The appropriate path of policy, the timing in pace of interest rate increases, ought to and I believe will respond to unfolding economic developments.  If those were to prove faster than the C ommittee expects, it 
would be logical to expect a more rapid increase in the fed funds r ate.  But the opposite also 
holds true.  If we don ’t see the improvement that ’s projected in the baseline outlook, that the 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 21  
 opposite would be true and the pace of the timing and pace of interest rate increases would be 
later and more gradual.  
JON HILSENRAT H.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, some 
Fed officials and some market commentators have noted that market conditions recently have 
looked a little bit like they did last spring before a period of turbulence.  Volatility is very  low in 
stock and bond markets.  Risk premiums are very low, and in particular, the market expectations 
for interest rates, for short -term interest rates look below even the Fed’s own projections as laid 
out in your dot plot.  I wanted to ask two questions  related to that.  One, what is your read on 
these—on market activity , and are you at all concerned about a sense of complacency in 
markets?  And , two, what is your view on market expectations for the rate hike cycle that the Fed 
has laid out in its dot pl ot?  Or, is the market where you think the Fed is on that?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, I’d start by saying that volatility , both actual and 
expected , in markets is at low levels.  The FOMC has no target for what the right level of 
volatility should be.  But to the extent that low levels of volatility may induce risk -taking 
behavior that , for example, entails excessive buildup in leverage or maturity extension, things 
that can pose risks to financial stability later on, that is a concern to me and to the C ommittee .  I 
don’t know whether a number of reasons have been cited for what we ’re seeing in the 
marketplace.   I don’ t know if overconfidence or complacency is one of those reasons.  But I 
guess I would say, it is important , as I emphasized in my opening statement , for market 
participants to recognize that there is uncertainty about what the path of interest rate s—short -
term rates —will be.   And that ’s necessary because there’ s uncertainty about what the path of the 
economy wi ll be.  And I want to emphasize , as I have, that the FOMC will adjust policy to what 
it actually sees unfolding in the economy over time , and that necessarily gives rise to a certain 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 21  
 level of uncertainty about what the path of rates will be.  And it is imp ortant for market 
participants to factor that into their decisionmaking.  You asked me about the dot plot —our 
forecast , or our projections , for the f ed funds rate —and you do see a range of disagreement 
among the participants there , so by the time you get t o 2016, there is a considerable range of 
opinion, and I think, in part, that reflects the uncertainty that I’m talking about —that participants 
do see different pace of recovery, different trajectories for inflation, and it’ s appropriate for them 
to adjust their thinking about what the path of policy should be to their own view of how the 
economy will evolve over time.  And around each of those dots, I think every participant who ’s 
filling out that questionnaire has a considerable band of uncertainty around their own individual forecast.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  You ’ve spoken about 
the sense that the recession has done permanent damage to the economic output and you’ve 
reduced gradually over time your forecast of long -term growth .  I am curious to know to what 
extent you think stronger monetary and/or fiscal policy could reverse those trends.  Are we stuck with slower growth?  Is there something that you can do about it?  If so, what?  If not, why?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well , I think pa rt of the reason that we are seeing slower growth  in 
potential output may reflect the fact that capital investment has been very weak during the downturn in the long recovery that we ’re experiencing.   So, a diminished contribution from 
capital formation to  growth does make a negative contribution to growth.  And as the economy 
picks up, I certainly would hope to see that contribution restored.  So, I think that ’s one of the 
factors that ’s been operative.  Of course, we ’ve had unusually long duration unemplo yment.  A 
very large fraction of those unemployed have been unemployed for more than six months.  And there is the fear that those individuals find it harder to gain employment , that their attachment to 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 21  
 the labor force may diminish over time and the networ ks of contacts that are —they have that are 
helpful in gaining employment can begin to erode over time.  We could see what ’s known as 
hysteresis , where individuals , because they haven ’t had jobs for a long time, find themselves 
permanently outside the labor force.  My hope would be that as —and my expectation is that as 
the economy recovers, we will see some repair of that , that many of those individuals who were 
long-term unemployed or those who are now counted as out of the labor force would take jobs if 
the economy is stronger and would be drawn back in again, but it is conceivable that there is 
some permanent damage there to them, to their own well -being, their family ’s well -being, and 
the economy ’s potential.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I believe you mentioned in your opening 
remarks tighter credit, and I’m wondering what you think of the possibility that the Federal 
Reserve itself , with the regulations it has to impose unde r Dodd -Frank , is partly responsible for 
that.  And , second, the current trend toward litigation.  I recently read something where just the 
three largest banks in the U.S. have paid $51 billion dollars in fine s so far, and obviously, the 
number is rising.  So, why would anybody loan to a near -prime borrower ?  And, in fact, if you 
look at Federal Reserve Bank of New York research, here we are, five years into the expansion, 
and people below FICO of 700 are having worse credit experiences.  So it probably isn ’t 
because, you know, unemployment’s declining.  It’s probably because banks simply don ’t want 
to take the risk.  So, as the nation’ s top bank regulator, what can you do to fix that?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I first would start by saying that I really think it’ s essential in the 
aftermath of this crisis to strengthen financial regulation and to make the financial system more robust and to reduce systemic risk.  We can see what the costs of the financial crisis were and I don’t think any of us should want to see that repeated.   So, I think the regulations that we ’ve put 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 21  
 in place, most of which follow from Dodd- Frank, are highly appropriate to create a more robust 
financial system that will be a safer and sounder one for our economy going forward, and I think 
we’re making progress on doing that.  In putting regulations into place, we have tried to phase 
them in, in a way that gives long enough lead times to make sure that in strengthening the financial system, we don ’t produce a credit crunch.  A nd by and large, my own assessment is that 
credit is broadly available in the economy, but there are some exceptions , and I would agree with 
much of what you said when it comes to mortgage credit.  I think banks , at this point , are 
reluctant to lend to borrowers with lower FI CO scores.  They mention in meetings with us 
consistently their concerns about putback risk , and I think they are —it is difficult for any 
homeowner who doesn ’t have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage.  I think that is one of 
the factors that is c ausing the housing recovery to be slow.  It’s not the only one , but I would 
agree with that assessment.  And of course, you know, there were a lot of practices in connection 
with mortgage lending that really need ed to be changed, we don’t want to go back t o those days, 
but it is important to clarify —for us  to work to clarify the rules around mortgage lending to 
create an environment of greater certainty for lenders to be willing to extend mortgage credit.  
JASON LANGE.  Good afternoon, Jason Lange with Reute rs.  Chair Yellen, the Fed has 
slashed its growth projections for this year , and you’ve gone to pains to explain that there is 
uncertainty in the path of interest rates in the economy , and yet the Fed central tendency 
projections for 2015 and 2016 remain quite strong.  Are you confident that the U.S. economy has entered a period of sustained above -trend economic growth?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, when you say “ confident,”  I suppos e the answer is “ no” 
because there is uncertainty, but I think there are many good reasons why we should see a period of sustained growth in excess of the economy ’s potential.  We have a highly accommodative 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 21  
 monetary policy.  We have diminishing fiscal dra g.  We have easing credit conditions.  We have 
households who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service 
that debt, an improving job market.  We have rising home prices and rising equity prices and an improving global economy , at least in my estimation.   So I think all of those things ought to be 
working to produce above -trend growth and I think that ’s what ’s reflected in the forecast.  But , 
nevertheless , as I said, of course there is uncertainty around that projection.  Y ou know, 
nevertheless, the labor market has continued to improve, and over a number of years in which, admittedly , growth has come in at a disappointing level, we ’ve still seen the labor market 
broadly improve , and I expect that to continue.  
STEVEN BECKNE R.  Steve Beckner with MNI, Madam Chair.  You mentioned that 
there were discussions of the mechanics of normalization, as you put it.  I assume that that 
involved some review of the —it was the third anniversary of the June 2011 exit principles.  I 
wonder if I could get you to elaborate .  In particular, is the C ommittee reaching a consensus 
about the reinvestment and rollover policies, the timing of discontinuing those policies ?  And I’d 
be interested in your personal view on that.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, reinvestment policy was included in our 2011 exit principles , 
and it’ s one of the things that we are discussing and reconsidering.  We have not yet reached — 
we’ve made quite a lot of progress in our discussion, but we ’ve not yet reached conclusions 
about that or other aspects of our package.  There are a couple of things Chairman Bernanke 
indicated , in contrast to our 2011 principles , that we would be very unlikely to sell mortgage -
back ed securities , and that remains the case.  Broadly speaking, some of the principles that were 
incorporated in those —in that 2011 package, the notion that we fully expect our balance sheet to 
shrink considerably over time back toward more normal levels, toward levels that would be 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 21  
 consistent with efficiently conducting mo netary policy, that ’s still an expectation.  I believe it’ s 
an expectation that eventually our portfolio will be —consist largely of T reasuries , eventually, 
but the re are quite a number of details.  We have a number —as you know , a number of tools that 
we can deploy as we move to normalize policy :  interest on excess reserves, our overnight RRP 
facility, term repurchase agreements with the markets, our T erm D eposit F acility , and exactly 
how to deploy that set of tools to meet our objective of raising short —the general level of short -
term rates when the time becomes appropriate, and how best to communicate to the public and to 
markets how we are conducting policy and what our objectives are.  Those are things we ’re 
discussing and hope we will be able to come back with a full description, or let ’s think of it as a 
revised set of exit principles , later this year.  
DONNA BORAK.  Madam Chair, Donna Borak with American Banker .  One of the 
outstanding reform issues on the plate of the Fed i s to handle the risk related to short -term 
wholesale funding.  You ’ve been very supportive of this issue, but we ’ve really heard little 
progress so far on where things stand.  Can you please explain to us why it’ s taken so long to get 
this proposal out?  What are some of the aspects that the Fed is considering in their approach to 
how they roll out this rule, and where we may be in that process?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’m afraid that I can’t give you a detailed timetable for when we 
will move forwar d with that rule.   I’ve been supportive , Governor Tarullo and others have been 
supportive , of taking some action to diminish the incentives for heavy reliance on short -term 
funding.  We still see that as one of the risks to the financial system that wasn ’t really addressed 
in the risk -based capital requirements that we put out or in the liquidity coverage ratio that ’s out 
for proposal.  Governor Tarullo has suggested one approach could be to impose a capital requirement that ’s related to reliance on wholes ale funding, and in my own past comments, I’ve 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 21  
 been supportive, but I’m afraid at this point —and this remains very much on the table to take 
some action to address this —it certainly remains  on the table as an unfinished agenda item, but I 
don’t have a detailed timetable for you.  
DONNA BORAK.  Would it be at some point before the end of the year , at least?  Can 
you say that much?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m not —I’m just not certain.  I’m—I just don’ t have a detailed 
timetable for you, I’m sorry.  
GREG IP.  Madam Chair, Greg Ip of t he Economist .  This is partly a follow -up to Steve 
Liesman ’s question.  How would the C ommittee respond if inflation did temporarily move above 
target in the near term before you achieve full employment?  Your colleague John Williams and 
the IMF have both suggested that the C ommittee might consider allowing inflation to 
temporarily overshoot because that might achieve a faster, larger improve ment  in employment.  
Second question is:  Will financial stability  considerations play a role in when and how fast the 
Committee normalizes interest rates?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So with respect to the question of overshooting, let me start by saying 
that inflation continues to run well below our objective, and we ’re still some  ways away from 
maximum employment.  A nd for the moment, I don’ t see any tradeoff whatsoever in achieving 
our two objectives.  They both call for the same policy —namely , a highly accommodative 
monetary policy.  So, at best, overshooting of inflation or the  thought that we will reach our 
inflation objective before we have attained maximum employment, I suppose I would see , at 
most , as a risk that we could face somewhere down the road.  Symmetrically, it’ s also 
conceivably a risk that we would reach our maxim um employment objective before we ’ve 
actually attained our inflation objective.  So there are different ways in which we could 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 21  
 conceivably —or there could conceivably arise policy conflicts or tradeoff s somewhere down the 
road.  
Now, quite some time ago, the FOMC adopted, and we reaffirmed just in January , a 
statement on our longer -run goals and policy strategy .  And what that statement said is that, first 
of all, whenever either inflation or employment are away from their preferred or mandate -
consistent l evels, it will always be the FOMC ’s policy to make sure that we get back to those 
target levels over the medium term.   But a principle that ’s embodied in that statement is that the 
Committee will follow a so -called balanced approach in deciding on its poli cies.  And , 
essentially, that means that when we see some conflict between achieving the two objectives , 
that we would consider in deciding on a policy just how far we are from achieving each of the 
objectives .  And if the distance from achieving an object ive is particularly large, it would be 
consistent with a  balanced approach that we would tolerate some movement in the opposite 
direction on the other objective.  But balanced approach is the general policy strategy I think we’d follow.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I’d like to 
ask you about your signaling mechanism going forward.  At this point you haven ’t decided on 
reinvestments.  You ’ve told people , don’ t pay any attention to the dot plot, and your two 
mandates, inflation and unemployment, are backward- looking lagging indicators.  So, if 
something should surprise in the economy with only four SEPs and press conferences a year, how do you signal to the markets what the Fed is doing so that you don’ t run the risk of  an event 
like last September when people were surprised, or some sort of credibility problem where people feel you’re falling behind the economy?  
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 21  
 CHAIR YELLEN.   Well, you know, again, we are very attentive to unfolding economic 
developments and understand that there can be surprises and twists and turns in the road, so that 
the forecasts that we ’ve made become no longer appropriate and we need to respond to unfol ding 
developments.  I’m personally committed to communicating with the public whenever 
communication is appropriate.  We have four press conferences, but I would feel it appropriate for me to either have additional communications meetings with the press or  to give speeches or 
to, in a variety of opportunities I have , to make clear what the C ommittee ’s thinking is , and my 
colleagues as well , I think, would feel it entirely appropriate to communicate changes —changes 
in our views. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.   Hi, I’m Pedr o da Costa from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thank you 
very much.  Since we are currently having a World Cup, I thought it would be valid to ask a question about the world.   And I’m surprised —a little surprised at the optimism of your forecast 
given some, you kno w, the darkening outlook overseas.  You ’ve got conflict in the Ukraine, 
escalation of war in Iraq with implications for oil prices that potentially have global economic impact.  You have —excuse me—a European recovery that ’s still fairly weak, and emerging 
markets that are slowing down sharply.  Do you think the U.S. can be a lone engine of economic recovery globally?  And if I could just follow up very quickly on Greg ’s question, because you 
talked about the two sides of the mandate, but you didn’ t quite answer the financial stability part.  
Do you think—is financial stability currently preventing the Fed from being more accommodative than it would like?  And if not, when do you expect that to happen, if at all?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, let me —I’m sorry I didn’ t answer the last part of Greg ’s question 
and the last part of yours.  Let me start there.  With respect to financial stability, we monitor 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 21  
 potential threats to financial stability very , very  carefully, and we have spoken about some —I’ve 
spoken in recent congressional testimonies and speeches about some threats to financial stability 
that are on our radar screen , that we are monitoring.  Trends in leverage d lending and the 
underwriting standards there, diminished risk spreads in lower -grade corporate bonds —high -
yield bonds —have certainly caught our attention.  There is some evidence of reach -for-yield 
behavior.  That ’s one of the reasons I mentioned that this environment of low volatility is very 
much on my radar screen and would be a conce rn to me if it prompted an increase in leverage or 
other kinds of risk- taking behavior that could unwind in a sharp way and provoke a sharp, for 
example, jump in interest rates.   And we ’ve seen what effect that can have on the global 
economy, and I think i t’s something that it’ s important to avoid.   
But broadly speaking, if the question is , to what extent is monetary policy , at this time , 
being driven by financial stability concerns , I would say that —well, I would never take off the 
table that monetary policy should—could, in some circumstances , respond.  I don ’t see them 
shaping monetary policy in an important way right now.  I don’ t see a broad -based increase in 
leverage, rapid increase in credit growth or maturity transformation, the kinds of broad tr ends 
that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level.  And we are using supervisory tools and regulations both to make the financial system more robust and to pay particular attention to areas where we ’ve spotted concerns , like leveraged 
lending, which is very much a focus of our supervision.  
Now, let ’s see.   There was a first part to your question, and the first part was about global 
risks, and we always pay attention to global risks and the likely evol ution of the global economy.  
You expressed a lot of pessimism about emerging markets, and I see it more likely that we ’ll see 
moderate growth and a pickup there.  Of course, there are geopolitical risks —the Middle East , 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 21  
 developments in Iraq, of course.  T hey’re not only a humanitarian concern; they are a concern 
with respect , potentially , to energy supplies and prices, and so I would certainly list that as 
something in the category of risks to the outlook.  
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes with Fox Business, ma ’am.  Can I —just to follow up a 
little bit on what Pedro asked about.  Specifically, what about equity markets?  I mean, right 
now, today, the S&P 500 is on track to close at a —another record high.  You have said that you 
have not seen any evidence of bubbles in equity markets, and that they have been trading within historic norms.  Is that still the case today?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So I don’ t have a sense—the Committee doesn’ t try to gauge what is 
the right level of equity prices.  But we do certain ly monitor a number of different metrics that 
give us a feeling for where valuations are relative to things like earnings or dividends, and look at where these metrics stand in comparison with previous history to get a sense of whether or not 
we’re moving to valuation levels that are outside of historical norms, and I still don’ t see that.   I 
still don’ t see that for equity prices broadly.  
ANNALYN KURTZ.  Annalyn Kurtz with CNNMoney.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  I’m 
wondering:  What ’s the Fed ’s general expect ation for wage growth this year and next year?  And 
if inflation outpaces wage growth, does that scenario make you more hesitant to raise the federal funds rate next year?   Or if, conversely, wages rise just enough to keep up with inflation, they ’re 
moving in lockstep, let ’s say, is that enough to satisfy what you’re looking for in the  job market?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks.  That ’s a great question.  You know, I see 
compensation growth, broadly speaking , as having been very well contained.   By most  measures, 
compensation growth is running around 2 percent.  So that ’s real wage growth or real 
compensation growth that ’s essentially flat rather than rising, and real wage growth really has 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 21  
 not been rising in line with productivity.  My own expectation i s that as the labor market begins 
to tighten, we will see wage growth pick up some to the point where real wage growth, where 
compensation or nominal wages are rising more rapidly than inflation, so households are getting a real increase in their take -home  pay.  And within limits —well, that might be signs of a tighter 
labor market.  Within limits, it’ s not a threat to inflation because consistent with the level of 
inflation we have for our 2 percent inflation objective, we could see wages growing at a more rapid rate and—a somewhat more rapid rate—a nd, indeed, that would be part of my forecast of 
what we would see as the labor market picks up.  If we were to fail to see that, frankly , I would 
worry about downside risk to consumer spending.  So I think part of my confidence in  the fact 
that we ’ll see a pickup in growth relates to the fact that I think consumer spending will continue 
to grow at a healthy rate.  And , in part, that ’s premised on some pickup in the rate of wage 
growth so that it’ s rising greater —more than inflation. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.   Today ’s statement 
repeated a phrase that ’s been used —that the C ommittee has been using , that there’ s likely to be a 
“considerable ” period between the end of the bond purchases and the first hike in the federal 
funds rate.  In March, you gave us some guidance to help—trying to help us to understand that 
by saying that that—it’ s hard to define, but it could mean six months.  Is that a time  frame that 
you feel —still feel comfortable with?   And , if you feel like it needs to be modified, do you—
could you give us an assessment of —the market seemed to expect a rate, the first rate hike in the 
second half of next year .  Is that a good assessment?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So what I want to say, the guidance that I want to give you, is that 
there is no mechanical formula whatsoever for what a “ considerable time ” means.  The answer as 
to what it means is , it depends.  It depends on how the economy progresses.  The C ommittee said 
June 18, 2014  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 21  
 very clearly in their s tatement that what they would be looking at and deciding on the timing of 
interest rate increases would be the progress we ’re making in achieving our objectives, how far 
we are from achieving our labor market objective and our inflation objective , and that  we will be 
assessing that progress, and that ’s the key determinant of when interest rate increases are likely 
to come.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.   Next year?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  There is no mechanical formula.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  The re was a report this 
week , in a salmon -colored newspaper I won ’t mention , that the Fed is thinking about —and 
regulators in Washington are thinking about —an exit fee for bond mutual funds.  This has 
sparked a lot of comments.  Would you care to comment on t his?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   I am not aware of any discussion of that topic inside the Federal 
Reserve, and my understanding is that that is a matter that is under the purview of the SEC.

September 17, 2014 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  The Federa l Open Market Committee concluded its 
meeting earlier today and, as usual, released it s monetary policy statement.  The Committee also 
released a document describing the approach the Committee intends to take  when, at some point 
in the future, it becomes appropriate to be gin normalizing the stance of policy.  Let me 
underscore that our release of this information is not meant to convey any change in the stance of 
policy.  As you know, the FOMC’s views on policy are conveyed in the policy statement, which 
I will now discuss before coming back to our normalization plans.  
As indicated in our policy statement, the FO MC decided to make another reduction in the 
pace of its asset purchases.  The Committee also maintained its forward guidance regarding the 
federal funds rate target and rea ffirmed its view that a highly ac commodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  Let me discuss the economic conditions that underpin these actions. 
The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum 
sustainable employment.  In the labor market , conditions have improved further in recent 
months.  Although the pace of job growth has sl owed some recently, job gains have averaged 
more than 200,000 per month over the past th ree months.  The unemployment rate was 
6.1 percent in August, two-tenths lower than the data available at  the time of the June FOMC 
meeting.  Broader measures of labor market u tilization, such as the U-6 measure, have shown 
similar improvement, and the labor force part icipation rate has flattened out.  These 
developments continue the trend of gradual progr ess toward our employment objective.  But the 
labor market has yet to fully recover.  There are still too many people who want jobs but cannot 
find them, too many who are working part time but  would prefer full-ti me work, and too many 
who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market we re stronger.  As noted in the 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 2 of 22 FOMC statement, “a range of labor market indica tors suggests that there remains significant 
underutilization of labor resources.” 
The Committee continues to see sufficient und erlying strength in the economy to support 
ongoing improvement in the labor market.  Althou gh real GDP rose at an annual rate of only 
about 1 percent in the first half of  the year, that modest gain reflect ed, in part, transitory factors, 
including a dip in net exports .  Indeed, private domestic final demand—that is, spending by 
domestic households and businesse s—grew about twice as fast as  GDP.  Indicators of spending 
and production for the third quarter suggest that  economic activity is expanding at a moderate 
pace, and the Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of growth going forward.  
Inflation has been running below the Committ ee’s 2 percent objective, but with longer-
term inflation expectations appearing to be we ll anchored and the economic recovery continuing, 
the Committee expects inflation to move gradua lly back toward its ob jective.  Moreover, 
inflation has firmed some since earlier in the year, and the Co mmittee believes that the likelihood 
of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished.  As is always the case, the 
Committee will continue to assess incoming data careful ly to ensure that policy is consistent with 
attaining the FOMC’s longer-run goals of maxi mum employment and inflation of 2 percent. 
This outlook is reflected in the individua l economic projections submitted in conjunction 
with this meeting by the FOMC participants , which, for the first time, go through 2017.  As 
always, each participant’s projections are cond itioned on his or her own view of appropriate 
monetary policy.  The central tendency of the une mployment rate projections is slightly lower 
than in the June projections and now stands at  5.9 to 6.0 percent at th e end of this year.  
Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declining to its longer-run normal level over the course of 2016 a nd edging a bit below that level in 2017.  The central tendency of 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 3 of 22 the projections for real GDP growth is 2.0 to 2.2 percent for 2014, down slightly from the June 
projections.  Over the next three years, the proj ections for real GDP growth run somewhat above 
the estimates of longer-run normal growth.  Finally, FOMC participants con tinue to see inflation 
moving gradually back toward 2 percent.  The ce ntral tendency of the inflation projections is 
1.5 to 1.7 percent in 2014, rising to 1.9 to 2 percent in 2017. 
As I noted earlier, the Committee decided today to make another reduction in the pace of 
asset purchases.  Two years ago, when the FOMC began this purchase program, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, and prog ress in lowering it was expected to be much 
slower than desired without a dditional policy accommodation.  The intent of the program was to 
achieve a substantial improvement in  the outlook for the labor market and to ensure that inflation 
was moving back toward the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent.  In light of the 
cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor 
market conditions since the inception of the progr am, and with the likelihood of inflation running 
persistently below 2 percent having diminished somewhat, we have reduced our pace of asset 
purchases again at this meeti ng.  Starting next month, we w ill be purchasing $15 billion of 
securities per month, down $10 billion per month fr om our current rate.  If incoming information 
broadly supports the Committee’ s expectation of ongoing improveme nt in the labor market and 
inflation moving back over time toward its 2 percent longer-run objective, the Committee will end this program at our next meeting. 
The Committee will continue its policy of re investing proceeds fr om maturing Treasury 
securities and principal payments from holdings  of agency debt and MBS.  The Committee’s 
sizable holdings of longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative financial 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 4 of 22 conditions and promote further progress toward  our objectives of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.   
Regarding interest rates, the Committee rea ffirmed its forward guidance “that it likely 
will be appropriate to maintain the current ta rget range for the federal funds rate for a 
considerable time after the asset purchase prog ram ends, especially if projected inflation 
continues to run below the Committee’s 2 per cent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well anchored.”   This judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of 
realized and expected progress toward its obj ectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation—an assessment that is based on a wide  range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indicators  of inflation pressures and infl ation expectations, and readings 
on financial developments.  Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it is the 
Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, for so me time, warrant keeping the target federal 
funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. 
This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the 
participants’ projections.  As I will explain in a moment, the FOMC now anticipates that it will 
continue to establish a target range, rather than  a single point, for the federal funds rate when 
normalization begins, and the dots in the chart I’ve distributed now  show, for each participant, 
the midpoint of this target range.  Notably, al though the central tenden cy of the unemployment 
rate in late 2016 is slightly below its estimat ed longer-run value, and the central tendency for 
inflation is close to our 2 percen t objective, the median projection fo r the federal funds rate at the 
end of 2016, at 2.9 percent, remains nearly a pe rcentage point below the longer-run value of 
3¾ percent or so projected by mo st participants.  Although FOMC participants provide a number 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 5 of 22 of explanations for the federal funds rate running  below its longer-run normal level at that time, 
many cite the residual effects of the financia l crisis, which, although slowly diminishing, are 
likely to continue to restrain household spe nding, constrain credit availability, and depress 
expectations for future growth in output and inco mes.  As these factors dissipate further, most 
participants expect the federal funds rate to m ove close to its longer-run normal level by the end 
of 2017. 
Let me reiterate, however, that the Committee’s expectations for the path of the federal 
funds rate are contingent on the economic outlook.  If the economy proves to be stronger than 
anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and 
inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases  in the federal funds rate are likely to occur 
sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged.  Conversely, if  economic performance 
disappoints, increases in the federal funds rate are likely to take place later and to be more 
gradual. 
Let me now turn to our statement on “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.”  This 
statement is intended to provide information to  the public about the eventual normalization 
process; it does not signal a change in the curr ent or future stance of monetary policy.  As is 
always the case in setting policy, the FOMC  will determine the timing and pace of policy 
normalization so as to promote its statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability. 
Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has been providing extraordinary accommodation 
using nontraditional tools of monetary policy.  The FOMC’s intention has always been to return 
to a more traditional approach, and throughout th is period, the Committee ha s been preparing for 
the normalization process.  In June 2011, the Co mmittee set out some broad principles and some 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 6 of 22 more specific tactics for how it e nvisioned the normalization process to take place.  In June 2013, 
we noted that conditions had ch anged significantly in ways not  anticipated in June of 2011, 
including the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet, a nd that some revision of those 
earlier plans was appropriate.  The document released today reflects our updated plans, which, 
readers of our minutes will know, have been unde r discussion for the last few FOMC meetings.  
The new approach retains many broad objectives a nd principles from the original but also has 
some new elements.   
As was the case before the crisis, the Committ ee intends to adjust the stance of monetary 
policy during normalization primarily through acti ons that influence the level of the federal 
funds rate and other short-term interest rates,  not through active management of the balance 
sheet.  The federal funds rate will serve as the ke y rate to communicate the stance of policy.  To 
begin normalization, the Committee will raise its ta rget range for the federal funds rate.  The 
Committee expects that the effectiv e federal funds rate may vary within the targ et range, and 
could even move outside of that range on occas ion, but such movements should have no material 
effect on financial conditions  or the broader economy. 
The primary tool for moving the federal funds rate  into the target range will be the rate of 
interest paid on excess reserves, or IOER.  The Committee expects that the federal funds rate will 
trade below the IOER rate while reserves are so  plentiful, as is the case at present.  The 
Committee also intends to use an  overnight reverse repurchase agreemen t facility, which, by 
transacting with a broad set of c ounterparties, will help ensure that  the federal funds rate remains 
in the target range.  I would like to emphasize that the overnight RRP facility will only be used to 
the extent necessary and will be  phased out when no longer needed to help control the federal 
funds rate.  In addition, the Committee will adjust th e particular settings of  these tools as needed, 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 7 of 22 and could deploy other supplementary tools as well, to ensure that we achieve our desired stance 
of policy.   
Turning now to our plans regarding the Fed’ s balance sheet, the Committee intends to 
reduce securities holdings in a gradual and predic table manner, primarily by ceasing to reinvest 
repayments of principal on securi ties held in the System Open Market Account.  Regarding the 
timing for ceasing reinvestments, the Committee now  expects this to occur after the initial 
increase in the target range for the federa l funds rate.  The Committee currently does not 
anticipate selling agency mortgage-backed securities as part  of the normalization process, 
although limited sales might be warranted in th e longer run to reduce or eliminate residual 
holdings.  The timing and pace of such sales wo uld be communicated to the public in advance.   
It’s the Committee’s intention th at the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more 
securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that these 
securities will primarily cons ist of Treasury securities. 
As I stated earlier, today’ s release of the Committee’s upda ted normalization plans is in 
no way intended to signal a change in the stance of  monetary policy.  Rather, it is meant simply 
to provide information about how the Committee e nvisions the normalization process in light of 
the changes in economic and financial circumstances  that have occurred since we put forth our 
original plans more than three years ago.  That said, conditions could change further, and we will 
learn about our tools during norma lization.  The Committee has agreed that it is prepared to 
make additional adjustments to its normalizatio n plans if warranted by economic and financial 
developments.  
Thank you.  Let me stop there.  I’ll be happy to take your questions. 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 8 of 22 STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Chair Yellen, there was some debate going into this 
meeting about the phrase “considerable time,” and whether it would remain in the statement.  I 
want to know if you could tell me just a couple things about it.  First, was it debated at the 
FOMC as to whether or not it should be includ ed?  And, I’m sorry, we’ve been over this before, 
but what does it mean timewise?  And that’s just two questions.  I have ju st a couple more here.  
Is the statement a form of forward guidance?  An d, finally, how do you square this idea of a date 
when you and others on the FOMC have continuous ly said that you’re data dependent to the 
point where, if the data were to turn, would it not necessarily be a considerable time until you 
raise rates?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, of cour se, the Committee discussed its forward guidance today, 
and it discusses what the appropria te forward guidance is at every meeting.  This is part of our 
assessment of economic conditions and the appropri ate stance of monetary policy.  In terms of 
what the term “considerable time” means, th e Committee decided that, based on its assessment 
of economic conditions, that charac terization remains appropriate, a nd it was comfortable with it.  
I think if you look, for example, at the projections of  individual participants that are revealed in 
the SEP—well, that’s the view of each participant, and, again, I’d emphasize, not a Committee 
collective view—there  is relatively little cha nge in the assessment of the outlook by participants 
between this meeti ng and the assessment in June.  So th e outlook is little changed—a slight 
decline in the anticipated path of the unemploymen t rate and a very slight  uptick in the inflation 
projection, but really quite minimal.  So, the ou tlook hasn’t changed that much from June, and 
the Committee felt comfortable with this characterization. 
Now, you said, “Isn’t this calendar-based guida nce?”  I want to emphasize that there is no 
mechanical interpretation of what the term “considerable time” means.  And, as I’ve said 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 9 of 22 repeatedly, the decisions that th e Committee makes about what is th e appropriate time to begin to 
raise its target for the federal funds rate will be data de pendent.  And in my opening comments 
just now, I again emphasized something I’ve said prev iously, which is that if  the pace of progress 
in achieving our goals were to quicken, if it we re to accelerate, it’s likely that the Committee 
would begin raising its target fo r the federal funds rate sooner th an is now anticipated and might 
raise—might then raise the federal funds rate at a faster pace.  And the opposite is also true, if 
the projection were to change.  So there is no fi xed mechanical interpreta tion of a time period.   
I think it would not be accura te to describe the Committee’ s guidance about the timing of 
the federal funds rate and when it will move a bove zero as being calendar based.  The Committee 
has started with a broad general statement of wh at determines how long it will keep the federal 
funds rate target at zero.  It has said that it will be looking at  the actual and projected pace at 
which the gaps between our employment and infl ation, and our goals for those variables, are 
closing.  And then what the Committee does at ea ch meeting is—after saying that the assessment 
will take into account many different indicators and take into account inflation pressures and 
other things—it goes on to provide at that meeting its assessment of the im plications of its view 
of the data at that time.  And that assessmen t really hasn’t change d over the last several 
meetings.  The Committee, based on its assessmen t at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying 
that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to 
maintain the current target range for a consider able time after the asset purchase program ends, 
especially if inflation remains below the 2 percen t objective.  So I wouldn’ t describe that as—I 
know “considerable time” sounds like it’s a calendar concept, but it is highly  conditional, and it’s 
linked to the Committee’s assessment of the economy. 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 10 of 22 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Sc hneider with Reuters.  Thank you.  So 
if you would help us, I mean, square the circle a little bit—because havi ng kept the guidance the 
same, having referred to signi ficant underutilization of labor, having actually pushed GDP 
projections down a little b it, yet the rate path gets steeper and seems to be consolidating higher—
so if it’s data dependent, what accounts for the fa ster projections on rate increases if the data 
aren’t moving in that direction? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, the grow th projections for 2014 are down a little bit, but the 
unemployment path is also marginally lower.  So  while the projected path of the labor market—
unemployment and other measures of the labor market—of course is partly dependent on the 
growth outlook, it isn’t totally dependent on th e growth outlook.  And the Committee assesses 
that the labor market is conti nuing to improve, and you see a sma ll reduction in the path of the 
unemployment this year and then over the rest of the projection period.   
So, if you ask me—you asked me, “Why has the projected funds rate path moved up?”  
Well, you know, each participant knows the reason th ey wrote down what they did.  But, as a 
guess, I would hazard—first, I woul d say, there is relatively little  upward movement in the path, 
and I would view it as broadly in line with what  one would expect with a very small downward 
reduction in the path for unemployment and a very  slight upward change in the projection for 
inflation.  So, most participants, in deciding on the path, I think, look at, as our guidance says, 
how large is the gap between pe rformance of the labor market and that associated with our 
maximum employment objective, how large is the gap between inflation and our 2 percent 
objective, how fast will those gaps change.  And you see in the projections very modest 
reductions in the size of those gaps and modest—ve ry small change of a slightly faster pace at 
which those gaps would change.  I would describe  the change in the projections, both for the 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 11 of 22 economy and the path of rates, as quite modest.  But the fact that they move does illustrate the 
data-dependence principle that I think is really so  important for market participants to keep in 
mind, that what we do will depend on how the data unfold.  There is uncertainty about that.  And 
as expectations and the actual performance of  the economy change, you should expect to see 
movements in the dots. 
I think it’s also notable that the further you go out in the projection period, the wider the 
set of dots.  You see a big range out in 2017, and that reflects, in part , different forecasts by 
different members of the Committee about how rapid progress will be.  What you don’t see in 
the dot—so-called dot plot is also the uncertainty  that each individual, each participant, sees 
around their own projection.  So things will de pend on how the economy evolves.  That will 
change over time, and there’s a good deal  of uncertainty a ssociated with it. 
CHRIS CONDON.  Thank you, Madam Chai r.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  
Madam Chair, the economy has been growing now for five years, and some economists believe 
the expansion will last another five years.  W hy, in your view, is economic growth not creating 
more inflation in wages and in PCE?  Is this al l about remaining slack in the labor market, or are 
there other forces at play? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, to my mi nd, the very slow pace of wage increases does reflect 
slack in the labor market.  We had a very deep recession, as is perhaps to be expected in the 
aftermath of a very significant financial cr isis.  We’ve faced headwinds in the economy 
recovering, so the recovery has be en slow.  Growth has been positive, and it’s lasted for five 
years.  But it’s nevertheless been slow relative to  past recoveries that have not been associated 
with financial crises.  And while unemployment has come way down from the slightly over 10 percent level it reached, at 6.1 percent, it remains significantly above the level that most 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 12 of 22 FOMC participants would regard as consistent with normal in the longer run, 5.2 to 5.5 percent.  
So there is significant underutilizat ion of labor resources.  We continue to discuss whether or not 
the unemployment rate itself is  an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor 
resources there really is.  And, as I went into de tail in Jackson Hole and w on’t repeat all of that 
there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels  that have come down 
only very marginally of part-time employ ment for economic—or involuntary part-time 
employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of la bor force participation as a result of cyclical 
factors.  And so, I think there still is—and the statement says it—“significant underutilization of 
labor resources” and a very modest pace of wage in creases that’s picked up very little, I see as 
essentially a reflection of that. 
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, I want 
to come back to the interest rate projections  that the Fed put out today.  The public, I think, 
would be enlightened by knowing a bit more about where you stand in relation to these 
projections.  And with that in mind, and in th e name of transparenc y, I wonder if you could 
describe to us whether you’re at the low end of those projections, within the central tendency, or 
at the high end.  I also want to ask you about a San Francisco Fed paper that came out recently, 
which suggested that market expectations have  been running below the Fed’s own projections.  
So I wanted to ask you if you see that as well, and whether it’s at all troubling that market 
expectations might not be aligned with the central—with what the Fed put out today. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, with respect to id entifying myself, the Committee has had 
discussions during the years that we have been pr oviding these forecasts of the participants to the 
public as to whether or not it’s desirable fr om the standpoint of Committee functioning to 
identify who’s who in these pictures.  And thus fa r, while occasionally an individual will indicate 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 13 of 22 in a speech what their personal views are, we ha ve not yet decided that it would be a desirable 
thing for the point of view of our decisionmaki ng process to identify individuals.  We have a 
subcommittee on communications that’s now chaire d by Vice Chair Fischer, and they will be 
considering the SEP and whether or not some cha nges are appropriate.  Bu t until and unless there 
is some change in the Committee stance on this, I don’t want to identify myself. 
You asked, second, about the San Francisco Fed paper that did point to a notable 
divergence between market views a nd the views of the Committee.  I’d say that there have been 
any number of different analyses of this topic,  there are many different survey measures and 
interpretations of what the market thinks.  And I don’t frankly think it’s completely clear that 
there is a gap.  There are different views on whether or not such a gap exists .  To the extent that 
there is a gap, one reason for it could be that ma rkets and participants ha ve different views on the 
evolution of economic conditions.  For example, I think I’d note that when the Committee participants write down their forecast for the fede ral funds rate, they are showing the funds rate 
path that they consider most likely.  Their ec onomic forecasts are of the conditions that they 
think are the most likely ones.  You don’t see the full range of possibilities there.  And the path 
for the funds rate is the path that each individu al thinks is most likely.  Market participants, 
understanding that there are a range of po ssible outcomes, with upside and downside 
possibilities, are doing something slightly differe nt, I think, when they’r e determining market 
prices.  They are taking into account the po ssibility that there can be different economic 
outcomes, including—even if they’re not ve ry likely—ones in which outcomes will be 
characterized by low inflation or low growth a nd the appropriate path of rates will be low. 
So, differences in probabilities of different outcomes can explain part of that.  We, you 
know, want to learn, we—market participants may have different views on the economy than the 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 14 of 22 Committee does, and that’s something we want to try to infer and learn ma rket views, in part 
from information of this type.  What I can say is that it is important for market participants to 
understand what our likely response  or reaction function is to the data, and our job is to try to 
communicate as clearly as we can the way in which our policy stance will depend on the data, 
and I promise to try to do that. 
YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan Mui, Washington Post .  My question is about the new exit 
principles.  You guys say that you don’t plan to e nd reinvestments until after the first rate hike.  
Can you give us a little bit of a sense of what are the condition s you’re going to be looking for 
when you eventually begin to end the reinvestments?   It sounds like tapering the reinvestments is 
also on the table.  What might go into your deci sion on whether or not to end them altogether, 
whether or not to taper them?  And do you have  a general timeline for how long you think it will 
take to shrink the balance sheet once you actually start? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  All good questions.  So, I think the Committee would—will 
be focused on—we intend to use the path of short- term interest rates as our key tool of policy.  
And, of course, market participan ts will be very focused, as we are, on what is the appropriate 
timing and pace of interest rate increases when  that time comes.  And I think the Committee 
would like to feel that it ha s successfully begun the normalization process and that we’re 
successfully communicating with ma rkets about how that process wi ll be playing out over time.  
And I think when the Committee is comfortable that  that process is established, is working well, 
and we’re comfortable with the outlook, that they  will begin the process of ceasing—or possibly 
tapering—but eventually ceasing reinvestments. 
So, we say that it will depend on economic and financial conditions, but we want to make 
sure normalization is successfu lly under way.  If we were only to shrink our balance sheet by 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 15 of 22 ceasing reinvestments, it would probably take—to get back to levels of reserve balances that we 
had before the crisis—I’m not sure we will go that  low, but we’ve said that we will try to shrink 
our balance sheet to the lowest levels consistent with the efficient and effective implementation 
of policy—it could take to the end of  the decade to achieve those levels. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  You said a few mo ments ago that there is perhaps some 
remaining shortfall of labor for ce participation as a result of cy clical factors.  This seems 
consistent with a recent paper by some memb ers of your staff finding that labor force 
participation is unlikely to recove r.  Is that now the “house” view that slack essentially consists 
of unemployment plus part-time workers who want full-time work, and that labor force participation is basically out of the equation? 
And the second question—in the statement of ex it principles, you said that the Committee 
will act as soon as economic conditions warrant.  Th ere had been an idea in circulation at some 
point that you might stay lower for longer as a means of compensating for some of the damage 
done during the recession.  Is this an indication that that debate has been settled, and that that 
idea is off the table? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m sorry.  Ju st remind me, what was the first question?  The first 
question— 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The first question was— CHAIR YELLEN.  Please.  BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The first question wa s, has the labor force participation— 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Ah, labor force participation— 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  —been removed from the slack equation? 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 16 of 22 CHAIR YELLEN.  So the recent Brookings paper by the Fed economists clearly 
indicates, and I said this at Jackson Hole, th at there are structural  reasons, particularly 
demographics but not only demographics, why la bor force participation should be expected to 
decline over time.  And I agree with that, and I be lieve that most of my colleagues would endorse 
that as well.  However, they did indicate that, in the paper, that they see some remaining cyclical 
shortfall.  By one technique that they used, th ey placed the estimate at ¼ percent, but by another 
technique that they used it could be, I believe they  said, as large as 1 percent.  And so my own 
personal view is that there is some cyclical shortfall, and something certainly—probably within that range.  But nevertheless, it’s  a meaningful cyclical shortfa ll.  It’s not completely—so I’m 
giving my own personal view, not a Committee assessment—that, you know, I see the flat—and 
given the underlying downward trend in labor force particip ation, we might interpret the 
flattening out of labor force par ticipation over the last year as  showing that that cyclical 
component has diminished somewhat.  I think ther e is something that remains, but eventually I 
would certainly agree with the authors, we  should expect over time to see labor force 
participation declining.  And then, let’s see, the s econd piece was— 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Is the debate about lower-for-longer essentially over? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you know, we stayed low for a very long time.  We have been 
at zero for a very long time and below the leve ls that some common policy rules would now be 
suggesting, given the level of unemployment and infl ation.  So the recovery has been very slow.  
We’ve also been doing unconventional policies, of course, buying assets.  And in a general 
sense, I think we have been lower for longe r than—if you complete that sentence—than many 
standard policy rules would suggest.  So, in a sens e, that is a policy that we have had.  And once 
we decide it’s appropriate to be gin to normalize policy and to rais e the level of our target for 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 17 of 22 short-term interest rates, it would still take some  time for rates to get back to levels—you can see 
in our projection that by the end of 2017, the partic ipants are, on average,  projecting that rates 
will reach the levels they consider normal in the longer run.  And, similarly, we could make a 
similar statement with respect to where th e funds rate would stand relative to the 
recommendations of rules.  So that would take some time to return to those kinds of levels. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Thank you.  Marty Crut singer with the Associated Press.  
Madam Chair, there were two dissents from toda y’s decision.  I’d kind of like to get your 
thinking on how you treat dissents.  I think in Chairman Bernanke ’s eight years, the largest 
number of dissents was three.  Do you see two dissents as a yellow-warning flashing light that 
policy may need to be moderated down the road ?  How should market participants read the 
dissents? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think it’s very natu ral that the Committee should have a range 
of opinion about a decision as crucial as what is  the right time to begin to normalize policy, and 
we do have a range of views in the Committee.   I don’t consider two dissents to be an 
abnormally large number.  Presidents Plosser and Fisher have been quite clear in all of their 
speeches recently in stating that they think the time has come to begin normalizing policy.  I 
think they, perhaps, have some concerns that if we don’t begin to do so soon that inflation will pick up above levels we—that they would consider desirable, or that they have some financial 
stability concerns.  But the Co mmittee adopted today’s statemen t by an overwhelming majority, 
and I don’t consider the level of dissent  to be surprising or very abnormal. 
GREG IP.  Greg Ip of The Economist .  There’s been another downgrade in your near-
term growth forecast and a downgrade in your unemployment rate path forecast.  Does it appear 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 18 of 22 that potential is much lower than you thought, a nd therefore slack is closing more quickly than 
you thought?  This seems to be a pers istent pattern to your forecasts.  
Secondarily, how concerned are you about even ts in Europe and especially the recent 
decline in inflation expectations there? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So there’s been  a little bit of dow ngrading, I think, ev en this time in 
the longer-run normal growth rates that Committ ee participants have written down.  You are 
certainly right in saying that over a number of y ears now, there’s been a pa ttern of forecast errors 
in which either we’ve been on track with resp ect to unemployment or unemployment has come 
down in some cases faster than we anticipated, and yet growth has pretty persistently been 
surprising the Committee to the downside.  And th at is a statement about  productivity growth, 
which has been pretty disappointing.  So we have had downward revisions in the level of 
potential output and to some exte nt, at least for a time, in the pr ojected pace of growth.  So that 
tension has been there.  
There are a range of views about long-run grow th.  A lot of people are writing about this 
topic.  I think the Committee’s longer-run estimates are neither at the most pessimistic end nor 
the most optimistic end. 
GREG IP.  I had a question about Europe. CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, about Eu rope.  Well, I mean, you know, certainly we have 
discussed the outlook for Europe—the very low leve l of inflation that they have seen recently 
and the decline that they saw in inflationary expectat ions, in the slow pace of growth.  It is one of 
a number of risks to the global economy, and we cer tainly hope that they will be successful in 
seeing the pace of growth and inflation pick up, and I think that will be good for the global 
economy and the United States. 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 19 of 22 ROBIN HARDING.  Robi n Harding from the Financial Times .  Madam Chair, I want to 
come back to the forward guidance.  Quite a larg e part of the Committee has recently criticized 
the guidance as being calendar based.  But if I understood your comments earlier, that’s not 
correct.  How should people understand it?  And if it doesn’t have a defined meaning, what 
purpose is it actually serving?  And do you expect to  have to revisit it in the near future?  Thank 
you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we are c onstantly discussing forward guidance and thinking about 
whether it’s appropriate and how to revise it.  And we did do a major overhaul of our forward 
guidance in March.  I think the Committee part icipants who have spoken out on this topic 
recently want to make sure that we have the fl exibility—that the Committee has the flexibility to 
respond to unfolding developments.  They want to ma ke sure that if progre ss really does turn out 
to be faster than we have—we would expect, th at the Committee will be in a position to start 
sooner tightening monetary policy.  They do not wa nt to be locked into something that the 
markets see as a calendar-based and firm commitment.  And so they want to emphasize data 
dependence of our policy and make sure that we have appropriate flexibil ity.  But I agree with 
that.  And, as I said earlier, I think we do not ha ve any mechanical interpretation that applies to 
this.  It, of course, gives an impression about wh at we think will be appropriate, but there is no 
mechanical interpretation.  And I’ve said repeat edly, and I want to say again, that if events 
surprise us, and we’re moving more quickly to ward our objectives, and the Committee sees a 
need to move sooner or later depending on what th e data is, that we do f eel—I do feel we have 
the flexibility to move.  And it is important fo r markets to understand that there is uncertainty, 
and this statement is not some sort of firm promise about a particular amount of time. 
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 20 of 22 STEVEN BECKNER.  Good afte rnoon, Chair Yellen.  Getting b ack to the one aspect of 
the forward guidance is the statement, which you’ ve reiterated about the funds rate probably 
needing to stay below normal for some time  after achieving mandate-consistent levels on 
unemployment, inflation, and so forth.  The SEP assessments of appropriate funds rate levels 
show the funds rate getting up to that 3.75 percen t normal level at the en d of 2017.  If you look at 
the SEP projections of unemployment, inflation, a nd so forth, they seem to get back to those 
mandate-consistent levels by the end of 2016, if not mu ch sooner.  So what is the justification for 
waiting that much longer to get back to normal, particularly when you have such a large balance 
sheet that you intend to reduce onl y gradually?  Is there a danger  of getting behind the curve? 
And, secondly, can I just ask, can you envision a time when, to reduce reserve pressures, 
you may have to resort to asset sa les that you don’t anticipate doing now? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So on the first question of “some time” before rates return to normal 
levels, as I mentioned, you can see in the SEP that by the end of 2017, many participants are 
anticipating that rates will return to what they think ar e normal longer-ru n levels, but the 
economy, in their view, will have probably gotten back to normal levels of unemployment and 
near-normal levels of inflation sometime in 2016.  So that looks like a year or more in which rates would be below normal longer-run levels. 
We asked participants why they hold the view s that they do about appropriate policy, and 
there are a number of different e xplanations that participants give .  But a common view on this is 
that there have been a variety of headwinds resulti ng from the crisis that have slowed growth, led 
to a sluggish recovery from the crisis, and that  these headwinds will dissipate only slowly, that 
they are dissipating—an example wo uld be the fact that mortgage credit really is, at this point, 
available really to those with pristine credit .  Credit conditions there are abnormally tight.  
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 21 of 22 Another thing that we se e is that households’ exp ectations about their likely income paths remain 
quite depressed relative to pre-crisis levels .  That’s something that may be holding back 
consumer spending.  So the view would be that  those forces will dissipate over time, but only 
very gradually.  In addition, we have had slow  productivity growth, and a slow pace of potential 
output likely depresses the pace of investment sp ending.  And so, those are some of the things 
that participants mention as why it will take some time to get back. 
So the story is, it’s not that the Fed is behind the curve in fa iling to return the funds rate 
to normal levels when the economy is recovered.  It is rather th at, in order to achieve such a 
recovery in 2016 or by the end, that it’s necessary  and appropriate to have a somewhat more 
accommodative policy than would be normal in the absence of those headwinds. 
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes of Fox Busi ness, ma’am.  I would like to follow up on 
Greg’s question about Europe, because to morrow Scotland is going to be voting on 
independence from Great Britain, and there’s some  concern that if it do es vote to break from 
Great Britain, that this could cause some turmoil in global fi nancial markets and the global 
economy.  Are you concerned about that?  Do you see any impact if Scotland does vote for independence on the European economy and poten tially on the American economy?  And, if so, 
is the Fed doing anything in prepar ation for that possibility?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, Scottish  voters are about to go to the polls tomorrow, and 
they’ve had a good debate about this topic.  And in light of that, I really don’t want to weigh in 
on this today. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.  Thank you.  Pedro da Costa with Dow Jones Newswires.  My 
question is about your particular views about whether a gradual appr oach to tightening is better 
than a more aggressive and less predictable one, because there was some discussion about—
September 17, 2014   Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 22 of 22 internally and externally, about whether it was the Fed’s predicta bility in the 2004-ish period that 
kind of created the conditions of complacency th at led to the housing bubble.  So I wonder if 
you’d be more inclined to be gradualist in your approach and more transp arent in outlining future 
moves or whether you think keeping the market guessing—there’s some value to that.  Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  You know, this is somethi ng the Committee is going to have to 
discuss when the time comes to normalize polic y.  Looking back on the period, the run-up to the 
financial crisis, I don’t think, by any means, “m easured pace” and the very predictable pace of 
25 basis points per meeting explains why we had a financial crisis, but it  may have diminished 
volatility and been a small contributing factor, and the Committee will have to think about how 
to do this.  I think many people in the aftermath of that episode think that somewhat less of a 
mechanical pace would perhaps be better, but this is a matter that we will, in due time, have to 
discuss.

  Page 1 of 23  Transcript of Chair Yelle n’s FOMC Press Conference  
December 17, 2014 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  The Federa l Open Market Committee concluded its 
last meeting of the year earlier today.  As indicated in our policy statement, the FOMC 
“reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percen t target range for the federal funds rate remains 
appropriate.”  The Committee also updated its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, 
indicating that “the Committee j udges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance 
of monetary policy.”  This new language does not represent a change  in our policy intentions and 
is fully consistent with our previous guidance, wh ich stated that it likely will be appropriate to 
maintain the current target range for the federal f unds rate for a considerable time after the end of 
our asset purchase program.  But with that pr ogram having ended in October, and the economy 
continuing to make progress toward our objectives, the Committee judged that some 
modification to our guidance is appr opriate at this time.  I will ha ve more to say about our policy 
decisions in a moment, but first let me review  recent economic developments and the outlook. 
In the labor market, progress continues toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum 
employment.  The pace of job growth has been strong recently, with job gains averaging nearly 
280,000 per month over the past 3 months; over the past 12 months, job gains averaged nearly 
230,000 per month.  The unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in November, three-tenths lower 
than the latest reading availabl e at the time of the September FO MC meeting.  Broader measures 
of labor market utilization have  shown similar improvement, and the labor force participation 
rate has leveled out.  As noted  in the FOMC statement, “unde rutilization of labor resources 
continues to diminish.”  Even so, there is r oom for further improvement, with too many people 
who want jobs being unable to find them, too ma ny who are working part time but would prefer 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 2 of 23  full-time work, and too many who ha ve given up searching for a j ob but would likely do so if the 
labor market were stronger. 
The Committee continues to see sufficient und erlying strength in the economy to support 
ongoing improvement in the labor market.  Real GDP looks to have increased robustly in the 
third quarter, reflecting solid consumption and investment spendi ng.  Smoothing through the 
quarterly ups and downs earlier this year, real GDP expanded around 2½ percent over the four 
quarters ending in the third quarter, and the availa ble indicators suggest that economic growth is 
running at roughly that pace in the current quar ter.  The Committee continues to expect a 
moderate pace of growth going forward. 
Inflation has continued to r un below the Committee’s 2 percen t objective, and the recent 
sizable declines in oil prices wi ll likely hold down overall inflation in the near term.  But as the 
effects of these oil price declines  and other transitory factors dissi pate and as resource utilization 
continues to rise, the Committee expects inflation to  move gradually back toward its objective.  
In making this forecast, the Committee is mindf ul of the recent declines in market-based 
measures of inflation compensation.  At this point, the Committee vi ews these movements as 
likely to prove transitory, and survey-based measur es of longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable.  That said, developments in this area obviously bear close watching. 
This outlook is reflected in the individua l economic projections submitted in conjunction 
with this meeting by the FOMC participants.  As always, each participant’s projections are 
conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  The central tendency of the 
unemployment rate projections is slightly lowe r than in the September projections and now 
stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent at the end of next year, in line w ith its estimated longer-run normal 
level.  Committee participants generally see the unemployment rate declin ing a little further over 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 3 of 23  the course of 2016 and 2017.  The central tendency of the projections for real GDP growth is 
2.3 to 2.4 percent for 2014, up a bit from the September projections.  Over the next three years, the projections for real GDP growth run somewhat above the estimates of longer-run normal growth.  Finally, although FOMC pa rticipants project inflation in the near term to be lower on 
account of the decline in energy prices, they co ntinue to see inflation moving gradually back 
toward 2 percent.  The central tendency of the inflation projections is 1.0 to 1.6 percent next 
year, rising to 1.8 to 2.0 percent in 2017. 
As I noted earlier, the Committee “reaffirmed its view that the cu rrent 0 to ¼ percent 
target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.”  Regarding forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate, our October statement indicated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain 
the current target range for the federal funds rate  for a considerable time following the end of our 
asset purchase program, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run goal.  Today’s statement, which indicates that  “the Committee judges that it 
can be patient in beginning to normalize the stan ce of monetary policy,” does not signify any 
change in the Committee’s polic y intentions as set forth in its recent statements.  As before, this 
judgment is based on the Committee’s assessment of  realized and expected progress toward its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation—an assessment that is based on a 
wide range of information, includ ing measures of labor market c onditions, indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expectations, a nd readings on financial developments. 
Given that the Committee is not signaling a change in policy, why did we update our 
guidance?  The reason is that, with the asse t purchase program having been wound down in 
October, it seemed less helpful to continue to  communicate about the possible timing of our first 
rate increase with reference to an event that is re ceding into the past.  Inst ead, we have shifted to 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 4 of 23  language that better reflects the Committee’s focus on the economi c conditions that would make 
liftoff appropriate.  Employment is rising at a healthy rate and the U.S. economy is 
strengthening, reflecting, in part, a highly accomm odative stance of monetary policy.  Of course, 
inflation has been running somewhat below our go al of 2 percent, but we  project that gap to 
close gradually over time.  As progress in achieving maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation continues, at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy 
accommodation.  But, based on its current outlook, the Committee judges that it can be patient in 
doing so.  In particular, the Committee consider s it unlikely to begin the normalization process 
for at least the next couple of meetings. 
This assessment, of course, is completely data dependent.  If incoming information 
indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the 
Committee now expects, then increases in the target  range for the federal funds rate are likely to 
occur sooner than curren tly anticipated.  Convers ely, if progress proves sl ower than expected, 
then increases in the target range are likel y to occur later than currently anticipated. 
Once we begin to remove policy accommoda tion, it continues to be the Committee’s 
assessment that, “even after employment and in flation are near manda te-consistent levels, 
economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  This guidance is consistent with the 
paths for appropriate policy given by FOMC pa rticipants.  Assuming that the economy evolves 
broadly in line with participants’ expectations, almost all participants believe that it will be 
appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015. 
There are a range of views on the appropriate timing of liftoff within the year, in part 
reflecting differences in participants’ expectatio ns for how the economy will evolve.  By the time 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 5 of 23  of liftoff, participants expect to see some furt her decline in the unemplo yment rate and additional 
improvement in labor market conditions.  They also expect core inflat ion to be running near 
current levels but foresee being reasonably confid ent in their expectation that inflation will move 
back toward our 2 percent longer-run inflation obj ective over time.  Of course, as I previously 
emphasized, the timing of the initial rise in the fe deral funds rate target, as well as the path for 
the target thereafter,  are contingent on  economic conditions. 
By late 2016, the median projection for the federal funds rate, at 2.5 percent, remains 
more than 1 percentage point below the longer-ru n value of 3¾ percent or so projected by most 
participants, even though the centr al tendency of the unemployment rate by that time is slightly 
below its estimated longer-run value and the centr al tendency for inflation is close to our 
2 percent objective.  FOMC part icipants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds 
rate running below its normal longe r-run level at that time—in part icular, the residual effects of 
the financial crisis, which are likely to conti nue to constrain househol d spending and constrain 
credit availability for some time.  But as these f actors dissipate further, mo st participants expect 
the federal funds rate to move close to its longer-run normal level by the end of 2017. 
Finally, the Committee will continue its polic y of reinvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities and principal payments fr om holdings of agency debt and MBS.  The 
Committee’s sizable holdings of longer-term secu rities should help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions and promote further pr ogress toward our objectives of maximum 
employment and inflation of 2 percent. 
Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions.  JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, a 
number of Fed officials have proj ected in the lead-up to this m eeting that the most likely timing 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 6 of 23  for liftoff was around the middle of next year.  I wonder if you could clarify that.  You said in 
your statement that “patient” means not for at least two meetings.  Your forecast that—the 
FOMC’s forecasts seem to be consistent with something like a middle-of-the-year liftoff.  Can 
you speak to that?  And can you also speak to the downdraft we’re seeing in inflation now and, 
in particular, the market-based inflation expect ations and whether that gives the Committee any 
hesitance about proceeding towards liftoff in the months ahead? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I did say that the stat ement that the Committee can be patient 
should be interpreted as meaning that it is unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least 
the next couple of meetings.  Now, that doesn’t  point to any preset or  predetermined time at 
which normalization is—will begin.  There are a range of views on the Committee, and it will be 
dependent on how incoming data bear on the progress the ec onomy is making.   
First of all, I want to emphasize that no meeti ng is completely off the table, in the sense 
that if we do see faster progress toward our obj ectives than we currently expect, then it is 
possible that the process of nor malization would occur sooner than we now an ticipate.  And, of 
course, the converse is also true .  So, at this point, we thi nk it unlikely that it will be 
appropriate—that we will see conditions for at leas t the next couple of mee tings that will make it 
appropriate—for us to decide to begin normalizat ion.  A number of Committee participants have 
indicated that, in their view, conditions could be appropriate by the middle of next year, but there 
is no preset time.  And there are a range of vi ews as to when the appropriate conditions will 
likely fall in place.  So that’s something we will be watching closely as the year unfolds. 
You asked also, I think, about inflation.  A nd, as I mentioned in my press statement, 
especially with the downward pressures on inflat ion that we expect to see for a little while 
because of declining oil prices and falling import pr ices, we certainly expect headline inflation to 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 7 of 23  be under downward pressure for a while.  And, as I mentioned, most participants do envision that 
conditions will be appropriate sometime during th is coming year to begin normalizing policy.  
And they do largely expect that inflation will be—core inflation will probably be running close to its current level.  And headline inflation could ev en be lower.  But what they will want to have 
is a feeling of reasonabl e confidence that when we start the process of normalizing policy, that it 
will be moving up over time.  And, of course, as labor market conditions continue to improve, 
history suggests that as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that that’s likely to 
occur. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger wi th the Associated Press.  Given the—
what’s happening now with the transition with the Fed, there seems to be a pattern developing 
that the market expects big ne ws to come when you have a press conference and no news to 
come when you don’t have one.  But is that a goo d expectation?  And is  there any thought to 
starting to have a press c onference at every meeting? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would really like to di scourage that expectation.  Every meeting 
that we have is a live meeting at which th e Committee could make a policy decision.  And we 
will feel free to do so.  So I would really like to strongly disc ourage the expectation that policy 
moves can only occur when there’s a scheduled press conference.  And we have long had in 
place the ability to hold a press c onference call, rather than an in-person press conference.  And 
we did do so on a number of occasions in earlier years.  So the Committee, clearly, would want 
to be able to explain its reasoning.  As we  begin the process of normalizing policy, every 
meeting is live.  And if we were to decide at a meeting to begin to normalize policy, I expect we 
would hold a press conference call.

Page 8 of 23  STEVE LIESMAN.  Was there concern—S teve Liesman, CNBC—was there concern 
expressed at the meeting that the signal comi ng from markets—and a variety of markets—lower 
oil prices, lower yields around the world, was one of deflation, and that that risk was one that 
should, perhaps, overshadow the concer n about inflation on the other side? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks Steve.  We’re very attentive to global developments and 
certainly discuss them in the meeting.  The very s ubstantial decline we have seen in oil prices is 
one of the most important developments shaping th e global outlook.  It will have different effects 
in different regions and could well have effects on financial markets, as we are seeing.  I think 
the judgment of the Committee is that, from the standpoint of the United States and the U.S. 
outlook, that the decline we have seen in oil pri ces is likely to be, on net, a positive.  It’s 
something that’s certainly good for families, for households.  It’s putting more money in their 
pockets.  Having to spend less on gas and energy, a nd so, in that sense, it’s like a tax cut that 
boosts their spending power.  The United Stat es remains—although our production of oil has 
increased dramatically, we still remain a net importe r of oil.  Of course there may be some offset 
in the form of reduced drilling activity, and possibly some change, some reduction in cap-ex 
plans in the drilling area.  But, on balance, I w ould see these developments as a positive for the 
standpoint of the U.S. economy. 
With respect to deflation, we see downward pr essure on headline inflation from declining 
energy prices.  We certainly recognize that that  is going to be pushing down headline inflation 
and may even spill over, to some extent, to core inflation.  But, at this point, although we indicated we’re monitoring inflation developmen ts carefully, we see these developments as 
transitory.  And the Committee continues to be lieve—especially with the improvement we’re 
seeing in the labor market, which we expect to continue—that inflation will move back up to our

Page 9 of 23  2 percent objective over time.  As I indicated, we will want to feel, I believe, that people will 
expect to feel reasonably confident about th at when they—when the process of normalization 
begins.  But we do expect them to be transitory. 
ROBIN HARDING.   Robin Harding from the Financial Times .  Madame Chair, there’s a 
big gap between the pace markets expect you to rais e interest rates and th e rate you’ve indicated 
in your “dot plot.”  Are markets mis understanding your intentions?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So that’s difficult for me to  say.  What I want to say is that our 
objective is to communicate as clearly as we pos sibly can about our plans and how we see the 
economic environment unfolding.  When the pa rticipants in the Committee fill out their 
projections, they’re asked to give  the path of the federal funds rate and of the various economic 
variables that they consider most likely.  They’re not asked to talk about all the different things 
that could happen, recognizing there is uncertaint y, and the paths of the funds rate that they 
would consider appropriate if t hose other alternatives were to happen.  But other alternatives, I 
think, are priced into the market.  And one reason  that the market prices may be different than 
the Committee’s is because they place probability on other outcomes that look different than what they regard as the modal forecast.  They ma y also have a different set of expectations about 
how the—about the economic outlook and how it’s lik ely to unfold.  So I recognize that there are 
significant differences.  I can’t tell you exactly wh at they’re due to.  But what I do want to do is 
communicate as clearly as I can, on behalf of the Committee, how we think the economy’s likely 
to progress and how we would likel y set the federal funds rate over time if that forecast bears 
out. 
ROBIN HARDING.  It doesn’t make you uncomfortable, where markets are now? 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 10 of 23  CHAIR YELLEN.  There are a number of different  factors that are b earing on the path of 
market interest rates, I think, in cluding global economic developments .  It is often the case that 
when oil prices move down and the dollar apprecia tes, that that tends to put downward pressure 
on inflation compensation and on longer-term rates.  We also have safe-haven flows that may be 
affecting longer-term Treasury yields.  So I can’t tell you exactly what is driving market 
developments.  But what I can say is that we  are trying to communicat e our thoughts as clearly 
as we can. 
STEVEN MUFSON.  Hi.  Steve Mufson from the  Washington Post .  I was just hoping 
you could go into a little more detail about the oil effect.  Even though you see it as transitory, 
does that give you a little more  room to keep rates low in the next few months?  And if—
alternately, if prices bounce bac k, what’s that going to do to your  ability to change rates, and 
how might you react to that? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well I—I’d sa y, you know, that I think what we have seen since the 
mid-’80s is that, in an environment where in flation expectations ar e well anchored, that 
movements in oil and commodity pr ices and import prices tend to have transitory effects on the 
inflation outlook.  There were many years in which we  had unanticipated increa ses in oil prices,   
really beginning in 2004 and 2005, that put upwar d pressure on headline inflation and sometimes 
even spilled through into core, and, typicall y, the Committee looked through those impacts on 
inflation with the view that they would be transi tory.  And I think experience bears out that they 
were transitory.  And I think that’s the Committee’s expectati on here.  Inflation, even core 
inflation, has been running below our inflation objective.  Movements in oil, you know, now 
down and perhaps later up, will move inflation around, certainly headline inflation.  But the 
Committee, at this point, anticipates those impacts to be transitory.  So as long as participants 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 11 of 23  feel reasonably confident that the inflation pr ojection is one where we  expect to meet our 
2 percent objective ove r time, that’s what I thi nk how they’ll be looking at  things as we decide 
on the path for the funds rate. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  Does “a couple” 
mean two?  And when you talk about reasonab le confidence in infla tion expectations, can you 
elaborate a little bit a bout what it would take to give you re asonable confidence that inflation is 
headed back to 2 percent? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So “a couple”—I believe th e dictionary probably says, “a couple” 
means two.  So, “a couple” means tw o.  And with respect to infl ation—our forecast for inflation 
and inflation expectations, let me start by saying I think it’s important th at monetary policy be 
forward looking.  The lags in monetary policy are long, and, therefore, the Committee has to 
base its decisions on how to set the federal funds rate looking into the future.  Theory is 
important, and theories that are consistent with  historical evidence will be something that 
governs the thinking of many people around the table.  Typically, we have seen that as long as 
inflation expectations are well anchored, that as  the labor market recove rs, we’ll gradually see 
upward pressure on both wages and prices, and th at inflation will tend to move back toward 
2 percent.  I think historically we have see n, as the economy strengthens and slack diminishes, 
that inflation does tend to gr adually rise over time.  And as long—you know, I—just speaking 
for myself, I will be looking for evidence that I think strengthens my confidence in that view 
and, you know, looking at the full range of data th at bear on whether or not that’s a reasonable 
view of how events will unfold.  But it’s likely to be a decision  that’s based on forecasts and 
confidence in the forecast. 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 12 of 23  MICHAEL FLAHERTY.  Michael  Flaherty, Reuters News.  Chair Yellen, a lot of 
attention has been focused on liftoff.  But, I wonder, has the Committee discussed what happens 
after that liftoff and what, you know, the rate path would be after you make the first move? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I think you raise a very important poin t because, although there is 
a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to ma tter in thinking about the stance 
of policy is what the entire path of interest ra tes will look like.  And I re ally don’t have much for 
you other than to say that they will be data de pendent—that, over time, the stance of policy will 
be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a tr ack where we see contin uing progress toward 
achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.  There’s—you know, the 
federal funds rate has been sitting in the 0 to ¼ percent range now for six years.  This is—and we 
have a very large balance sheet.  We are pr oviding a very highly accommodative monetary 
policy.  And even as we begin to normalize the stance of monetary polic y, when that becomes 
appropriate, it’s important to remember that monetary policy will stil l be very accommodative 
for a long time.  And as we begin to normalize policy, we will be looking  at unfolding economic 
developments.  And as the economy strengthen s, and we come clos er to achieving our 
objectives, I think it’s very likely that we w ill, you know, progress on the path of normalizing 
policy.  But I can’t tell you, specifically, other th an saying it will depend on progress, and moves 
will be data dependent.  I can’t  say much more than that. 
GREG IP.  Chair Yellen, the Committee’ s projections show unemployment running 
below your own views on where full em ployment should be for the next several years.  Does that 
reflect a desire on the part of the Committee th at the economy run somewhat above potential for 
a while?  And, if so, can you ela borate on why it wants that and what purpose it achieves?  And, 
related to the question that Jon Hilsenrath aske d earlier, you’ve called the decline in inflation—
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 13 of 23  and market-based measures of inflation expectati ons—transitory.  But this decline has been very 
pronounced in the five-year-forward range.  So we ’re talking about expect ations that inflation 
many years from now will be below target.  And some  market participants see that as evidence of 
declining credibility in the Committee’s long-ter m objective.  Why do you still view that as 
transitory? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So you—your fi rst question is:  Why is it that the Committee sees 
unemployment as declining sligh tly below its estimate of the longer-run natura l rate?  And, I 
think, in part, the reason for that is that in flation is running below our objective, and the 
Committee wants to see inflation move back towa rd our objective over time .  And a short period 
of a very slight undershoot of unemployment below th e natural rate will facili tate a slightly faster 
return of inflation to our object ive.  It is, I should say, a very small undershoot in a situation 
where there is great uncertainty about exactly  what constitutes maximum employment or a 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  We also  do see the different measures of slack in the 
labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.  The standard 
unemployment rate, for quite some time now, has b een signaling a little bit less slack in the labor 
market than measures that are somewhat broade r that, for example, include the unusually large 
number of people who were part-time employed but  would prefer full-time jobs.  And the portion 
of the decline we’ve seen in la bor force participation, that look s like it would disa ppear in a—or 
be eroded in a stronger economy.  And so it may be  that with a very small undershoot of this 
longer-run normal level of the unemployment ra te, as measured by the standard unemployment 
rate, we’ll be seeing some further progress on those other margins of slack.  But it’s important to 
point out that the Committee is not anticipating an ove rshoot of its 2 percent inflation objective. 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 14 of 23   Oh, and longer-dated expectations.  Well, wh at I would say, we refer to this in the 
statement as “inflation compensation” rather than  “inflation expectations.”  The gap between the 
nominal yields on 10-year Treasuries, for exam ple, and TIPS have declined—that’s inflation 
compensation.  And five-year, five-year-forwards, as you’ve said, have al so declined.  That 
could reflect a change in inflati on expectations, bu t it could also reflect ch anges in assessment of 
inflation risks.  The risk prem ium that’s necessary to compen sate for inflation, that might 
especially have fallen if the proba bilities attached to very high in flation have come down.  And it 
can also reflect liquidity effects in markets.  And, for example, it’s sometimes the case that—
when there is a flight to safety, that flight te nds to be concentrated in nominal Treasuries and 
could also serve to compress that spread.  So I th ink the jury is out about exactly how to interpret 
that downward move in inflation compensation.  And we indicated that we are monitoring 
inflation developments carefully. 
PETER COOK.  Madame Chair, Peter Cook of Bloomberg Television.  I want to follow 
up, if I could, on firming going forward, on the nor malization once liftoff takes place.  I know 
you said this is going to be data dependent.  Does that suggest to markets, to those watching, that 
the measured pace we’ve seen in a previous tighten ing cycle, those quarter- point increments, that 
that’s not something markets shoul d expect?  And what’s your ow n takeaway from how effective 
that measured pace was back in th at previous tightening cycle?   
And if I could follow up just separately on the dissents at this meeti ng.  There were three 
dissents, a notable number, certainly.  What doe s that suggest about the debate around the table 
and your ability to forge consensus going forwar d?  Are you disappointed with the number of 
dissents? 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 15 of 23  CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with the number  of dissents.  There is a wide range of 
opinion in the Committee.  I think it ’s appropriate for people to be able to express their views.  
And, in a sense, you see dissents on both sides.   I think the statement does a good job of 
reflecting what the majority of the Committee th inks is appropriate policy.  So at—you know, at 
a time like this, where we are making consequential d ecisions, I think it’s ve ry reasonable to see 
divergences of opinion.  And just remi nd me, what was the other—about the— 
PETER COOK.  Measured pace. CHAIR YELLEN.  —measured pace.  There certainly has been no, you know, decision 
on the part of the Committee to move at a meas ured pace or to use language like that.  I think 
quite a few people, looking back on the use of th at language in the—I can’t remember if it was 
12 or 16 meetings, where there were 25 basis point moves.  We’d probably not like to repeat a 
sequence in which there was a measured pace and 25 basis point moves at every meeting.  So I 
certainly don’t want to encourage you to thi nk that there will be a repeat of that.  
Many members of the Committee, participants, ha ve said that they think policy should be 
based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, wh ich tends to be variable over 
time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.  We have continued to provide 
guidance, the same guidance that we have for so me time, that says the Committee “anticipates 
that, even after employment and inflation ar e near mandate-consistent levels, economic 
conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping th e target federal funds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.”   
I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in eff ect, that the Committee believes that the 
economic conditions that have made recovery di fficult, we’re getting beyond them.  They are 
optimistic that those conditions will lift.  They see the longer-run normal level of interest rates as 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 16 of 23  around 3¾ percent.  So there’s no view in the Co mmittee that there is secular stagnation in the 
sense that we won’t eventually get back to pretty historically normal levels of interest rates.  But 
they have said, it’ll, you know , the economy has required to get where it is a good deal of 
monetary policy accommodation; we expect to be  able to normalize policy.  But, until those 
conditions have lifted that have held back economic activity, mone tary policy will need to stay 
accommodative.  So, in that sense, perhaps that ’s equivalent to saying that the path of 
normalization is anticipated to be relatively gradua l.  But, again, the path of rates will depend on 
how economic conditions actually evolve, and that ’s nothing more than an expectation on the 
part of the Committee. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa with Do w Jones Newswires.  Enough about rates.  
I want to ask you about the New York Fed.  The Ne w York Fed’s been in the news a lot lately.  
President Dudley was invited to Congress to testify about conflicts  of interest there.  You had 
things like the Segarra tapes, the Beim report, and, most recently, the revelation that a former 
New York Fed official was exchanging informa tion with someone at Goldman Sachs who was 
also—had New York Fed connections.  I just w onder—and also there were  scandals during the 
crisis related to Stephen Friedman regarding the New York Fed, and his purchase of Goldman 
Sachs stock.  Do you see the New York Fed as a black mark on the Fed system because of these recurring scandals?  Have you talked to Bill Dudley  about reforming the image of that particular 
regional Fed?  And do you think a person that ha s—that spent 21 years of  his career at Goldman 
Sachs is in a position to regain public cr edibility about conf licts of interest? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, let me say that I th ink it’s very important for the Federal 
Reserve System to have confidence in the quality  of its supervision.  And I do have a good deal 
of confidence in the quality of our supervision program, fo r the banking organizations we 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 17 of 23  supervise in general, and that also applies to  the largest banking organizations.  We rely on 
examiners who are in the field and at the Re serve Banks to be provi ding information about 
what’s happening in those organizations.  But that  information feeds into a process in which it is 
not individuals at any single Reserve Bank.  But,  at the Board, it’s a Board-led process, and it 
involves senior officials at a number of different  Reserve Banks.  It’s also a multidisciplinary 
process that involves not only pe ople from supervision, but those from markets, from economic 
research.  Experts who focus on financial stability all come together to evaluate the information 
that they have and to assign supe rvisory ratings and decide on th e appropriate program for all of 
those large institutions.  We’ve strengthened th e process of supervision enormously since the 
crisis, and I feel a very good sense of confidence in how we’re carrying that out. 
Now, it is important to make sure that we ha ve fed into this process all the information 
that’s relevant to making the right decisions.  An d when there are individuals who are examiners, 
who may disagree with others in their team about how to interpre t what’s going on at a particular 
institution, it’s important that ther e be channels by which they can make sure that disagreements 
are fed up to the highest levels.  This is tr ue throughout the work we do.  We do economic 
forecasting, and our—the FOMC receives informati on to help us make decisions, but obviously 
there are disagreements about—among economists a bout how to interpret developments.  It’s 
also important for us there to make sure we unders tand alternative views.  So  this is important in 
supervision.  We’ve announced that the Board has undertaken a review of whether or not there 
are appropriate mechanisms in place in all of th e Reserve Banks that individuals who disagree 
with decisions can make their own views known and feed into the process, and we’ve also asked 
our inspector general to look into that. 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 18 of 23  JEFF KEARNS.  Thank you.  Jeff K earns from Bloomberg News.  I’d also like to get off 
monetary policy and ask you a bout the Federal Reserve’s re lationship with Congress.  
Specifically, how worried are you about legislati on that has been proposed, and may be proposed 
again in the next Congress, th at would reduce Fed independence?  Would you see yourself trying 
to fight back?  Or would you see yourself trying to  go to Congress to work with them to do more 
with transparency or something else to reduce their co ncerns without making them law?  And, if 
there were bills sent to the White  House, would you talk to the President about vetoing them?  Or 
do you have any confidence that he would veto b ills that would reduce the Fed’s independence?  
Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me simply say that Congress has assigned us  important tasks in 
monetary policy and in other role s that we perform, and the Fede ral Reserve is highly focused on 
attempting to carry out the mandates that Congress has given us in the area of monetary policy.  
It’s our dual mandate to promote maximum empl oyment and price stability, and that’s what 
we’re working on.  
You know, I would say that the ability of a central bank to make the decisions about 
monetary policy that it regards as  in the best longer-run interest s of the economy, free of short-
run political interference,  is very important to the effective conduct of monetary policy.  And I 
think that history shows, not onl y in the United States but arou nd the world, that central bank 
independence promotes better economic performan ce.  So I do think central bank independence 
is very important, and that it’s  important to make sure that we  can make the decisions we think 
are best, free of short-run political inte rference with respect to monetary policy. 
We should be accountable, and we are accountable  to Congress in explaining what we do.  
I believe strongly in transparency, and I believ e strongly that we shoul d communicate as clearly 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 19 of 23  what we are doing and the rationale for doing it , and I am very open to looking for ways 
ourselves to improve our communications and tr ansparency, and working with Congress to do 
that.  But I would be very concerned about ac tions.  Back in 1978, Congr ess explicitly passed 
legislation to ensure that there would be no GAO audits of monetary policy decisionmaking— 
namely, policy audits.  I certainly hope that will continue, and I will try to forcefully make the 
case for why that’s important. 
JEFF KEARNS.  Would it veto? CHAIR YELLEN.  I cannot speak for the White House.  I wouldn’t attempt to do that. 
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes of Fox Busine ss, ma’am.  And also, I’ll stay off of 
interest rates.  And first, I want to wish you happy holidays. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you. PETER BARNES.  And, second, I want to ask you about the Russian economy.  Did that 
come up in the meeting in your discussion a bout the global economic developments?  As you 
know, there’s a lot of con cern that with the drop in oil pric es, the Russian economy could be in 
some trouble.  Russia owes a lot of money to U.S.  and foreign banks and Russian companies.  Is 
there any concern about default?  Any concern about possible contag ion?  And, if so, has the Fed 
taken any steps to prepare for that?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we certainly did review global economic developments, 
including developments in the Russian economy.  Clearly, Russia has been hit very hard by the 
decline in oil prices, and the ru ble has depreciated enormously in  value, and this is posing a 
series of very difficult economic conditions in the Russian economy. 
Of course we discussed what the potential spi llovers are to the United States, which could 
occur both through trade and financia l linkages.  But these linkages ar e actually relatively small.  
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 20 of 23  Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. trade volume, and U.S. banks’ exposure to 
Russian residents is really quite small in terms of—relative to their capit al.  In terms of the 
portfolios of U.S. residents, there are Russian securities, but th ey are—they account for a very 
small share.  So I expect that the linkages back  to the spillovers to the United States, both 
through trade and financial channels, would be sm all.  Europe, of course, is somewhat more 
exposed to Russia, both because Russia is an impor tant supplier of oil and natural gas to Europe 
and the financial linkages are somewhat greater.  But, in the case of the United States, I see the 
spillovers relative—it is pret ty small.  But we’re obviously watching that closely. 
GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from Ma rketWatch.  Also, happy holidays. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Same to you. GREG ROBB.  There’s a contag ion risk to the—from low oil prices that people are 
talking about in the markets.  What does it mean  to the banks that have lent, you know, into the 
oil patch with the low oil prices?  And I guess, you know, your warnings about leveraged 
loans—you have made warnings over the past y ear about leveraged lending.  Are you worried 
that they haven’t be en heeded?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I mean, there is some—you ’re talking about in the United States 
exposure?  I mean, we have seen some impacts of lower oil prices on the spreads for high-yield 
bonds, where there’s exposure to oil companies that may see distress or  a decline in their 
earnings, and we have seen some increase in spr eads on high-yield bonds more generally.  I think 
for the banking system, as a whole, the exposure to oil—I’m not aware of significant issues 
there.  This is the kind of thing that is part of risk management for banking organizations and the 
kind of thing they look at in stre ss tests.  But the movements in oil prices have been very large 
and undoubtedly unexpected.  
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 21 of 23  We—in terms of leverage, and whether or not levered entities could be badly affected by 
movements in oil prices, leverage in the financ ial system, in general, is way down from the 
levels before the crisis.  So it’s not a major con cern that there are levere d entities that would be 
badly affected by this, but we’ll have to watch carefully.  There have be en large and unexpected 
movements in oil prices. 
STEVE BECKNER.  Good after noon, Chair Yellen.  Steve Beckner of MNI.  I will go 
back to interest rates, if you don’t mind.  Actual ly, it’s a question about balance sheet effects on 
the overall appropriate le vel of monetary policy.  In reaffirming the reinvestment policy, the 
FOMC says, once again, that this will help maintain accommodative financial conditions.  In the 
past, it’s said that the large portfolio of securities will exer t a downward effect on long-term 
interest rates.  As you look forward to raising sh ort-term rates, to what extent does the FOMC 
need to take into account this sort of resi dual, accommodative effect of maintaining a large 
balance sheet? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I agree, and that’s why we  stated that we typically think of the 
monetary policy impact of our a sset purchases as depending on the stock of assets that we hold 
on our balance sheet rather than the flow of purchases, and so we ’re reminding the public that we 
continue to hold a large stock of assets, and that is tending to push down term premiums in 
longer-term yields.  We made clear when we—or  tried to make clear—when we issued our 
normalization principles in September that we inte nd to use changes in our target for the federal 
funds rate as the main tool that we will actively use to adjust financial conditions.  Rather than 
actively planning to sell the assets that we’v e put onto our balance sheet, sometime after we 
begin raising our targets for s hort-term interest rates, depending on economic and financial 
conditions, we’re likely to reduc e or cease reinvestment and gra dually run down the stock of our 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 22 of 23  assets.  But our active tool for adjusting monetary —the stance of monetary  policy so that it is 
appropriate for the economic needs for the countr y, that will be done through adjusting our short-
term target range for the federal funds rate. 
KEVIN HALL.  Kevin Hall with McClatc hy Newspapers.  I can’t believe nobody’s 
asked you the most important question, about what ’s going on with your San Francisco 49ers, 
since everybody’s already wi shed you a happy holiday.  
Can you talk a little bit about housing?  Few things are more  important to Americans in 
their wealth creation than housing.  You’ve, in your statement, not ed that it continues to be a 
drag.  Mr. Dudley has—was actually  relatively upbeat in his foreca st.  I don’t know if that’s a 
view shared on the Committee.  What do you thi nk is holding housing back?  What can Congress 
do?  What will you tell Congress in the coming year?  And more—and a clarification on the 
Dudley question from earlier.  You didn’t mentio n him by name in your being pleased by quality 
of supervision.  Are you pleased with Mr. Dudley’s handling of the events? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with that .  I have great conf idence in President 
Dudley.  He’s done a fine job in  running the New York Fed, and I want to be very clear that I 
have great confidence in him.  He’s a distinguished public serv ant, and he has worked very hard 
in the aftermath of the crisis to make sure that  the New York Fed is doing  all that it needs to do 
to contribute to the work that we do both in fina ncial stability and in supe rvision.  And let’s see, 
the other question that you asked was about— 
KEVIN HALL.  Housing. CHAIR YELLEN.  —about housing.  So, you know , I’ve been surprised that housing 
hasn’t recovered more robustly than it has.  In part, I think it refl ects very tight credit—
continuing tight credit conditions for any borrower that doesn’t ha ve really pristine credit, you 
December 17, 2014 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 23 of 23  know, credit ratings, and my hope is that that situation will ease over time.  In addition, 
household formation has been very depressed, and my expectation is that , as the labor market 
continues to improve and households feel better about their financial condition, that we will see 
household formation pick up and a somewhat str onger recovery than we’ve seen thus far in 
housing.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen’s FOMC Press Conference 
March 18, 2015 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  A s you know, the Federal Open M arket Committee 
this afternoon reaffirmed the c urrent 0 to ¼ percent target ran ge for the federal funds rate.  We 
also updated our forward guidance,  indicating that an increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate remains unlikely at  our next meeting in April.  With  continued improvement in 
economic conditions, however, we do not want to rule out the po ssibility that an increase in the 
target range could be warranted a t subsequent meetings.  Let me  emphasize, however, that the 
timing of the initial increase in  the target range will depend on the Committee’s assessment of 
incoming information.  Today’s modification of our guidance sho uld not be interpreted to mean 
that we have decided on the timi ng of that increase.  In other words, just because we removed the 
word “patient” from the statem ent doesn’t mean we are going to be impatient.  Moreover, even 
after the initial increase in t he target funds rate, our policy  is likely to remain highly 
accommodative to support continued progress toward our objectiv es of maximum employment 
and 2 percent inflation.  I’ll co me back to today’s policy deci sions in a few moments, but first I 
would like to review economic de velopments and the outlook, whi ch formed the basis for our 
policy decisions. 
We have seen continued progress toward our objective of maximum  employment.  The 
pace of employment growth has remained strong, with job gains a veraging nearly 290,000 per 
month over the past three months.  The unemployment rate was 5. 5 percent in February; that’s 
three-tenths lower than the late st reading available at the tim e of our December meeting.  
Broader measures of job market conditions—such as those countin g individuals who want and 
are available to work but have not actively searched recently a nd people who are working part 
time but would rather work full time—have shown similar improve ment.  As we noted in our 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 2 of 22 
 statement, slack in the labor market continues to diminish.  Me anwhile, the labor force 
participation rate—the percenta ge of working-age Americans eith er working or seeking work—
is lower than most estimates of  its trend, and wage growth rema ins sluggish, suggesting that 
some cyclical weakness persists .  So considerable progress clea rly has been achieved, but room 
for further improvement in the  labor market continues. 
We continue to expect sufficien t underlying strength in economi c growth to support 
ongoing improvement in the labor m arket.  After averaging about  2½ percent over 2014, growth 
of real gross domestic product a ppears to have slowed in the fi rst quarter of this year, in part 
reflecting a moderation in hous ehold spending.  In addition, th e recovery in the housing sector 
remains subdued, and export growth looks to have weakened.  Loo king ahead, however, the 
Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of GDP growth, wi th robust job gains and lower 
energy prices supporting household spending. 
Inflation has declined further  below our longer-run objective, largely reflecting the lower 
energy prices I just mentioned.  D eclining import prices have a lso restrained inflation, and in 
light of the recent appreciation of  the dollar, will likely con tinue to do so in the months ahead.  
My colleagues and I continue to e xpect that as the effects of t hese transitory factors dissipate and 
as the labor market improves fu rther, inflation will move gradu ally back toward our 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  In making this forecast, we ar e attentive to the low levels of 
market-based measures of inflation compensation.  In contrast, survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations have r emained stable.  The Committe e will continue to monitor 
inflation developments carefully. 
This assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual e conomic projections 
submitted for this meeting by the FOMC participants.  As always , each participant’s projections 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 3 of 22 
 are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.  The unemployment rate 
projections over the next few y ears and in the longer run are g enerally a bit lower than the 
December projections.  At the end of this year, the central ten dency for the unemployment rate 
stands at 5 to 5.2 percent, in line with participants’ estimate s of the longer-run normal 
unemployment rate.  Committee participants generally see the un employment rate declining a 
little further ove r the course of 2016 and 2017.  For economic growth, participan ts generally 
reduced their projections since December, with many citing a we aker outlook for net exports.  
Nonetheless, the central tende ncy of the growth projections for  this year and next, at 2.3 to 2.7 
percent, remains somewhat above  estimates of the longer-run nor mal growth rate.  Finally, 
FOMC participants project infla tion to be quite low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and 
import prices.  The central ten dency of the inflation projectio ns for this year is now below 1 
percent, down noticeably since Dec ember.  As the transitory fac tors holding down inflation 
abate, the central tendenc y rebounds to 1.7 to 1.9 percent next  year and rises to 1.9 to 2 percent 
in 2017. 
Returning to monetar y policy, as I noted at the outset, the Com mittee reaffirmed its view 
that the current 0 to ¼ percent targ et range for the federal fu nds rate remains appropriate.  But 
with economic conditions improving, and with further improvemen t expected in the months 
ahead, we have again modified our  forward guidance.  In Decembe r and January, the Committee 
judged that it could be patient  in beginning to normalize the s tance of monetary policy.  That 
meant that we considered it unlikely that economic conditions w ould warrant an increase in the 
target range for the federal f unds rate for at least the next c ouple of FOMC meeti ngs.  While it is 
still the case that we consider  it unlikely that economic condi tions will warrant an increase in the 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 4 of 22 
 target range at the April meeting, such an increase could be wa rranted at any later meeting, 
depending on how the economy evolves. 
Let me emphasize again that toda y’s modification of the forward  guidance should not be 
read as indicating that the Com mittee has decided on the timing  of the initial increase in the 
target range for the federal f unds rate.  In particular, this c hange does not mean that an increase 
will necessarily occu r in June, although we can’t rule that out .  As we noted in our statement, the 
decision to raise the target range will depend on our assessmen t of realized and expected 
progress toward our objectives of  maximum employment and 2 perc ent inflation.  We continue 
to base that assessment on a wid e range of information, includi ng measures of labor market 
conditions, indicators of inflati on pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
and international developments.  W e anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise  the target range 
for the federal funds rate when the Committee has seen further improvement in the labor market 
and is reasonably confident that  inflation will move back to it s 2 percent objective over the 
medium term. 
Once we begin to remove policy acc ommodation, we continue to ex pect that—in the 
words of our statement—“even after employment and inflation are  near mandate-consistent 
levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping  the target federal funds rate 
below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.” 
This guidance is consistent with t he paths for appropriate poli cy reported by FOMC 
participants.  Compared with the  projections made in December, most participants lowered their 
path for the federal funds rat e, consistent with the downward r evisions made to the projections 
for GDP growth and inflation as well  as somewhat lower estimate s of the longer-run normal 
unemployment rate.  The median pr ojection for the federal funds  rate is just below 2 percent in 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 5 of 22 
 late 2016 and rises a bit above 3 pe rcent in late 2017.  The me dian projected rate in 2017 remains 
below the 3¾ percent or so projec ted by most participants as th e rate’s longer-run value, even 
though the central tendency of the unemployment rate by that ti me is slightly below that of its 
estimated longer-run value, and the  central tendency for inflat ion is close to our 2 percent 
objective.  Participants provide  a number of explanations for t he federal funds rate running 
below its normal longer-run level a t that time.  These include,  in particular, the residual effects of 
the financial crisis, which are  likely to continue to constrain  spending and credit availability for 
some time.  I would like to emphasize that these forecasts of t he appropriate path of the federal 
funds rate are conditional on par ticipants’ individual projecti ons for economic output, inflation, 
and other factors.  But our actua l policy actions over time wil l be data dependent.  Accordingly, 
if the expansion proves to be mor e vigorous than currently anti cipated and inflation moves 
higher than expected, then the a ppropriate path would likely fo llow a steeper and higher 
trajectory; conversely, if conditi ons were to prove weaker, the n the appropriate  trajectory would 
be lower and less steep. 
Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities a nd principal payments from agency debt and  mortgage-backed securities.  
The Committee’s sizable holdings  of longer-term securities shou ld help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions and promot e further progress toward our ob jectives.  
Thank you.  Now I’d be happy to take your questions. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reute rs.  Hi, thank you.  So there’s 
been this pretty consistent ref erence to expectations of above- trend growth over the last few 
months.  Now we’re seeing growt h downgraded in the context of v ery explicit references to 
international and external c onditions:  weak export growth, oil  dragging down inflation, and your 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 6 of 22 
 own comments now on the dollar.  S o my question is, doesn’t thi s indicate that the Fed’s facing a 
tougher time—you know, kind of going it alone, decoupling from the rest of the world—than 
perhaps you expected last fall wh en this first started to be an  issue? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, it looks like, from incoming data pertaini ng to the first quarter, 
that real GDP growth has decline d somewhat below where it was f or the last several quarters of 
last year.  And that’s really why t he Committee indicated that growth has moderated somewhat.  
There has been a slight downgrad ing of estimates of growth for this year.  You mentioned the 
dollar.  We noted that export gr owth has weakened.  Probably th e strong dollar is one reason for 
that. 
On the other hand, the strength of  the dollar also, in part, re flects the strength of the U.S. 
economy.  The strength of the dolla r is also one factor that, a s I noted, is holding down import 
prices and, at least on a transit ory basis at this point, pushi ng inflation down.  So, we are taking 
account of international developm ents, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in 
making the forecast we have here. 
Nevertheless, it is important t o recognize that this is not a w eak forecast.  Taking 
everything into account, we continue to project above-trend gro wth.  We continue to project 
improvement in the labor market by the end of 2015.  The centra l tendency of the participants is, 
they’re looking for an unemploym ent rate that will be down to 5 .0 to 5.2, which is consistent 
with their estimates of its l onger-run normal value.  So, we do  see considerable underlying 
strength in the U.S. econom y.  And, in spite of what looks like  a weaker first quarter, we are 
projecting good performance for the economy. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Cruts inger, Associated Press.  The po licy statement 
today talks about one of the prere quisites you’ll need to start  raising rates is to be “reasonably 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 7 of 22 
 confident” that inflation—your i nflation target—will be met at 2 percent, but that is coming out 
at a time when you’ve lowere d your forecast on inflation, what— which I would think would 
make you less confident about it .  What is it go ing to take to make you “reasonably confident” 
about inflation? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I don’t have a  mechanical answer for you.  T here is no single 
thing where I’d say, “We must s ee such-and-such  in order to ach ieve that level of confidence.”  
We will be looking at a wi de array of data. 
Now, we’ve said that we also wan t to see continued improvement in the labor market.  
And a stronger labor market wit h less labor market slack is one  factor that would tend to, 
certainly for me, increase my con fidence that as slack diminish es, that inflation will move up 
over time.  Other things I will be looking at—of course, the in flation data, but as we said, we 
expect inflation to remain quite low because of the depressing influence of energy price declines 
and the dollar.  But we will be looking at the inflation data c arefully to see if w e can interpret, for 
example, low levels of inflati on—if we see that, which we expec t, as reflecting those influences.  
We will be looking at wage growth.  We have not seen wage growt h pick up.  We may 
not see wage growth pick up, I woul dn’t say either that that is  a precondition to raising rates.  
But if we did see wage growth pi ck up, that would be at least a  symptom that inflation would 
likely move up over time. 
We’ll be watching inflation expe ctations.  Survey measures have  been stable; I expect 
that to continue, but we will be  watching it carefully.  And ma rket-based measures of inflation 
compensation have fallen.  They’re low.  If they were to move u p over time, that would probably 
serve to increase my confidence. 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 8 of 22 
 But there are a wide range of t hings that we will be looking at , including further 
improvement in the labor market .  So there’s no simple answer.  This is a judgment that the 
Committee will have to make. 
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon H ilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, the 
famous dot plot that we always ta lk about showed that officials ’ expectations for where interest 
rates are going to end the y ear in 2015, ’16, and ’17 have come  down fairly notably.  I wonder if 
you could explain to us your analy sis of why those estimates ar e coming down.  And, 
specifically, is it a reflecti on of—what’s changed?  And is it a reflection of the changes in the 
Fed’s economic forecast or a cha nge in the way the Fed is react ing to the economy that it sees—
its reaction function? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, it’s always  hard to know exactly why each pa rticipant has written 
down the forecast they have, but certainly there are changes in  the assessments of the economy 
and forecasts for the economy tha t would point in the direction  of downward adjustment in the 
funds rate path.  For one thi ng, you do see meaningful downward  adjustment in the inflation 
forecast, certainly for this year. 
In addition, importantly, a numbe r of participants have marked down their estimates of 
the normal longer-run unemploymen t rate.  So that range has mov ed down noticeably from—
previously it was 5.2 to 5.5, and i t’s now moved down to 5.0 to  5.2.  And downward revisions to 
the longer-run normal unemployment rate in a way suggests that participants are seeing more 
slack in the economy now than the y previously did.  So I think both of those things would point 
to downward revision in the funds rate path. 
SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  The experience of some 
other central banks—notably Japa n, Sweden also—suggests that ti ghtening earl y when you’re at 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 9 of 22 
 the zero lower bound can be a risky process—the ri sks of tighte ning early can dramatically 
outweigh the risks of leaving thi ngs a little l onger.  I wonder  if you could comment on that 
international experience and expl ain how that’s influencing the  debate in the FOMC at the 
moment. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, when an econom y is operating at the so-cal led zero lower 
bound, there—it creates a situation w here there are asymmetric risks.  It is possible, if the 
economy proves stronger than is  expected, to r espond to that by  tightening policy.  If there are 
adverse shocks to demand that tend to push infla tion and econom ic performance in an adverse 
direction, it’s not possible to l ower rates.  Of course, that’s  a reason why, for a number of years, 
we engaged in active asset purch ase programs.  So there is a si tuation there of asymmetric risks, 
and it does point in the direct ion of waiting longer to raise r ates. 
But I would say that this is a n influence that we—and a set of considerations—that we 
have long been aware of and have been taking into account, so t hat it’s not some thing that just 
comes into play now.  It is a reas on that we have held our rate s at 0 to ¼ percent for, now, 
roughly six years.  So, we are see ing an economy that’s growing  above trend, the labor market is 
improving.  I think some of the h eadwinds that have long been h olding the economy back are 
beginning to recede, which is a reason that the Committee wants  to be able to evaluate incoming 
data and consider when it may be  appropriate to finally raise r ates.  But that is a consideration we 
have long taken into account. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesma n, CNBC.  I don’t hear, Chair Yelle n, any quantitative 
measures of what increasing conf idence is in inflation or headi ng back towards—or a further 
improvement in the job market, which is unusual for a Fed that not too long ago was providing 
us metrics on unemployment about when it would move with rates.   Is it now policy to keep the 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 10 of 22 
 market guessing?  And is it thoug ht that you’d have better poli cy and economic outcomes from 
less certainty about the path of  interest rates?  And a kind of  related question, if you will:  Could 
you see raising rates while the C ommittee still judges that the  risks are balanced?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, in terms of cer tainty and providing metrics,  we provided a metric 
or a threshold of 6½ percent severa l years ago and told market participants and the public that we 
wouldn’t consider it appropriate  to raise rates as long as the unemployment rate was higher than 
that level, as long as inflati on was well contained.  But our p olicy needs to be data dependent, 
and we need to respond to incom ing data and our assessment of i ncoming data in terms of where 
we think the economy is heading a nd how close we are to our obj ectives. 
And the markets—so, can we provide  certainty?  Of course we can ’t provide certainty 
because we’re not certain what th e data will look like and how the economy will evolve.  And to 
achieve our objectives, we need t o watch the data, continually reformulate our best guesses—our 
forecasts of where the econo my is going—and respond appropriate ly.  And we can’t provide 
certainty and shouldn’t provide c ertainty because economic deve lopments that will unfold are 
uncertain.  And what market par ticipants should be doing is loo king at incoming data just as we 
are and forming their expectati ons for where policy will be goi ng and should be going just 
exactly as we will be doing by a ttempting to understand economi c developments as they unfold.  
And that’s—that is what we’re t rying to say in this statement, that that’s what we will be doing 
going forward.  And we don’t want  to—and don’t think it’s appro priate at this point—to provide 
calendar-based guidance. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Can I have the  second part about the balance of  risks—would you 
raise rates when risks are balanced? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  The risks to what? 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 11 of 22 
 STEVE LIESMAN.  If risks are ba lanced, as they say in the state ment, could you be 
raising rates in that context? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I guess we s aid the risks to the outlook a re balanced.  And, I 
mean, certainly we could raise r ates in a situati on where the r isks are balanced.  We need to see, 
as we have said, we want to see fu rther improvement in the labo r market, and we want to feel 
reasonably confident that the economy is on a trajectory where we will achieve our 2 percent 
inflation objective. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  There seems to be an 
awful lot riding on surveys of i nflation expectations, yet thos e surveys are an imprecise 
instrument; they don’t seem partic ularly sensiti ve to the types  of changes in inflation that we 
have seen in recent years, they don’t seem to differentiate bet ween, say, 1.5 and 2—the 
expectations remain stable ev en through those changes.  Could y ou talk a little bit about why the 
FOMC has confidence that those me asures are accurate reflection s of where inflation is likely to 
go and whether, you know, the concerns  that you’ve articulated about market-based measures at 
all correspond to concerns that  you may have about survey-based  measures? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, survey-base d measures aren’t perfect.  And  the mean—often 
the mean or even the median of those measures does not line up very well with actual inflation, 
so they seem to be biased.  Nev ertheless, they do seem to be us eful in predicting actual 
movements in inflation.  And because we think inflation expecta tions are a determinant of price 
setting, we need to be looking at the best data that we can, ev en if it’s imperfect, in trying to 
gauge inflation expectations.  And so we do look at survey meas ures. 
Now, the fact that survey measur es are stable, even if they are  stable at levels consistent 
with inflation objectives that a central bank wants to achieve,  that’s not a guarantee that inflation 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 12 of 22 
 will, over time, move to be consis tent with those expectations.   An example is Japan, I would 
give you, where for many years th e households and businesses ex pected positive inflation but 
there was a consistent undershoot .  So, this isn’t a single met ric that is perf ect, but it’s one of 
many things we’d look at. 
We also look at measures of inf lation expectations based on mar ket differentials between 
nominal and real or TIPS yields .  They’re also informative but can move around for reasons 
pertaining to liquidity in the Tr easury market and in the TIPS market, and also because of 
changing perceptions of inflati on risk.  So, they’re not a pure  read, either.  And we want to look 
at both things and not take aw ay any simple morals. 
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fo x Business.  Chair Yellen, I wan ted to check in again 
with you on whether or not you see or  have any concerns about b ubbles out there in the 
economy, particularly the financi al markets—debt and equity mar kets.  And I wanted to refer to 
your most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress last month, in which you said “overall 
equity valuations by some conventional measures are somewhat hi gher than their historical 
levels . . . valuation metrics in some sectors continued to app ear stretched rela tive to historical 
norms.”  In the same report last  year, in July, the report spec ifically mentioned biotech and social 
media stocks as being “substantia lly”—let me see here—“substant ially stretched.”  Do you still 
feel that way and can you co mment on bubbles and particularly t hese sectors? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I don’t want  to comment on those particula r sectors.  You 
know, as we said in the report, overall measures of equity valu ations are on the high side but not 
outside of historical ranges.  In s ome corporate debt markets, we do see evidence of unusually 
low spreads, and that’s what was  referred to i n the report. 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 13 of 22 
 More broadly, we do try to assess pot ential threats to financia l stability.  And in addition 
to looking at asset valuations, w e also look at measures of cre dit growth, of the extent of 
leverage being used in the econom y and in the financial sector,  and the extent of maturity 
transformation.  And taking into account a broad range of metri cs that bear on financial stability, 
our overall assessment at this poi nt is that threats are modera te. 
JENNIFER LIBERTO.  Jen Liberto, Politico .  So, I want to switch ge ars a little bit and 
ask about some of the tension be tween the Fed and Congress late ly, with some lawmakers calling 
for more transparency and acc ountability measures.  And I wante d to ask to what degree that 
there might be room for the Fed to consider some of these measu res, like maybe a rules-based 
approach like the Taylor rule, or  some of these measures that w ould change up who has a voting 
seat on the FOMC.  To what degree does that make it more diffic ult to accomplish your mission? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I believe the Federal Reserve is already one  of the most 
transparent central  banks of any around the  globe.  We provide an immense amount of 
information, both financial—about  our balance sheet—and our mon etary policy operations.  We 
have audited financial statem ents.  We publish our balance shee t every week.  If you want to 
know exactly what’s in the SOM A portfolio, it’s listed on the N ew York Fed website on a 
CUSIP-by-CUSIP basis.  I have pre ss conferences.  We issue minu tes.  We have, you know, 
statements that we release right  after meetings and transcripts  within five years.  So, if you put 
all that together, we are a transparent central bank. 
With respect to congressional cha nges that are under considerat ion that would politicize 
monetary policy by bring ing Congress in to make policy judgment s about, in real-time, on our 
monetary policy decisions.  C ongress itself decided in 1978 tha t that was a bad t hing to do, that it 
would lead to poor economic perfor mance, and they carved out th is one area of policy reviews, 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 14 of 22 
 of monetary policy decisionmaking, from GAO audits.  The GAO lo oks at everything else that 
goes on within the Fed.  And I thi nk that that is a central ban k best practice.  
The global experience shows th at giving central banks independe nce to make monetary 
policy decisions that th ey think are in the be st interest of th e country and consistent with their 
mandates leads to lower inflation and more stable macroeconomic  outcomes.  So, I feel very 
strongly about that, but we are accountable to Congress.  Of co urse, we’re ready to provide 
information that Congress needs t o evaluate the Fed’s decisionm aking, in monetary policy and 
elsewhere. 
With respect to monetary policy rules, they can be useful, and I find them useful—and 
long have—as a kind of benchmark f or thinking about what might be the appropriate stance of 
policy.  But to chain a central ba nk to follow a simple mathema tical rule that fai ls to take account 
of many things that are very im portant in making monetary polic y—for example, I was earlier 
asked about being against the z ero lower bound, which is an imp ortant special consideration—
that would be a very foolis h thing to do, and I oppose it. 
With respect to proposals havi ng to do with voting and the stru cture of the Fed that you 
mentioned, a lot of ideas have  been mentioned.  I would say, fo r my part, I think the Federal 
Reserve works well.  The syste m we have was put into place by C ongress decades ago.  I don’t 
think it’s a system that’s br oken.  Of course, Congress can rev isit the decisions it’s made about 
the structure of the Fed.  The re were good reasons for making t he decisions that were made about 
how to structure voting and other things, but—and I don’t think  the system is broken, I think it’s 
working well.  So I don’t see a need for changes.  But, of cour se, it’s up to Congress to review 
that. 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL

 STEVEN MUFSON.  I was wondering w hether you could quantify the effect that the 
stronger dollar has had on econom ic output so far this year; th e extent to which it’s sort of acted 
as its own rate increase; and w hat sort of obligation you feel,  if any, to make life easier for the 
ECB, Bank of Japan, and the many emerging market countries that  are struggling with some of 
the issues we struggle d with not that long ago. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, with respect t o the impact of the dollar on the U.S. economy, I 
don’t have a quantitative estimat e to offer you, but I certainl y expect net exports to serve as a 
notable drag, this year, on the  outlook.  But, remember, we hav e to put that in context:  There are 
a lot of things that affect t he U.S. outlook, and while that is  serving as a drag on economic 
growth, overall the Committee continues to see sufficient stren gth—particularly in private 
spending—that we are expecti ng above-trend growth, even so. 
With respect to our neighbors, we look very carefully at what’s  happening in the global 
environment.  We realize that ou r own policies affect performan ce in the rest of the world, and 
that performance in other count ries has an influence on us, so we spend a good deal of time 
discussing global developments .  It is important for us to keep  our own house in order, to put in 
place the policy that’s consistent with the objectives that Con gress has given us, and I think a 
strong U.S. economy certainly i s something that is good for oth er countries as well.  We have 
pledged to communicate as clearly  as we can about monetary poli cy, and I am trying to do that, 
and will continue to do so. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.   We 
talked about the risk of tighten ing too early.  What about the risk of waiting too long, especially 
since it can take a while for Fe d actions to work their way thr ough the economy? 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 16 of 22 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I agree with that.  Many, many studies over decades and 
decades have showed that there are lags in the way monetary pol icy affects the economy, and, 
therefore, monetary policy does  have to be forward looking.  Th at’s why we spend so much time 
preparing forecasts and discussi ng them, and we want to put in place a policy that will be 
appropriate for where the econom y is heading.  That’s—that is, you know, a reason that many of 
my colleagues—most of my colleag ues—are anticipating that it wi ll be appropriate to begin to 
tighten policy sometime this year .  In spite of the fact that t hey are projecting tha t inflation will 
be low, they’re looking forwar d and they see that, by the end o f 2016 or 2017, with the labor 
market recovering, and assuming tha t inflation expectations rem ain stable and transitory 
influences no longer affecting inflation, they see inflation he ading back to our 2 percent 
objective.  So just as we don’t wa nt to be premature in tighten ing policy and aborting a recovery 
that we have worked long and hard to proceed as far as it has, we also don’t want to be behind 
the curve in beginning to  tighten given those lags. 
CRAIG TORRES.  Madame Chair, I’d like to preface this by saying , I do believe you 
stand for accountability.  And—so, recently, a bunch of us, we’ re in a room over there, there was 
a police guard outside, and your sta ff had taken our cell phone s, and they controlle d the Internet 
in the room—all this to guard the  security of the FOMC statemen t.  If one of us had leaked it, we 
would lose our jobs.  Surely the re would be a prosecution, and my friends here in the press 
would certainly have a ba nner day with that story. 
There was a leak in the FOMC .  We don’t know what happened.  I’ ve asked, I can’t get 
an answer.  And now Congress is  asking.  Both par ties want to k now.  I’m not going to ask about 
the IG’s probe—I understand that’ s an active case now, suddenly , after two years of just sitting 
there.  But I would like to as k what you’ve found at the Board.   You weren’t Chairman then, you 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 17 of 22 
 were Vice Chair, I believe.  S o what answers do you have, and a re you going to respond to 
Congress? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, let me say tha t the Committee and I, persona lly, take very 
seriously our responsibility to s afeguard confidential informat ion.  We have a set of policies and 
procedures that are in place that  we’re to follow if we believe  that there have been leaks of 
confidential information.  And thi s is something that doesn’t o ccur very often, but if it does 
occur, we follow those procedures.  It has been reported that o ur Inspector General is engaged in 
a review at this time of thi s matter, and in light of that ongo ing review, I’m not going to get into 
details, but let me just say tha t we welcome that review and ar e looking forward to its 
conclusions.  With respect to C ongress, congressional inquiries —we have arranged to brief 
members of Congress who’ve ask ed about this, and we’ll certainl y cooperate in trying to provide 
them the information that they seek. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Madame Chair, thanks for taking my question.  Th e banking sector 
has clearly improved since the cr isis in terms of capital reten tion, but there’s also seemingly a 
number of scandals involving for ex manipulation, of course LIBO R.  Do you think that the 
culture at the banks is wher e it ought to be?  And, if not, wha t is the Fed going to do to improve 
it, and when? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, it’s certai nly been—I mean, it’s certainly  been very 
disappointing to see what have been some really brazen violatio ns of the law, and we absolutely 
expect the banks that we superv ise to comply with the law and t o have in place controls that 
ensure compliance in organiza tions.  And while changing the cul ture of organizations is not 
something that we can achieve through supervision, we will make  sure that the banks that we 
supervise have appropriate comp liance regimes in place.  And to  the extent that compensation 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 18 of 22 
 schemes might be incenting such b ehavior that inappropriately r ewards risk-taking, that’s 
something that was—we will, you know, look for in our supervisi on as well. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  I have a follow-up.  When you introduced—you int roduced a 
compensation rule in 2011.  Wh en do you think we might see some  movement on that—on that 
rule? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, the agencies— the agencies are working join tly to bring out a 
rule on this, but we do have supe rvisory policies in place conc erning the structure of incentive 
pay and compensation, and our superv ision covers that topic now .  And we have seen, I think, 
meaningful changes already in the  structure of compensation and  banking organizations to 
diminish ways in which it might incent risk-taking. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.  Pedro da Costa  with Dow Jones Newswires.  I gu ess I have two 
follow-ups, one with regard to Cra ig’s question.  So, before th e IG’s investigation, according to 
Republican Congressman Hensarlin g’s letter to your office, he s ays that, “It is my understanding 
that although the Federal Reserve ’s General Counsel was initial ly involved in this investigation, 
the inquiry was dropped at the r equest of several members of th e FOMC.”  Now, that predates 
the IG.  I want to know if you coul d tell us who are these memb ers of the FOMC who struck 
down this investigation?  And doe sn’t not revealing these facts  kind of go directly against the 
sort of transparency and account ability that you’re trying to b ring to the central bank? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  That is an allega tion that I don’t believe has a ny basis in fact.  I’m not 
going to go into the details, but I  don’t know where that piece  of information could possibly have 
come from. 
PEDRO DA COSTA.  If I could follow up on his question.  I think  when you get asked 
about financial crimes and t he public hears you talk about comp liance, you get a sense that 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 19 of 22 
 there’s not enough enforcement i nvolved in these actions, and t hat it’s merely a case of kind of 
trying to achieve settlements a fter the fact.  Is there a sense  in the regulatory community that 
financial crimes need to be punished  sort of more forcefully in  order for them to be—for there to 
be an actual deterrent agai nst unethical behavior? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, the—you’re tal king about within banking orga nizations?  So, the 
focus of regulators—the banki ng regulators—is safety and soundn ess, and what we want to see 
is changes made as rapidly as pos sible that will eliminate prac tices that are unsafe and unsound.  
We can’t—only the Justice Depart ment can bring criminal action,  and they have taken up cases 
where they think that that’s app ropriate.  In some situations, when we are able to identify 
individuals who were responsib le for misdeeds, we can put in pl ace prohibitions that bar them 
from participating in banking, a nd we have done so and will con tinue to do so. 
STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckner  of MNI.  Good afternoon, Madame C hair.  The 
FOMC said last September that it will wait ‘til after the first  rate hike to stop or to discontinue 
reinvesting proceeds of its MBS holdings and stop rolling over maturing Treasurie s.  What is the 
FOMC’s current thinking about  how long after liftoff you should  wait to stop reinvestments and 
rollovers?  And, given the very lar ge amounts of Treasuries mat uring next year, would it make 
sense for the FOMC to vary the pace of runoff that it allows? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, we issued in Se ptember a set of normalizatio n principles, and, as 
you noted, the Committee indicated t hat we will eventually ceas e reinvestments or diminish the 
pace of reinvestments as a way of  gradually reducing the size o f our portfolio over time.  We 
said we would do that when econom ic conditions were appropriate  after we begin raising rates, 
because we want changes in the—our target range for the federal  funds rate to be the main tool 
by which we shift the stance of monetary policy.  We’ve not made any deci sion at this point 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 20 of 22 
 about how long it will be, once we b egin to raise rates, before  we reduce or cease reinvestment.  
We will see how things go, and the Committee will revisit that and make a decision at a later 
time.  
You also indicated that we have  a substantial quantity of Treas uries that will roll off our 
balance sheet over the next sev eral years.  That’s true, and th at will—I think, over the next two 
years, almost $800 billion will matu re—and that they will be sh ort-term, obviously, Treasuries at 
that point, and that’s a way in whi ch we anticipate diminishing  the size of our portfolio. 
STEVE BECKNER.  Can I follow  up, please?  Some people have sugg ested that you 
might need to manage those runoffs  a little more granularly, if  that’s a word, perhaps pursue a 
different track for Treasur ies versus MBS or, you know, at give n quarters when you have very 
large amounts maturing, and there  might be a spike in long-term  interest rates, that maybe you 
would vary the rate of runoff.  I s that—any consideration given  to that? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s something for which we’ve made no plans, and I don’t really 
have anything for you on that. 
GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from Mark etWatch.  We hear that productiv ity takes a long 
time before you can understand it, b ut it’s been very low in th is cycle.  What does that mean for 
Fed policy? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I agree, it has been very low—it’s been di sappointingly low.  A 
positive aspect of what is fundamentally a disappointment is th at the labor market has improved 
more rapidly than might have been expected given the pace of ec onomic growth.  So the 
unemployment rate has come down m ore rapidly than I would have expected, and the labor 
market has improved more rapidly than I would have expected.  W e have written down our 
estimates of potential output .  In the long run, it is a disapp ointing factor about the ultimate 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 21 of 22 
 prospects for the U.S. econom y if it continues.  I would expect  it to pick up, and as you can see 
from the longer-run growth projections, most FOMC participants believe it will pick up above 
current levels.  But it means it’s something that would, if it persists, retard living standards and 
would likely retard real wage gr owth and improvement in living standards for ordinary 
households. 
PETER COOK.  Peter Cook of Bloombe rg Television.  Madame Chair,  one clarification, 
if I could, logistically, and t hen a question about Congress, a  follow-up.  First of all, you’ve been 
asked this before, I just want t o see if we can clarify.  When you decide to start raising interest 
rates, could that decision ha ppen at a meeting in which you—it’ s not followed by a press 
conference?  And, on my congressi onal question, I would like to  get your reaction to your—the 
treatment you received up on Capito l Hill the other day.  It di dn’t look like a very pleasant 
experience, certainly in front of  the House, at least at moment s.  I wondered if you have concerns 
about that.  Has the relations hip between the Fed and Congress deteriorated to a point that it 
causes you concern?  What, if anything, can you do about it as well? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start w ith the press conferences.  I s aid this previously, and 
let me reiterate it, that ever y meeting that the Federal Open M arket Committee has is a live 
meeting at which we could make a decision.  Clearly, if we deci ded for the first time to raise the 
federal funds rate, it is som ething—I think it would be appropr iate to answer questions and 
explain in more detail.  We ha ve long had the capacity to call a press conference after a meeting 
that we would hold by teleconfer ence—by conference call—and tha t’s a capacity that was used 
on a number of occasions by my predecessor during the financial  crisis.  It is something that 
remains a capacity we have and w ould expect to use if it were n ecessary. 
March 18, 2015 Chair Yellen’s P ress Conference FINAL 
 
Page 22 of 22 
 On the second part of your question , with respect to testimony,  you know, it’s very 
important for the Federal Reser ve to be accountable to Congress .  We have a wide range of 
responsibilities, and it’s entirely appropr iate for me to testi fy and be quizzed on a range of topics 
by members of Congress.  I—you know , I think I need to be ready  to answer questions on any 
aspect of Federal Reserve behavi or, and that’s an important pri nciple.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference 
June 17, 2015 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Toda y the Federal Open Market C ommittee 
reaffirmed the current 0 to ¼ perc ent target range for the fede ral funds rate.  Since the 
Committee last met in April, the  pace of job gains has picked u p and labor market conditions 
have improved somewhat further .  Inflation has c ontinued to run  below our longer-run objective, 
but some of the downward pressure  on inflation re sulting from e arlier sharp declines in energy 
prices is abating.  The Committee continues to judge that the f irst increase in the federal funds 
rate will be appropriate when it  has seen further improvement i n the labor market and is 
reasonably confident that infla tion will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the medium 
term.  At our meeting that ended today, the Committee concluded  that these conditions have not 
yet been achieved.  It remains th e case that the Committee will  determine the timing of the initial 
increase in the federal funds r ate on a meeting-by-meeting basi s, depending on its assessment of 
incoming economic information and its implications for the econ omic outlook.  Let me 
emphasize that the importance of  the initial increase should no t be overstated:  The stance of 
monetary policy will likely remain highly accommodative for qui te some time after the initial 
increase in the federal funds rat e in order to s upport continue d progress toward our objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  I will come back t o today’s policy decision in a 
few moments, but first I would lik e to review recent economic d evelopments and the outlook. 
The U.S. economy hit a soft patc h earlier this year; real gross  domestic product looks to 
have changed little in the fir st quarter.  Growth in household spending slowed, business fixed 
investment edged down, and net export s were a substantial drag on growth.  Part of this 
weakness was likely the result of  transitory factors.  Despite the soft first quarter, the 
fundamentals underlying househol d spending appear favorable, an d consumer sentiment remains 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 2 of 23 
 solid.  Looking ahead, the Committee still expects a moderate p ace of GDP growth, with 
continuing job gains and lower energy prices supporting househo ld spending. 
The labor market data so far this year have shown further progr ess toward our objective 
of maximum employment, although a t a slower pace than late last  year.  Over the past three 
months, job gains have averaged about 210,000 per month, down f rom an average pace of 
280,000 per month over the second hal f of last year, but still well above the pace consistent with 
trend labor force growth.  Alt hough the unemployment rate, at 5 .5 percent in May, was 
unchanged from the latest readi ng available at the time of our April meeting, the labor force 
participation rate edged up.  A broader measure of unemployment  that includes individuals who 
want and are available to wor k but have not actively searched r ecently and people who are 
working part time but would rather work full time has continued  to improve.  But it seems likely 
that some cyclical weakness in the labor market remains:  The p articipation rate remains below 
most estimates of its underlyi ng trend, involuntary part-time e mployment remains elevated, and 
wage growth remains relat ively subdued.  So, although progress clearly has been achieved, room 
for further improvement remains. 
Inflation has continued to r un below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower 
energy prices.  Declines in import  prices have also restrained inflation.  However, energy prices 
appear to have stabilized recen tly.  My colleagues and I contin ue to expect that as the effects of 
these transitory factors dissipa te and as the labor market impr oves further, inflation will 
gradually move back toward our 2 p ercent objective over the med ium term.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensa tion remain low, though they have  risen some from their levels 
earlier this year, and survey-ba sed measures of longer-term inf lation expectations have remained 
stable.  The Committee will continue to monitor inflation devel opments carefully. 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL

 This assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual e conomic projections 
submitted for this meeting by FOMC participants.  As always, ea ch participant’s projections are 
conditioned on his or her own view  of appropriate monetary poli cy.  For economic growth, 
participants reduced their proj ections for this year, in line w ith the disappointing data for the first 
quarter.  The central tendency of  the growth projections for 20 15 is now 1.8 to 2.0 percent, down 
a little more than ½ percentage po int from the March projection s.  The central tendency rises to 
2.4 to 2.7 percent next year, somewhat above estimates of the l onger-run growth rate.  The 
unemployment rate projections for  this year are a little higher  than in March.  At the end of this 
year, the central tendency for t he unemployment rate stands at 5.2 to 5.3 percent, a bit above 
participants’ estimates of the  longer-run normal unemployment r ate.  Committee participants 
generally see the unemployment ra te declining a little further over the course of 2016 and 2017.  
Finally, FOMC participants projec t inflation to be quite low th is year, largely reflecting lower 
energy and non-energy import prices .  The central tendency of t he inflation projections for this 
year is below 1 percent, unchanged since March.  As the transit ory factors holding down 
inflation abate, the central  tendency rises to 1.6 to 1.9 perce nt next year and to 1.9 to 2.0 percent 
in 2017. 
Returning to monetary policy, as I noted, the Committee reaffir med its view that the 
current 0 to ¼ percent target ra nge for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  As we said in 
our statement, the decision to rai se the target range will depe nd on our assessment of realized 
and expected progress toward our o bjectives of maximum employme nt and 2 percent inflation.  
We continue to base that assessm ent on a wide range of informat ion, including measures of labor 
market conditions, indicators of  inflation pressures and inflat ion expectations, and readings on 
financial and international de velopments.  And we continue to a nticipate that it will be 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 4 of 23 
 appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rat e when the Committee has seen 
further improvement in the labor  market and is reasonably confi dent that inflation will move 
back to its 2 percent objectiv e over the medium term. 
On both of these fronts, as I not ed, we have seen some progress .  Even so, the Committee 
judged that economic conditions do not yet warrant an increase in the federal funds rate.  While 
the Committee views the disappoi nting economic performance in t he first quarter as largely 
transitory, my colleagues and I  would like to see more decisive  evidence that a moderate pace of 
economic growth will be sustained, so that conditions in the la bor market will continue to 
improve and inflation will move back to 2 percent. 
Once we begin to remove policy acc ommodation, we continue to ex pect that—as we say 
in our statement—“even after emp loyment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, 
economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the tar get federal funds rate below 
levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”  In other words, alt hough policy will be 
data dependent, economic conditions  are currently anticipated t o evolve in a manner that will 
warrant only gradual increases in the target federal funds rate . 
Compared with the projections mad e in March, most FOMC particip ants lowered 
somewhat their paths for the fede ral funds rate, consistent wit h the revisions made to the 
projections for GDP growth and the  unemployment rate.  The medi an projection for the federal 
funds rate continues to point to a first increase later this ye ar, with the rate rising to about 
1¾ percent in late 2016 and 2¾ pe rcent in late 2017.  In 2016 a nd 2017, the median path is about 
¼ percentage point below that pr ojected in March.  The median p rojected rate in 2017 remains 
below the 3¾ percent or so projec ted by most FOMC participants as the longer-run value of the 
federal funds rate even though the  central tendency of the unem ployment rate by that time is 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 5 of 23 
 slightly below its estimated l onger-run value and the central t endency for inflati on is close to our 
2 percent objective.  Participant s provided a number of explana tions for the federal funds rate 
running below its normal longer-run l evel at that time.  These included, in particular, the residual 
effects of the financial crisis , which are likely to continue t o constrain spending and credit 
availability for some time. 
I would like to emphasize that the forecasts of the appropriate  path of the federal funds 
rate are conditional on participants’ individual projections of  the most likely outcomes for 
economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors.  But  our actual policy decisions over 
time will depend on evolving economic conditions.  Accordingly,  if the expansion proves to be 
more vigorous than currently an ticipated and inflation moves hi gher than expected, then the 
appropriate path would likely fo llow a steeper a nd higher traje ctory; conversely, if conditions 
were to prove weaker, then the a ppropriate tra jectory would be lower and less steep. 
Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities a nd principal payments from agency debt and  mortgage-backed securities.  
The Committee’s sizable holdings  of longer-term securities shou ld help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions and promot e further progress toward our ob jectives. 
Thank you.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.  YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan Mui from the Washington Post .  As you mentioned, almost all of 
the FOMC participants believe that the first rate hike will com e this year.  But two of your 
colleagues believe that 2016 is th e appropriate time, the IMF h as called on 2016 as the 
appropriate time for liftoff as well, and markets seems to plac e a greater probability of liftoff in 
January than they do in September.  So what are—what is the mis understanding here?  What 
is—what do they have wrong, and why do you think that waiting u ntil 2016 is a mistake? 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 6 of 23 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, there are  obviously a range of opinions, b oth in the market and 
among Committee members, at this time on what the appropriate s tance of policy is likely to be 
later this year and next year.  But , importantly, the—when the people write down their dots in the 
SEP, they’re making forecasts a bout what unfolding data is like ly to show.  But the participants 
will all be—their views will evolve with unfolding data. 
For all of us, the appropri ate policy decision is going to be d ata dependent, and all of us 
will be looking at incoming data .  And our opinions about the a ppropriate timing of 
normalization are likely to shi ft as we look at how the data ev olves.  Differences in the 
appropriate assessments of the appropriate stance of policy—in addition to reflecting different 
views on the outlook, there are a s et of risks that all of us n eed to weigh in judging on the—
judging the appropriate time of t he beginning of normalization.   On the one hand, waiting too 
long to begin normalization can r isk significan tly overshooting  our inflation objective given the 
lags in the operation of mone tary policy.  And, on the other ha nd, beginning too early could risk 
derailing a recovery that we ha ve worked for a very long time t o try to achieve.  And so we’re 
trying to assess those risks. 
But I want to emphasize, sometimes too much attention is placed  on the timing of the 
first increase in the federal  funds rate.  And what should matt er to market participants is the 
entire trajectory, the entire expected trajectory of policy.  A nd, again, while our actual policy 
decisions will have to evolve in  light of what really does happ en in the economy, the Committee, 
as you can see by the SEP projections , currently anticipates th at conditions will evolve in the 
economy in a manner that will make  it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate gradually over 
time.

 STEVE LIESMAN.  Madam Chair, I  wonder if you might characterize  the progress made 
towards fulfilling the Fed’s tw o criteria.  Are you somewhat mo re confident, not confident at all 
that you’re moving towards 2 percen t?  Has there been a lot of improvement in the labor market?  
Some improvement?  And how shoul d we judge when those two crite ria have been fulfilled? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, it’ s a judgment that the Committee is—will  have to make, and, 
as I’ve said previously and as we ’ve said in the statement, it will depend on a wide range of data 
and not on any simple indicators .  So I can’t provide you—it wo uld be wrong for me to provide 
you a roadmap that said something as simple as, if the unemploy ment rate declines to X, that 
then the labor market will ha ve improved enough for us to begin  to raise policy. 
Obviously, we have to look at the pace of job creation.  We hav e to look at what’s 
happening to labor force particip ation, to part-time employment  for economic reasons, to job 
openings, to the pace of quits, t o wage inflation, and other in dicators of the state of the labor 
market.  I did say when we agreed that labor market slack has d iminished to some extent in the 
intermeeting period, and, clearl y, over a longer span of time, over the last several years, 
obviously we’ve made considerab le progress in moving toward our  goal of maximum 
employment.  So, in spite of the f act that there is some progre ss on that front, the Committee 
wants to see some further progre ss before feeling that it will be appropriate to raise rates.  
On inflation, again, there has b een some progress, in the sense  energy prices appear to 
have stabilized.  Now, inflati on is going to—overall inflation is likely to run at a low level for a 
substantial period of time.  The  big declines in energy prices came toward the end of last year 
and the beginning of this year , and they’re not going to wash o ut of the inflation data until late in 
this year.  But the fact that en ergy prices have stabilized mea ns that the pressure from that source 
is diminishing. 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 8 of 23 
 In addition, the dollar appears to have largel y stabilized.  An d, with respect to core 
inflation, it has been runni ng under our 2 percent objective, b ut declining import prices have 
been reducing that pressure.  I be lieve that as the labor marke t continues to improve and as our 
confidence in that forecast rise s, at least for me, my confiden ce will also rise that inflation will 
move back up toward 2 percent.  I e xpect that to, over time, pu t upward pressure on core 
inflation.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Thank you, Chair Y ellen.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street 
Journal.   Two questions if I may.  First , I wanted to ask you about a c omment that New York 
Fed President William Dudley made recently that, in retrospect,  the Fed should have raised 
interest rates more aggre ssively during the 2004–2006 cycle.  T his was in a footnote to a speech 
he gave.  I wonder if you agree with  that and whether there are  any lessons from the 2004–2006 
cycle that should be applied t oday.  And, second, relating to C ongress, the Fed has resisted past 
efforts in Congress to pass measur es like an “Audit the Fed” bi ll or a measure to subject the Fed 
to a policy rule.  There’s now a Shelby bill out there.  I wond er if there’s anything in that that 
you can accept and, more broadl y, whether there’s anything you could point to that Congress can 
do to make the Fed a more effective institution and a more acco untable institution.  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay, so on the f irst question you asked about t he 2004–06 rate 
increase cycle.  Throughout that  period, the Fed indicated that  rates would rise at a measured 
pace, and that turned out to be, I believe, 17 meetings, with 2 5 basis point increases at each 
meeting.  As I’ve emphasized, previously, we have—absolutely do  not expect to follow any 
mechanical 25 basis points a meeting, 25 basis point every othe r meeting, no plan to follow any 
type of mechanical approach to r aising the federal funds rate.  We will evaluate incoming 
conditions and move in the manner that we regard as appropriate .  So that’s one lesson.  You 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 9 of 23 
 know, conceivably, I think, with t he benefit of hindsight, it m ight have been better to raise rates 
more rapidly or more duri ng the 2004–06 cycle.  You know, I’m n ot certain of that judgment, but 
I think there’s a case to be made. 
You asked about Audit the Fed and the Shelby bill.  The Shelby bill has a title in it that 
addresses a number of issues  pertaining to the Fed.  I suppose I would ask, what exactly is the 
problem?  We place high priorit y on being an accountable and tr ansparent central bank, and I 
think that if you compare the t ransparency of monetary policy d ecisions in the Federal Reserve 
with other central banks, we are  one of the most transparent ce ntral banks in terms of the 
information that we provide to t he public in a whole variety of  ways.  To my mind, the Fed is 
accountable, and we work well as  an institution.  I’m not certa in what the problem is that needs 
to be addressed. 
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.   First 
question is also referencing som ething that Bill Dudley said re cently, which is to do with the use 
of the balance sheet in tight ening monetary policy.  He suggest ed that the short rates should be 
hiked some way from the zero lo wer bound before the Fed continu es—considers ending 
reinvestments.  I wondered if  you could give a little bit more clarity on how the Fed intends to 
approach the issue of ending rei nvestments on its balance sheet .  Would you, for instance, see 
any argument for tapering the e nd to reinvestments to smooth th e profile of maturities in the 
portfolio?  The second question is really on this point of “gra dual”—you’ve used this term today 
in the opening statement.  Is the term “gradual” on its way to becoming official guidance from 
the Fed?  Is this something we should start to expect to see po pping up in official FOMC 
statements in future?  Thanks.

 CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start w ith the balance sheet and our r einvestment policy.  
We issued a normalization state ment giving principles of normal izing policy, and what we said 
at that time is that we expected  to reduce or cease reinvestmen t at some time after we had begun 
the process of normalizing polic y by raising our target for the  federal funds rate.  We said the 
timing of that would depend on economic and financial condition s, and the Committee has really 
not made any further decisions  about how it’s going to go about  doing that, so President Dudley 
was expressing his own personal po int of view.  But this is a m atter that the Committee has not 
yet decided, and I can’t provide  any further detail.  It’s obvi ously something we will be thinking 
about. 
Let’s see, you asked about “grad ual.”  So, in a sense, we alrea dy have a statement.  The 
last paragraph of the Federal Ope n Market Committee statement s ays:  “The Committee 
currently anticipates that, eve n after employment and inflation  are near mandate-consistent 
levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping  the target federal funds rate 
below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.”  That’s kind of a mouthful.  It’s 
a long sentence, but I think the s pirit of that sentence is con sistent with my use of the word 
“gradual,” and it is consistent  with what you see in the Summar y of Economic Projections.  
Participants are projecting—obvious ly there is a lot of uncerta inty, but they’re projecting 
increases that average ar ound 100 basis points per year.  Now, that’s not a promise, it’s 
conditional on their economic forecasts, and those forecasts ma y prove to be wrong and may 
change.  But at this time, the assessmen t that participants have of the economy suggest to them 
that the appropriate pace of normalization to keep the economy on track to meet our objectives 
will be gradual, in that sense. 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 11 of 23 
 PETER COOK.  Peter Cook with Bloom berg Television.  Madam Chair , if I could, just 
given your discussions over the past two days with your colleag ues, the state of the economy 
right now, the improvements you’ve seen, do you think it’s stil l likely that we’ll see a rate 
increase this year?  And to fo llow on that, something Ylan ment ioned—that is, the comment 
from the IMF recently, earlier t his month, and the encouragemen t you got from the IMF to hold 
off on raising rates until next ye ar.  Specifically, they said— your colleague Madam Lagarde 
mentioned specifically the risk— that even though there’s a risk  of slight inflation by doing that, 
that there was concern that a ra te hike could trigger market vo latility, with fin ancial stability 
consequences that go well  beyond the U.S. borders.  How do you respond to those concerns?  
Are you factoring in that interna tional context to your decisio nmaking?  And was  it appropriate 
for the IMF to make those kinds of specific recommendations?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So your first qu estion was about a rate i ncrease this year.  You 
know, again, the Committee tries to  give an indication in the S ummary of Economic Projections 
about how economic conditions will unfold, their best projectio ns of that and what the 
appropriate policy will be give n in light of those expectations .  And, clearly, most participants 
are anticipating that a rate increase this  year will be appropr iate. 
Now, that assumes, as you can s ee, that they’re expecting a pic kup in growth in the 
second half of this year and furth er improvement in labor marke t conditions.  And we will all 
be—we will be making decisions  however that depend on the actua l data that we see in the 
months ahead.  So, certainly, we could see data in the months a head that will justify the 
expectations that you see in the  so-called dot plot.  But, agai n, the important point is, no decision 
has been made by the Committee about what the right timing is o f an increase.  It will depend on 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 12 of 23 
 unfolding data in the months ah ead.  But, certainly, an increas e this year is possible.  We could 
certainly see data that would justify that. 
In terms the IMF guidance, you know , I believe the IMF plays a very useful role by 
undertaking reviews of the econom ic policies of all of its memb ers.  Obviously, there is a range 
of opinion among outside observers a nd market participants as w ell as among the Committee’s 
participants, as you can see in the SEP, about how economic con ditions are likely to unfold and, 
consequently, the appropriate ti ming of an initial rate hike.  I think, however, we all agree, and 
the IMF agrees, that policies should be data dependent, and the  Committee is always doing its 
best to assess the implicati ons of incoming data.  I would poin t out that we have had incoming 
data since that report was writt en.  But, again, I want to emph asize—and I think the IMF would 
agree with this—that the impor tance of the timing of a first de cision to raise rates is something 
that should not be overb lown, whether it’s September or Decembe r or March—what matters is 
the entire path of rates.  And, as I’ve said, the Committee ant icipates economic conditions that 
would call for a gradual evolut ion of the fed funds rate toward  normalization. 
With respect to international sp illovers, this is something tha t we have been long attentive 
to.  Obviously, we have to put in pl ace a policy that is approp riate to evolving conditions in the 
U.S. economy, but we can’t promise that there will not be volat ility when we make a decision to 
raise rates.  What we can do is to do our very best to communic ate clearly about our policy and 
our expectations to avoid any type  of needless misunderstanding  of our policy that could create 
volatility in the market and potential spillovers as well to em erging markets, and I have been 
trying to do that now for some ti me.  I’ve been doing my best t o make good on that pledge. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsi nger with the Associated Press.   You just talked 
about the fact that you can’t prom ise that there won’t be volat ility in the markets.  There seem to 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 13 of 23 
 be two schools of thought.  One is that the Fed learned from th e mistakes made in the—2013 
with the taper tantrum, and tha t you’re going to telegraph this  so well that that will limit it.  And 
the more pessimistic school of thought seems to be that when yo u do start raising rates, they’ve 
been low for so long that it’s goi ng to be—make the taper tantr um seem mild by comparison.  
Which camp are you falling in on that? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I think our experien ce suggests that it’s hard t o have great confidence 
in predicting what the market reaction will be to Fed decisions , and there have been surprises in 
the past.  I don’t think the Comm ittee anticipated that its dec ision would cause the taper tantrum.  
And all I can say is that uncerta inty in the markets at this po int about long-term rates doesn’t 
appear to be unusually high, and w e can only do what is in our power to attempt to minimize 
needless volatility that could have repercussions for other cou ntries or for financial stability more 
generally, and that is to attempt to communicate as clearly as we can about our policy decisions, 
what they will depend on, and what we are looking at. 
We will be responding to incoming data.  We’ve tried to make th at clear.  And I think it’s 
clear that the market is als o responding to incoming data, and you can see that in daily market 
reactions to surprises in t he economic data.  And, of course, n one of us can quite forecast what 
incoming data will be. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Your latest economic projections show that  you expect the 
unemployment rate—or, many officials expect the unemployment ra te—to fall more slowly this 
year and then to fall, by impli cation, more quickly next year.  Could you talk about what has 
changed in your assessment of the  labor market and how that inf luences the path of policy? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we are—productiv ity growth has been—is a fact or that affects the 
pace of improvement in the labor  market.  Productivity growth h as been extremely slow for the 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 14 of 23 
 last couple of years, and I think, in part, the pace of improve ment in the labor market that we’re 
projecting reflects th e notion that there’s likely to be some p ickup in the pace of productivity 
growth.  Obviously, that’s someth ing that’s quite uncertain, an d it’s conceivable that if 
productivity growth disappoints— something I hope that we won’t see, because that has very 
negative implications  for living standards—we could conceivably  see faster improvement in the 
labor market. 
But, in addition, there are other margins of slack that don’t s how up in the unemployment 
rate.  Labor force participation that has, at least, is—appears  to be depressed, at least to some 
extent, because of cyclical wea kness, and the fact that labor f orce participation rate has remained 
roughly stable for the last year  or so when there’s an underlyi ng downward trend suggests that 
some slack is being taken up by, in a sense, improved or dimini shed cyclical impact on labor 
force participation.  I expect t hat to continue, and I would ex pect also to see some improvement 
in the degree of part-time employ ment that’s for economic reaso ns. 
JONATHAN SPICER.  Jonathan Spi cer with Reuters.  To your point,  Madam Chair, on 
needing more decisive evidence i n order to initiate the first r ate hike, how close do you feel the 
economy is to full capacity now ?  And given that, you know, emp loyer costs and monthly wages 
are at a pace that’s at a six-y ear high now, what is the risk—o r, how does the risk change that 
inflation could strengthen qui cker than you’re expecting? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the Committee es timates that the longer-run n ormal level of the 
unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.  A t 5.5 percent, where we have  an unemployment rate that still 
exceeds the Committee’s best attempts to estimate what is a nor mal unemployment rate for this 
economy, and, as I mentioned, the re appear to be unusually larg e elements of slack over and 
above that in the form of somewha t still-depressed labor force participation and part-time work 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 15 of 23 
 for economic reasons.  So I think it ’s fair to say that most me mbers, most participants on the 
Committee, wouldn’t judge yet—al though some might—that most wou ldn’t judge us to be at, 
quote, “maximum employment.”  
Wage increases are still running a t a low level, but there have  been some tentative signs 
that wage growth is picking up.  W e have seen an increase in th e growth rate of the employment 
cost index and a mild uptick in t he growth of average hourly ea rnings.  I would call these 
tentative signs of stronger wag e growth.  I think it’s not yet definitive, but that is a hopeful sign. 
Still, however, inflation—not onl y headline, but, stripping out  food and energy 
underlying inflation, core inflat ion—is still running below the  Committee’s objective.  So I think 
we need to see additional strength in the labor market and the economy moving somewhat closer 
to capacity—the output gap shrin king—in order to have confidenc e that inflation will move back 
up to 2 percent, but we have made some progress. 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb fro m MarketWatch.  I’d like t o turn your 
attention to the housing market  for a question.  Both rents and  house prices have been rising 
rapidly recently, squeezing Ame ricans on both sides.  How comfo rtable are you with this, and 
does it impact monetary policy?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, the  house—the increase in house pr ices is restoring 
wealth of many households who have t hat as their major asset.  It is an important part of the 
wealth of American household—the A merican household sector.  An d for all of the households 
that were underwater, those house  price increases are improving  their financial condition, 
although, of course, at the same time, it’s making housing less  affordable for those who look 
to buy. 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 16 of 23 
 At the same time, housing overall, given the low levels—still l ow level of mortgage rates, 
remains quite affordable.  I thi nk credit availability remains quite constrained for mortgages.  
Anyone who doesn’t have a pristine credit rating is—finds it ve ry difficult at th is point to qualify 
for a mortgage, and I think we’re  seeing quite a bit of relucta nce, given the job market and given 
what the history of what’s  happened to house prices, of young p eople to want to buy homes.  
We’ve seen them delay marriage and wanting to have the flexibil ity to move.  So the demand for 
multifamily housing to rent is very high, and rent prices are m oving up, I think, because of that. 
JEREMY TORDJMAN.  Hi, Jeremy To rdjman with Agence France-Presse .  I have a 
question on Europe.  As you know, the re is a growing political gridlock on Greece, and the 
scenario of a “Grexit” is getting every day more likely.  So ho w concerned are you by these 
developments?  Do you feel it coul d impact the global and the U .S. economy, and could it 
influence in anywhere—in any way, sorry, when you will decide t o increase the interest rates? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well I—unfortunate ly, Greece and its creditors a re faced with very 
difficult and consequential de cisions at this point and in the days ahead, and my hope is that they 
will continue to work together to try to find a solution to the , you know, current difficulties and 
impasse.  Obviously, European lead ers place great value on pres erving European monetary, 
economic, and political integrati on, and the Greek people have made clear that it’s important to 
them to remain in the euro area .  So this is a very difficult s ituation. 
In the event that there is not  agreement, I do see the potentia l for disruptions that could 
affect the European economic ou tlook and global financial marke ts.  I would say that the United 
States has very limited direct e xposure to Greece, either throu gh trade and financial—or financial 
channels.  But to the extent that  there are impacts on the euro -area economy or on global 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 17 of 23 
 financial markets, there would undoubtedly be spillovers to the  United States that would affect 
our outlook as well. 
CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  C hris Condon from Bloomberg Ne ws.  
Madam Chair, I’d like to come b ack to the topic of consumer spe nding.  Consumer spending has 
been very disappointing for ma ny months in the U.S. economy.  I ’m wondering, do you think 
there has been a meaningful shift, and one that will persist in  the behavior of households, with 
respect to spending and savings ?  Or would you be more inclined  to look at the recent more 
encouraging retail sales figures  and see perhaps a return of th e American consumer there? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think in rece nt weeks we have received data  that suggest that 
consumer spending is growing at a moderate pace .  I’d say, you know, car sales, for example, 
were very strong.  Part of it proba bly represents payback for w eak sales during the winter 
months, but, nevertheless, the pa ce of car sales has been stron g.  And recent readings on retail 
sales and on spending on services  have suggested an improvement  in the pace of consumer 
spending.  
There are questions at this poi nt about just how much impact we ’ve seen of lower energy 
prices on consumer spending.  The d ecline in oil prices transla tes into an improvement in 
household income, on average, of  something like $700 per househ old, and I’m not convinced yet 
by the data that we have seen the  kind of response to that that  I would ultimately expect.  And I 
think it’s hard to know at this poi nt whether or not that refle cts a very cautious consumer that is 
eager to add to savings and t o work down borrowing.  Or, in par t, some survey evidence suggests 
that consumers are not yet confid ent that the improvement they’ ve seen—the decline in their 
need to spend for energy, for  gasoline—that that’s going to be something that will be permanent.  
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 18 of 23 
 They may think it’s a transito ry change and not yet be respondi ng.  So I think the jury is out 
there, but I think we have see n some pickup in household spendi ng. 
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox B usiness.  Madam Chair, I want ed to shift over to 
the decision in the AIG case this past Monday.  And in it, the judge in the case said in his 
opinion, quote, “There is nothing in the Federal Reserve Act or  any other federal statute that 
would permit a Federal Reserve Ba nk to take over  a private corp oration and run its business as if 
the government were the owner, ye t that is precisely what the F ederal Reserve Bank of New 
York did,” and the judge went on to cite the replacement of AIG ’s chief executive officer and 
taking control of AIG’s business  operations.  I wanted to ask y ou, did the Fed break the law in 
assisting AIG back in the crisi s?  And if this decision is uphe ld on appeal, how does that affect 
the Fed’s toolbox?  How does it a ffect its ability to help firm s in trouble in a future financial 
crisis?  Would it make that ki nd of assistance illegal, or woul d you have to get Congress to 
change the law and make a fix?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the Federal Res erve strongly believes that it s actions with respect 
to AIG in 2008 were legal, proper,  and effective, and it believ es that they were necessary, given 
the threat that a disorderly f ailure of that company would have  likely implications for the 
economy, for the flow of credit to households, in businesses in  the economy.  And it believes that 
the—we believe that the terms of  that intervention were tough, and appropriately so, in order to 
protect taxpayers from the risks  that those rescue loans presen ted at the time they were made. 
Now, I should emphasize that D odd-Frank changed our 13(3) autho rity and said that the 
Federal Reserve may not in a futur e crisis intervene to attempt  to address the issues of a 
particular company.  At the same time, it gave the government a  set of new tools that it could use 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 19 of 23 
 in a situation like the AIG situ ation or Lehman to try to resol ve such a situation that poses 
systemic risks in an orderly way. 
The—I’d just say at this point, t he Federal Reserve under Dodd- Frank can continue, if 
necessary, in some future crisis to engage in broad-based progr ams similar to the program we 
had in effect—the programs we  had in effect in 2008 to provide support for the issuance of asset-
backed securities that enabled l oans to small businesses and to  students and for credit cards and, 
you know, for credit throughout t he economy, or to support the issuance of commercial paper.  
At this point, I believe we are w orking with the Department of Justice to decide on next steps. 
MARK HAMRICK.  Madam Chair, Mark H amrick with Bankrate.com.  So  much 
discussion about rising rates s eems to focus on the potential n egatives, and I’m  wondering if you 
could talk a little b it if you envision some possible unintende d benefits of higher rates.  And one 
of the things I’m thinking about i s the fact tha t savers have s uffered through so many years of 
miserly returns, and many may be actually anticipating in a pos itive way seeing a better return on 
their investment.  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me say, to my  mind, the most important po sitive is that it—I 
believe a decision to raise rates  would signify very clearly th at the U.S. economy has made great 
progress in recovering from the tr auma of the financial crisis and that we’re in a different place.  
I think, hopefully, that would be  something that would be confi dence-inducing for many 
households and businesses. 
From the point of view of savers , of course this has been a ver y difficult period.  Many 
retirees—and I hear from some a lmost every day—are really suffe ring from low rates that they 
had anticipated would bolster the ir retirement income.  This, y ou know, obviously has been one 
of the adverse consequen ces of a period of low rates. 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 20 of 23 
 The—you know, we have a good reason for having kept rates at th e levels that we have.  
We—our charge from Congress is to pursue the goals of maximum e mployment and price 
stability.  That’s what we’ve  been doing.  And obviously there are benefits from a strong 
economy to every household in the e conomy, including savers, fr om having a better job market 
and a more secure economy.  But, ye s, when the time comes for u s to raise rates, I think there 
will be some benefits tha t flow through to savers. 
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times .  Just to follow up on 
that question, I think a lot of s avers, people on fixed incomes , were hopeful that they would see a 
rate increase if not this meeti ng, soon.  What sort—what kind o f assurances can you give them 
and people out there who think the  Fed is never going to raise rates?  I’ve got some e-mails today 
from people saying, “They’re never going to raise rates.”  What  kind of assurance can you give 
to people who are waiting for that to happen? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I can’t give an i ronclad promise, but I think it ’s clear from our 
Summary of Economic Projections t hat we anticipate that the eco nomy will grow, that the labor 
market will improve, that inflation will move back up to 2 perc ent as we—is our objective over 
the medium term.  And if economi c conditions unfold in the way that most of my colleagues and 
I anticipate, we see it as appr opriate to raise rates.  And, as  you can see, the largest number of 
participants anticip ate that those conditi ons should be in plac e later this year. 
Obviously, we have to—you know, there  can be surprises—that mig ht not happen.  It’s 
not an ironclad guarantee, but we an ticipate that that’s someth ing that will be appropriate later 
this year. 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby wit h Dow Jones Newswires.  Could you  shed some 
additional light on how large rev erse repo operations are likel y to be in their in itial phase?  And, 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 21 of 23 
 additionally, how important are f inancial conditions to the pac e of the Fed’s tightening cycle?  I 
mean, how important is the mark et’s reaction in determining how  fast or slow and the ultimate 
endpoint of a Fed tightening cycle? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, with respect  to—you asked first about overni ght reverse repos.  
And we communicated in our minutes  that the Committee has an in tention to make sure that they 
are available—overnight repos a re available in large quantity a t liftoff to ensure that we have a 
smooth liftoff, that there will  be an elevated level of provisi on of overnight RRP.  However, it is 
our expectation and plan that fair ly quickly after liftoff we w ill reduce the level of the overnight 
RRP facility, and we have a variet y of ways in which we can do that. 
With respect to market reactions , we always, in evaluating the economic outlook, have to 
take account of financial conditi ons, whether it’s the level of  long-term interest rates or the value 
of the dollar in assessing the economic outlook.  To the extent  that there are market reactions and 
market movements, whether they’ re in reaction to decisions of o urs or in reaction to other 
events—foreign events or unfolding economic conditions—we will always take those into 
account in deciding on the appr opriate path of policy. 
STEVE BECKNER.  Steve Beckne r of MNI.  Madam Chair, good to see  you.  You 
mentioned that the dollar ha s stabilized.  And, in fact, since mid-March, I believe it’s given up a 
good bit of its gains from last summer.  To what extent now do you think that there will be an 
ongoing drag from the dollar, taki ng into account this dollar r etreat?  And, overall, how 
important is the dollar exchange  rate in monetary policy these days relative to the past? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think we s till are, since last summer—ha ve seen an 
appreciable increase in the valu e of the dollar vis-à-vis most of our trading partners, including 
emerging markets.  So it is a si gnificant appr eciation of the d ollar, and I think we have seen that 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 22 of 23 
 it’s had a negative effect on net e xports and so served as some thing of a drag on the economy, 
and probably that drag is going to c ontinue for some time to co me.  So it is a factor affecting the 
outlook.  In addition, import pri ces for non-oil imports contin ue to fall, and I thi nk that’s serving 
to push down core inflation a littl e bit.  Eventually, I expect  that impact to ebb, but it is a factor 
affecting the outlook. 
That said, we obviously have no target for the dollar.  We take  movements in the dollar 
and its economic impact as one of  many factors affecting the ou tlook.  And, in spite of the 
appreciation of the dollar, the  Committee obviou sly thinks that  the economy is likely to do well 
enough to call—likely call for some  tightening later this year.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker .  I’d like to ask a 
regulatory question, if I could.  L ast month, Senator Elizabeth  Warren and Congressman Elijah 
Cummings sent a letter to the  GAO asking about an inquiry into the Fed and other regulators’ 
implementation of the Communit y Reinvestment Act, a concern bei ng that the CRA, as it’s 
implemented now, is not giving communities—blighted communities , like in Baltimore or other 
places—enough access to basic banking services.  Do you think t hat the Fed is doing everything 
it can in its CRA implementation t o give access to those commun ities to these kinds of services?  
Do you think it needs to be doing more? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we take CRA ver y seriously and evaluate for t hose banks that we 
supervise.  We have a set of gui delines and are very conscienti ous in attempting to evaluate CRA 
performance.  It’s something tha t we certainly take into accoun t in assessing applications that we 
receive for mergers, and we have  very active programs to try to  bring together community 
groups with banking organizations t o try to provide them with i nformation about how they can 
June 17, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 23 of 23 
 assess community needs and best a ddress them.  But we are looki ng at CRA and continue to look 
to see whether there are ways i n which implementation could be improved.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
September  17, 2015 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  As you know from our policy statement released a 
short time ago,  the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed the current 0 to ¼ percent target 
range for the federal funds rate.  Since the Committee  met in July, the pace of job gains has been 
solid, the unemployment rate has declined, and  overall labor market conditions have continued to 
improve.  I nflation , however,  has continued to run  below our longer -run objective , partly 
reflecting declines in energy and import prices.  While we still expect that the downward 
pressure on inflation from these factors will fade over time , recent global economic and financial 
developments are like ly to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.  These 
developments may also restrain U.S. activity somewhat  but have not led at this point to a 
significant change in the Committee ’s outlook for the U.S. economy.  
The Committee continues to anticipate  that the first increase in the federal funds rate will 
be appropriate when  it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably 
confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term .  It 
remains the case that the Committee will determine the timing of the initial increase based on its 
assessment of the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook .  I will note 
that the importance of the initial increase should not be overstated :  The stance of monetary  
policy will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time after the initial increase in 
the federal funds rate in order to support continued progress toward our objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inf lation.  I will come back to today ’s policy decision in a few 
moments, but first I would like to review recent economic developments and the outlook.  
Smoothing through the quarterly volatility, U.S. real gross domestic product is estimated 
to have expanded  at a 2 ¼ percent pace in the first half of the year, a notably stronger outcome

 than expected in June, when Committee participants had submitted economic projections.  
Continued job gains and increases in real disposable income have supported household spe nding.  
Growth in business fixed investment was moderate, held down in part by a significant 
contraction in oil drilling activity as a result of the large drop in oil prices over the past year.  
Moreover, net exports were a substantial drag on GDP growth d uring the first half of the year, 
reflecting the earlier appreciation of the dollar and weaker foreign demand.  T he Committee 
continues to expect a moderate pace of overall GDP growth even though the restraint from net 
exports is likely to persist for a ti me. 
The labor market has shown further progress so far this year toward our objective of 
maximum employment.  Over the past three months, job gains averaged 220,000 per month.  The 
unemployment rate, at 5.1 percent in August, was down 0.4 percent from the latest reading 
available at the time of our June meeting , although that decline was accompanied by some 
reduction in the labor force participation rate over the same period.  A broader measure of 
unemployment that includes individuals who want and are avai lable to work but have not 
actively searched recently and people who are working part time but would rather work full time  
has continued to improve .  That said, some cyclical weakness likely remains:  While the 
unemployment rate is close to most FOMC parti cipants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal 
level, the participation rate is still below estimates of its underlying trend , involuntary part -time 
employment remains elevated, and wage growth remains subdued . 
Inflation has continued to run below our 2 perce nt objective, partly reflecting declines in 
energy and import prices.  My colleagues and I continue to expect that the effects of these factors 
on inflation will be transitory.  However, the recent additional decline in oil prices and further 
appreciation of the dollar mean that it will take a bit more time for these effects to fully dissipate.  
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 3 of 23 
 Accordingly, the Committee anticipates that inflation will remain quite low in the coming 
months.  As these temporary effects fade and, importantly, as the labor ma rket improves further, 
we expect inflation to move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective .  Survey -based 
measures of longer -term inflation exp ectations have remained stable.  However, the Committee 
has taken note of recent declines in m arket -based m easures of inflation compensation  and will 
continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.  
This assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections 
submitted for this meeting by FOMC participants , which now extend through 20 18.  As 
announced in the minutes from our July meeting, we are also introducing a modest enhancement 
to the Summary of Economic Projections by publishing the median projection across FOMC 
participants.  These medians provide a concise summary statistic of participants ’ perspectives.  
They should not, however, be interpreted as a collective view or a Committee forecast.  As 
always, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate 
monetary policy.  
Reflecting upward revision s for the first half of the year, participants increased their 
projections for economic growth this year,  compared with the projections made in conjunction 
with the June FOMC meeting.  T he median growth projection is 2.1 percent for this year and 
rises to 2.3 percent in 2016, somewhat above the median estimate of the longer -run normal 
growth rate.  Thereafter, the median growth projection declines toward its longer -run rate.  The 
unemployment rate projections  are a bit lower than in June.  At the end of thi s year, the median 
unemployment rate projection stands at 5 percent , down 0.3 percent from June and close to the 
median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate .  Committee participants generally 
see the unemployment rate declining a little furt her next year and then leveling out .  Finally, 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 4 of 23 
 FOMC participants project inflation to be very low this year, largely reflecting lower energy and 
non-energy import prices .  As the transitory factors holding down inflation abate and labor 
market conditions c ontinue to firm, the median inflation projection rises from just 0.4 percent 
this year to 1.7  percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2018 .  The path of the median inflation 
projections is a bit lower than in June.  
The outlook abroad appears to have bec ome more uncertain of late, and heightened 
concerns about growth in China and other emerging market economies have led to notable 
volatility in financial markets.  Developments since our July meeting —including the drop in 
equity prices, the further appreci ation of the dollar, and a widening in risk spreads —have 
tightened overall financial conditions to some extent.  These developments may restrain U.S. 
economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the 
near term.  Given the significant economic and financial interconnections between the United 
States and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching.   
Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on 
today ’s policy decision.  The recovery from the Great Recession has advanced sufficiently far 
and domestic spending appears sufficiently robust that an argument can be made for a rise in 
interest rates at this time.  We discussed this possibility at our meeting.  However, in light of the 
heightened uncertainties abroad and a slightly softer expected path for inflation, the Committee 
judged it appropriate to wait for more evidence, including some further improvement in the labor 
market, to bolster its confidence th at inflation will rise to 2 percent in the medium term.  Now, I 
do not want to overplay the implications of these recent developments, which have not 
fundamentally altered our outlook.  The economy has been performing well, and we expect it to 
continue to do so.  
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 5 of 23 
 As I noted earlier, i t remains the case that the timing of the initial increase in the federal 
funds rate will depend on the Committee ’s assessment of the implications of incoming 
information for the economic outlook .  To be clear, our decision wil l not hinge on any particular 
data release or on day -to-day movements in financial markets.  Instead, the decision will depend 
on a wide range of economic and financial indicators and our assessment of their cumulative 
implications for actual and expected progress toward our objectives.  
Let me again emphasize that the specific timing of the initial increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate is far less important for the economy than the entire expected path of 
interest rates .  And o nce we begin  to remove policy accommodation, we continue to expect that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the 
target federal funds rate.   
Compared with the projections made in June, many FOMC participants lowered 
somewhat their paths for the federal funds rate, including estimates of the longer -run normal 
level.  Most participants continue to expect that economic conditions will make it appropriate to 
raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this yea r, although four participants now 
expect that such con ditions will not be seen until next year or later .  The median projection for 
the federal funds rate rises to about 1 ½ percent  in late 2016, 2 ½ percent in late 2017, and 
3½ percent in 2018.  In 2016 and 2017, the medians are about ¼ percentage point below those 
projected in June.  The median projected rate in 2017 remains below the rate that most 
participants expect to prevail in the longer run despite the fact that the media n projection has the 
unemployment rate slightly below its longer -run normal level and inflation close to our 2 percent 
objective .  Participants provide d a number of explanations  for their low federal funds rate 
projections.  These included, in particular, the residual effects of the financial crisis, which are 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 6 of 23 
 likely to continue to constrain spending for some time , as well as headwinds from abroad .  But 
the restraining influence of these  factors on real activity —as the  restraining influence of these  
factors  on real activity  dissipate s further, most participants expect the federal funds rate to move 
to its longer -run normal level by the end of 2018.  
I’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, 
as usual, are cond itional on participants ’ individual projections of the most likely outcomes for 
economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors.  But our actual policy actions over 
time will depend on how economic conditions evolve, which is quite uncertain.  If  the expansion 
proves to be more vigorous than currently anticipated and inflation moves higher than expected, 
then the appropriate path would likely follow a steeper and higher trajectory .  Conversely, if 
conditions were to prove weaker, then the appropri ate trajectory would be lower and less steep.  
Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of rei nvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and  mortgage -backed securities .  
The Committee ’s sizable holding s of longer -term securities should help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions and promote further progress toward our objectives.  
Thank you .  Let me stop there.  I’ll be happy to take your questions.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman, CNBC.   Madam Chair, this notion of uncertainty in 
economic and global developments —is it fair to say that it could be many months before those 
global developments work their way t hrough  the U .S. economic data, and that you would not 
have the certainty that you ’re looking for to raise interest rates for many months and perhaps 
well into next year?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   Well, Steve, I think you can see from the SEP projections that most 
participants continue d to think that economic conditions wil l call for or make appropr iate a n 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 7 of 23 
 increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this year.  Four participants moved their 
projections into 2016 or later, but the great majority of participants continued to hold that view .  
And, of course, there will always be uncertainty.  We ca n’t expect that uncertainty to be fully 
resolved.  But, in light of the developments that we have seen and the impacts on financial 
markets, we want to take a little bit more time to evaluate the likely impacts on the United States.  
And, as I mentioned, t he inflation outlook has softened slightly.  We’ve had some further 
developments —namely , lower oil prices and a further appreciation of the dollar —that have put 
some downward pressure in the near term on inflation.  Now, we fully expect those further 
effec ts, like the earlier moves in the dollar and in oil prices , to be transitory .  But there is a little 
bit of downward pressure on inflation , and we would like to see some further developments .  
And this , importantly , could include —is likely to include —further improvements in the labor 
market that would bolster our confidence tha t inflation will move back to 2  percent over the 
medium term.  
SAM FLEMING.   Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.   Could I ask about the next 
meeting, which is in October ?  Do you view that as a live meeting even though there isn ’t going 
to be a scheduled press conference at that time ?  And what kind of developments would you 
need to see to be confident in moving in the near term ?  Is it more important , the developments  
in the fin ancial market s, or is it more to do with the upcoming data?  Thanks very much.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, as I ’ve said before, every meeting is a live meeting where the 
Committee can make a decision to move to change our target for the federal funds rate.  That 
certainly includes October.  As you know , and I ’ve stressed previously, were we to decide to do 
that, we would call a press briefing , and you ’ve participated in an exercise to make sure that you 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 8 of 23 
 would know how to participate in that press briefing should it happen.  So, yes, October remains 
a possibility.  
And we will be looking at incoming developments , both financial an d economic , to try to 
make sure w e feel , really , that the U .S. economy is doing well.  You know, I want to emphasize , 
domestic developments have been strong.  We see domestic demand growing at a solid pace, the 
labor market  continuing to improve.  Of course, we will watch incoming data to confirm our 
expectation that that will continue.   And we , of course , will watch glo bal financial and economic 
development s.  I can ’t give you a recipe for exactly what we ’re looking to see , but, as we say, we 
want to see continued improvement in the labor market , and we would like to bolster our 
confidence tha t inflation will move back t o 2 percent .  And, of course, a further improv ement in 
the labor market does  serve that purpose.  There could be other things we would see that could 
bolster that confidence , but further improvement in the labor market will serve to do that.  
JIM PUZZANGHER A.  Hi.  Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.   There were a group 
of protesters out here before your meeting.  There was  a similar group at Jackson Hole .  They 
and others have warned the F ed not to raise the rate because —out of concern that the labor 
market is not fully healed, wages haven ’t risen fast enough .  What impact, if any, has that had on 
you and your colleagues in your decision today?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, we have been receiving advice from a large number of 
economists and interested groups , and that ’s of course appropriate , and we value hearing the 
opinions of many —you know, many different groups and individuals with different perspectives.   
But, look, at the end of the day, it ’s the Committee ’s job to come together to analyze the data that 
we have on the economy , to decide how it affects the outlook , and to try to deliberate and arrive 
at a Committee judgment about the appropriate path of policy, and that ’s what we did today.  As 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 9 of 23 
 I said, although we are close to many participant ’s [estimates]  and the median estimate of the 
longer -run normal rate of unemployment, at least my own judgment —and this has been true for a 
long time —is that there are additional margins of slack , particularly relating to very high levels 
of part -time involuntary employme nt and labor force participation , that suggest that , at least to 
some extent , the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market.  
But we are getting closer.  The labor market has improved.  And, as I’ve said in the past, we  
don’t want to wait until we ’ve fully met both of our objectives to begin the process of tightening 
policy give n the lags in the operation of  monetary policy.  
KATE DAVIDSON.  Thank you.  Kate Davidson from the Wall Street Journal.   Madam 
Chair, do you thin k, over the past two months since your last meeting , that you ’ve gotten clos er 
to or further away from the F ed’s inflation goals ?  And then , separately, you ’ve received a 
congressional subpoena relating to the disc losure of information from the F ed’s Septe mber 2012 
policy meeting.  Are you any closer to complyin g with that ?  Have you turned over any new 
information to Congress?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, your first question was, have we come closer or move d further  
away  from our inflation goal.  So we ’ve used the same language , which is  that we expect to 
achieve our 2 present goal over the medium term , and I would say , although we —as we say in 
our statement, recent developments seem likely to put some downward pressure .  We’re, after 
all, way below our inflation target.   But an important reason for that is that declines in  import 
prices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and decline s in energy prices are holding down 
inflation well below our target and well below core inflation.  We expect those effects to be 
transitory , and with well -anchored inflation expectations, we expect inflation to move  back to 
2 percent .  Now, in the intermeeting period, we have seen some further appreciation of the dollar 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 10 of 23 
 and some further downward pressure on energy prices , and that creates a bit of further drag on 
inflation that I would view as transitory —is very likely to be transitory.  So I continue and the 
Committee continues to expect tha t inflation will move back to 2 percent , so this should be a 
smal l thing.  And, in the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve, so a tighter labor 
market, a labor market moving toward full employment , is one t hat historically has generated 
upward  pressure on inflation.  So that bolsters my confidence in infl ation.   On the other hand, 
we’ve had a long period in which inflation has been running below our objective.  I consider it , 
and the Committee does , very important that we —we achieve our inflation objective and defend 
against inflation that is persistently above our inflation objective and also persistently below our 
inflation objective.  And we want to have not only an expectation , but a good degree of 
confidence that that will occur.  We did take note in the statement of a decline in inflation 
compensation , and it ’s hard to get a direct read on inflation expectations out of these measures.   
They can be pushed down by factors pertaining to liquidit y in the T reasury —in the TIPs  market 
and other issues pertaining to risk premia, but we have taken note of that , and I would say that 
that’s something that has caught our attention and is a  factor that we ’re watching.  So we ’d like 
to have a little bit more confidence , but I would not interpret developments during the 
intermeeting period as significantly undermining confidence.  And the labor market is really 
important that as it continues to improve —it has , and we want to see it improve further —that 
serves to bolster c onfidence.  
Oh, I’m sorry , you asked about the September 2012 leak.  We are working very closely 
with House Financial Services C ommittee that ’s requested information to satisfy their request.  
We’re working very closely with them.  
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L

 BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya  Appelbaum, the New York Times.   The economic 
projections that you all released today show that Committee members expect roughly a three -
year period in which the unemployment rate will be at its lowest sustainable level and yet 
inflation will not rise abov e 2 percent.  That seems extraordinary .  Could you talk about why , as 
a moment ago you said we would expect  inflationary pressures when unemployment is at a low 
level?   Why is inflation going to be so weak for so long under those circumstances , and does it  
indicate —when you are projecting that basically much of a decade will have passed without the 
Fed reaching its inflation target —does it indicate that you have failed to do enough to revive this 
economy in recent years?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we have been very focused, Binya, on doing everything we can 
to revive this economy and to achieve our maximum employment objective.  And after we took 
the funds rate down to zero, as you know, we put in place a number of other extraordinary 
measures —including forward guidance and large -scale asset purchases —in order to speed the 
recovery and attain both our inflation objective and our maximum employment objective.  And, I 
mean , when you look at the projection, you see , as you mentioned , that we see s ufficient growth 
to push the unemployment rate.  It’s already very close to participants ’ estimates of its longer -run 
normal level.  We expect the unemployment rate to fall slightly —or, at least , participants project 
that it will fall slightly below that l evel.  As that occurs, we would expect labor force 
participation, the cyclical component of that , to diminish over time , and we would hope to see 
some decline in the portion of slack that ’s reflected in high levels of part -time involuntary 
employment.  
Now,  inflation is going back in our projection to 2 percent .  It takes to 2018 to get there.  
It’s awfully close in 2017 , and it ’s not terribly far away even next year.  We have very large 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 12 of 23 
 drags from import prices and energy prices , and over the next  year or so, those things should 
dissipate .  And the behavior of inflation should mainly —if we —if our understanding of the 
inflationary process is correct and if inflation exp ectations are well anchored at 2 , which I 
believe they are , as the labor market heals and a s that healing progresses, we will see further 
upward pressure on inflation.  That’s what we expect.  Now, it ’s a slow process, it ’s 
characterized by lags , and that ’s why it takes a few years as the inflation —as the unemployment 
rate falls and even overshoots its longer -run normal level, it just takes some time  for inflation to 
get back to 2 percent.  But the overshooting helps it  get back faster than it otherwise would .  And 
it’s certainly important for us , and I think our credibility hinges on defe nding our inflat ion target 
not only from threats  that it rises above , but also that we not have —that over the medium term , 
that we want  to see inflation get back to 2 percent .  And we believe the policies we ’re following 
are des igned to accomplish that and  will do so.  
YLAN MUI.  Hi, thanks.   Ylan from the Washington Post.   I want to kind of piggybac k 
on Binya ’s question a little bit and brin g up the old thresholds of 6.5 percent unemployment and 
2.5 percent  inflation as the period during which the F ed promi sed to ke ep interest rates low.  
That had sort of assumed —I guess sort of suggested  that the F ed was comfortabl e with inflation 
rising above 2 percent .  But you just said moments ago that you don ’t want to wait until inflation 
actually hit s your target before you are ready to lift off.  So I wonder if you could explain that a 
little bit.  Is there a shift in how much inflation the Fed is actually willing to accept?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me be clear —2 percent is our objective.  We wan t to see  
inflation go back to 2 percent ; 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation.  So we ’re not trying to push 
the inflation rate above 2.  It’s always our ob jective to get back to 2, but 2 percent  is not a 
ceiling.  And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that , on average , 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 13 of 23 
 would hold the inflation rate below 2 percent .  That is not our policy.  We want to see t he 
inflation rate get back to 2 percent  as rapidly as we can.  But there are lags in the impact of 
monetary policy on the economy .  And if we waited until inflation is back to 2 —and that would 
probably mean that unemployment had declined well below our estimates of the natural rate —
and only then did we start to —begin to —and, you know, the word  “tighten” monetary policy I 
don’t think  is really right because we have an immensely accommodative monetary policy in 
place.  So, let me say, just to begin to diminish the extraordinary degree of accommodation for 
monetary policy, we would be overshoot —we would likel y overshoot substantially our  2 percent  
object ive, and we might be faced with then  having to tighten policy in a way that could be 
disruptive to the real economy.   And I don’t —I don ’t think that ’s a desirable way to conduct 
policy.  
JEANNA SMIALEK .  Jeanna S mialek , Bloomberg News.  You mentioned earlier that, 
you know, there is always going to be some uncertainty in the global economy, yet it seems that 
uncertainties are what kept you from hiking this month.  You know, ho w do you communicate to 
markets w hat is the kind of uncertainty  that keeps you from lifting rates and what is the kind of 
uncertainty you can overlook and, you know, move in spite of?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, that ’s a very hard question , and, you know, it ’s why we come 
together and have very careful evaluations of a wide ra nge of factors.  But, at the end of the day, 
what we ’re focused on are two things :  the path for employment and whether or not we feel 
confident that we ’re on a road that will take us to our maximum employment objective and 
whether or not we see the risks around obtaining that as balanced.   Of course , there will be 
uncertainty around it  and whether or not we have reasonable confidence that inflation,  will, ove r 
the medium term, go back to 2 percent .  And it ’s really through that filter that we ’re trying to 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 14 of 23 
 look at uncertainty.  Of course , there are ma ny uncertainties in the global economy , but we ’re 
asking ourselves how economic and financial developments in the global economy affect the risk 
to our outlook for our two goals and whether or not they create un balanced risks that we want to 
wait to resolve , to some extent.  
PETER BARNES.  Hi, Chair Yellen.   Peter Barnes, F ox Business.  Could you talk 
about —a little bit more specifically about what foreign developments you discussed in the 
meeting today, what you ’re concerned about?  We all assume it might be China —that was in the 
July minutes.  Are you concerned about the Chinese economy slowing , the markets there?  Do 
you have any concerns about the European economy?  And then , related to stock markets, could 
I ask you how you feel about U .S. equity markets right now ?  Because you did talk about your 
concerns about them back in May.  You saw they were generally quite high and were worried 
about potential dangers in U .S. equity market valuations , but now equity pri ces have pulled back.  
Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, with respect to global developments, we reviewed developments 
in all important areas of the world , but we ’re focused particularly on China and emerging 
markets.   Now, we ’ve long expected, as most analyst s have , to see some slowing in Chinese 
growth over time as they rebalance their economy.  And they have planned that , and  I think there 
are no surprises there.  The question is whether or not there might be a risk of a more abrupt 
slowdown than most analys ts expect.  And I think developments that we saw in financial markets 
in August in part reflected concerns that  Chinese —there was downside risk to Chinese economic 
performance and perhaps concerns about the de ftness with which policymakers were addressing 
those concerns.  
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 15 of 23 
 In addition, we saw a very substantial downward pressure on oil prices and commodity 
markets , and those developments have had a significant impact on many emerging market 
economies that are important producers of commodities as well as more  advanced countries , 
including Canada, which is an important trading partner of ours that has been negatively affected 
by declining commodity prices, declining energy prices.    
Now, there are a lot of countries that are net importers of energy that are pos itively 
affected by those developments , but emerging markets —important emerging markets —have 
been negatively affected by those developments.  And we ’ve seen significant outflows of capital 
from those countries, pressures on their exchange rates , and concerns about their performance 
going forward.  So a lot of our focus has been on risks around China , but not just China —
emerging markets , more generally , and how they may spill over to the United States.  In terms of 
thinking about financial develop ments and our reaction to them, I think a lot of the financial 
developments were really —so, we don ’t want to respond to market  turbulence.  The F ed should 
not be responding to the ups and downs of the markets , and it is certainly not our policy to do so.  
But when there are significant financial developments, it ’s incumbent on us to ask ourselves 
what is causing them.  And, of course , while we can ’t know for sure, it seem ed to us as though 
concerns about the global economic outlook were drivers of those fin ancial development s.  And 
so they have concerned us in part because they take us to the global outlook and how that will 
affect us.  And, to some extent, look, we have seen a tightening of financial conditions during —
as I mentioned, during the intermeeting  period.  So the stock market adjustment , combined with 
a somewhat stronger dollar and higher risk spreads , does represent some tightening of financial 
conditions.  
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 16 of 23 
 Now, in and of itself, it ’s not the end of story in terms of our policy because we have to 
put a lot of different pieces together.  We are looking at, as I emphasized, a U .S. economy that 
has been performing well and impressing us by the pace at which it ’s creating jobs and the 
strength of domestic demand.   So we have that.   We have some concerns  about negative impacts 
from global developments and some tightening of financial conditions.  We’re trying to put all of 
that together in a picture.   I think, importantly , we say in our statem ent that in spite of all of this , 
we continue to view the risks to economic activity and labor markets as balanced.  So it’s a lot of 
different pieces, different cross currents, some strengthening the outlook, some creating 
concerns, but overall, no significant change in the economic out look.  
ANN SAPHIR.   Ann Saphir with Reuters.  Just to piggyback on the global 
considerations —as you say, the U .S. economy has been growing .  Are you worried that , given 
the global interconnect ednes s, the low inflation globally, all of the other concerns tha t you just 
spoke about , that you may never escape from this zero lower bound situation ? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would be very —I would be very surprised if that ’s the case.  
That is not the way I see the outlook or the way the Committee sees the outlook.   Can I  
completely rule it out?  I can ’t completely rule it out.  But, really , that’s an ex treme downside 
risk that in no way is near the center of my outlook.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and T elevision.  If the 
economy develops as the Summary of Economic Projection s suggests , you will see improvement 
in labor markets , but it won ’t push inflation up any faster.  So I’m wondering what the argument 
is for raising rates this year as suggested by the dot plot, because even allowing for long a nd 
variable lags, you ’re not forecasting an inflation problem that would seem to suggest the need for 
a steeper and faster rate path for at least a couple of years.

 CHAIR YELLEN.   So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a 
very long ti me from here and the economy performs as we expect —namely , it’s strong and the 
risks that are out there don ’t materialize —my concern will be that we will have much more 
tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections .  And the lags will be pr obably 
slow, but eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation 
objective , and then we ’ll be forced into a kind of stop –go policy.  We will have pushed the 
economy so far it will have become overheated , and we will then hav e to tighten policy more 
abruptly than we ’d like.  And instead of having slow , steady growth , improvement in the labor 
market , and continued improvement and good performance in the labor market, I don ’t think it ’s 
good policy to have to then slam on the br akes and risk a downturn in the economy.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby with Dow Jones Newswires.  One of your colleagues 
in the dot plots  said they’d like to see negative interest rates —didn’t expect to see that.  What do 
you make of negative interest rates as a potential  source of new stimulus if the F ed were to have 
to do something more, you know, as o pposed to  maybe  going to QE ?  Does negative interest 
rates have any part —does it —is it—should it be part of the F ed’s toolkit , essentially?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So, let me be clear that negative interest rates was not something that 
we considered very seriously at all today.  It’s—was not one of our main policy options.  But one 
participant in the Committee would like to see additional accommodation , is concerned by the 
inflation outlook , and thin ks that we need additional stimulus, additional accommodation to 
provide that , and propose d doing so by moving interest rates negative.  That’s something we ’ve 
seen in several European countries.  It’s not something we talked  about today.  Look , if—I don ’t 
expect that we ’re going to be in a path of providing additional accommodation , but if the outlook 
were to change in a way that most of my colleagues and I do not expect and we found ourselves 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 18 of 23 
 with a weak economy that needed additional stimulus, we would look at all of our available 
tools , and that would be something that we would evaluate in that kind of context.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.  In July, when you were 
talking to us , you said that you yourself expected to see the first rate hike before the end of the 
year.  Is that still your expectation?  And also, when you talked about the developments in 
financial markets and what caused the August turbulence —you mentioned China and  other 
things —you did  mention the prospects of a Fed rate increase.  Do you think that played a role as 
well?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So you ask me about my own expectation , and I ’d say —I don ’t want 
to—I speak on behalf of the Committee and try to explain Committee  decisions , and we don ’t 
identify who ’s who in terms of our projections of the funds rate , and I don ’t want to change that 
and have the focus be on my personal views on the path.  You know, I have characterized the 
Committee view as , you know, a forecast  that will likely, if it prevails, if that ’s how the economy 
evolves, call for a funds rate increase later this year.  And I think that ’s a fair summary of the 
Committee ’s assessment of things.  You asked me, I think, also about uncertainty about our own 
policies?  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Well, no, not uncertainty , just the fact that the market 
turbulence —a lot of people in August said part  of that was a concern about the F ed was about to 
raise interest rates, and you did n’t mention that as one reason for the turbulence.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think the main drivers of the turbulence have been concerns 
about the global outlook, that ’s how I read it .  But I know that, of cour se, there is uncertainty 
about F ed policy.  As I mentio ned, we ’re well aware that there ’s been a huge focus on the 
decision today.   And, you know, I would  ask you to appreciat e that there are a lot of cross -
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 19 of 23 
 currents in economic and financial developments that we need to take into account in deciding 
on what th e appropriate course of policy is.  
And we don ’t make continuous decisions every single day about our policy , we meet 
periodically.  We do our darndest to pull together the best analysis we can and to exchange views 
and to arrive at Committee decisions.  I do understand that , during this intermeeting pe riod, that 
every word that an FOM C member has said has been parsed for its potential implications for 
what our decision will be.  I think it ’s, you know —that’s an unfortunate state of affairs, but I 
understand , and I think it ’s natural when you ’re at a point when conditions may  be falling in 
place for there to be a shift in policy.   It’s natural that that should happen , and it does,  to some 
extent , contribute to uncertainty in financial markets.  
MICHELLE FLEURY .  Hi, Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  You talked a lot about the 
strong dollar.   I wondered, do you see your policy actions affecting the dollar?  Is it something 
you consider when you are making your policy decisions?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, monetary policy —U.S. monetary policy is directed toward trying 
to achieve the goals the Congress has laid out for us.  When we —when monetary policy tightens 
and interest rates rise, it commonly is the case , either when it happens or in expectation —the 
expectation that that ’s coming —interest rate differentials globally do tend to reduce  capital flows 
that have impacts on exchange rates .1  So monetary policy often has some effect on the exchange 
rate, and it ’s not , in my view , the main channel by which monetary policy works.  It’s one of a 
number of different channels by which monetary policy works , but it does have some impact on 
exchange rates , and, of course, yes, we need to take that into account.  
                                                 
1 Chair Yellen intended to say that “interest rate differentials globally do tend to  induce  capital flows that have 
impacts on exchange rates.”

 GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I want to see if you would shift gears  a 
little bit and talk about the housing market.  You say in the statement , the housing market has 
improved .  How much are you counting on the housing market for growth going forward , 
especially since the Committee sees rates rising?  Thanks.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we are envisioning further improvements in the housing market.  
It remains ver y depressed —housing starts bel ow levels that seem consistent with underlying 
demographics, especially in an economy that ’s creating jobs , and we have lots of pe ople who are 
still doubled up , and demand for housing should be there and should materialize as the job 
market improves and income growth improves.   So, are we counting on it?  Housing is now a 
very small sector of the economy.   It is not the driver of —it is not the key driver in my own 
forecast of ongoing improvements in the U .S. economy.   It plays a supporting role , but consumer 
spending is the main driver , bolstered by, you know, a decent outlook for investment spending.  
But I would continue to expect h ousing to improve.  And, remember, we ’re envisioning , if things 
go as we anticipate , a pretty gra dual path of increases in short -term interest rates over time.  To 
some extent , that’s already embodied in longer term rates.  On the other hand , as time passe s and 
we move beyond the window in which short rates are zero, it will be natural for long rates to rise 
some.  And, of course , we recognize that the housing market is sensitive to mortgage rate s.  It’s 
a—it is an important factor.   But that ’s something that, of course , we are taking into account in  
thinking about what ’s the appropriate path of policy.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  You 
mentioned you ’ve gotten a lot of unsolicited advice —the folks outside.  But there is another side 
that says the F ed should raise interest rates because keeping rates so long —so low for so long 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 21 of 23 
 has actually exacerbated th e wealth gap.  Do you think the F ed has widened the wealth gap with 
its low interest rate policy?  These people say low i nterest rates mainly benefit the wealthy.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I guess I really don ’t see it that way.  It is true that interest rates 
affect asset prices , but they have a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities and 
assets.  To me , the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to 
work.  And since income inequality is surely exacerbated by a high —having high unemployment 
and a weak job market that has the most profound negative effects on the most vulne rable 
individuals, to me, putting people back to work and seeing a strengthening of the labor market 
that has a disproportionately favorable effect on vulnerable portions of our population, that ’s not 
something that increases income inequality.  
There have been a number of studies that have done —been done recently that have tried 
to take account of many different ways in which monetary policy , acting through different parts 
of the transmission mechanism , affect inequality.   And there ’s a lot of guesswork inv olved , and 
different analyse s can come up with different things.  But a pretty recent paper that ’s quite 
comprehensive concludes that Fed policy has not exacerbated income inequality.  
JON PRIOR.   Thanks.  What —I’m Jon Prior with Politico .  What role did a possible 
government shutdown this year play in your decision today to delay the rate hike , and what 
would you say to lawmakers who are pursuing th is strategy yet again?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, it played absolutely no role in our decision.  I believe it ’s the 
responsibility of Congress to pass a budget, to fund the government, to deal with a debt ceiling 
so that America pays its bills.  We have a good recovery in place that ’s really making progress , 
and to see Congress take actions that would en danger that progress —I think that would be more 
than unfortunate.  So, to me , that’s Congress ’s job.  Congress charged us with forming an 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 22 of 23 
 economic outloo k that is focused on the medium  term and taking appropriate policy actions 
based on that outlook , and t hat’s what we have done in the past and will continue to do going 
forward.  
STEVE BECKNER.  Madam Chair, Steve Beckner of MNI.  You said in y our opening 
statement that the F ed’s policy of maintaining a large balance sheet —by not starting to shrink 
that bala nce sheet by curtailing reinvestments and rollovers —that helps add to your 
accommodative monetary stance on top of the near -zero federal funds rate.  By delaying rate 
hikes, logically , are you not also delaying reducing the balance sheet?  A year ago, the FOMC 
said it would not start shrinking the balance sheet and still it ’s—until it started raising the funds 
rate.  So is it a concern that you are delaying normalization of the balance sheet ?  W as that an 
issue that you and your colleagues discussed?  Thank  you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  We have been —and this was reported in the minutes of our July 
meeting —we have been discussing reinvestment policy.  Our normalization principles indicated 
that we would not begin to either reduce or eliminate reinvestments until after we have begun to 
raise the federal funds rate.  Our principles said that the exact timing of that would depend on 
economic and financial conditions and our evaluation of them, and that guidance continues to be 
accurate —we don ’t have anything further on it .  But it is certainly true that we have committed 
to wait to begin running down our balance sheet until after we ’ve begun the process of 
normalization.  So, yes, if we defer, this is not a very large matter that we ’re talking about from a 
stimulus point of  view .  But it is , to some extent , true that if we delay raising the rate, it 
probably —maybe delays the timing at which that process  will begin.  But there ’s no fixed —
we’ve not given some fixed amount of time at so many months after we start .  And we ’re 
 September 17, 2015  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINA L 
 
Page 23 of 23 
 continuing to discuss what the appropriate timing would be of that policy and haven ’t made any 
further decisions on that just yet.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference 
December 16, 2015 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.   Good afternoon.  Earlier today, t he Federal Open Market Committ ee 
decided to raise the target rang e for the federal funds rate by  ¼ percentage point , bringing it to 
¼ to ½ percent. 
This action marks the end of an e xtraordinary seven-year period  during which the federal 
funds rate was held near zero to s upport the recovery of the ec onomy from the worst financial 
crisis and recession since the G reat Depression.  It also recog nizes the considerable progress that 
has been made toward restoring jobs, raising incomes, and easin g the economic hardship of 
millions of Americans.  And it refl ects the Committee’s confide nce that the economy will 
continue to strengthen.  The econom ic recovery has clearly come  a long way, although it is not 
yet complete.  Room for further improvement in the labor market  remains, and inflation 
continues to run below our longer-run objective.  But with the economy performing well and 
expected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a mode st increase in the federal funds 
rate target is now appropriate, r ecognizing that  even after thi s increase, monetary policy remains 
accommodative.  As I will explain, the process of normalizing i nterest rates is likely to proceed 
gradually, although future policy actions will obviously depend  on how the economy evolves 
relative to our objec tives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.   
Since March, the Committee has stated that it would raise the t arget range for the federal 
funds rate when it had seen furth er improvement in the labor ma rket and was reasonably 
confident that infla tion would move back t o its 2 percent objec tive over the medium term.  In our 
judgment, these two criteri a have now been satisfied.  
The labor market has clearly show n significant further improvem ent toward our objective 
of maximum employment.  So far  this year, a total of 2.3 millio n jobs have been added to the 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 2 of 26 
 economy, and over the most recent three months, job gains have averaged an estimated 218,000 
per month, similar to the avera ge pace since the beginning of t he year.  The unemployment rate, 
at 5 percent in November, is dow n 0.6 percentage point from the  end of last year and is close to 
the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run no rmal level.  A broader measure 
of unemployment that includes i ndividuals who want and are avai lable to work but have not 
actively searched recently and pe ople who are working part time  but would rather work full time 
also has shown solid improvement .  That said, some cyclical wea kness likely remains:  The labor 
force participation rate is st ill below estimates of its demogr aphic trend, involuntary part-time 
employment remains somewhat el evated, and wage growth has yet t o show a sustained pickup.  
The improvement in employment conditions this year has occurred  amid continued 
expansion in economic activit y.  U.S. real gross domestic produ ct is estimated to have increased 
at an average pace of 2¼ percent ove r the first three quarters of the year.  Net exports have been 
restrained by subdued foreign grow th and the appreciation of th e dollar, but this weakness has 
been offset by solid expansion of domestic spending.  Continued  job gains and increases in real 
disposable income have suppor ted household spending, and purcha ses of new motor vehicles 
have been particularly strong.  Res idential investment has been  rising at a faster pace than last 
year, although the level of new  homebuilding still remains low.   And outside of the drilling and 
mining sector, where lower oil pric es have led to substantial c uts in investment outlays, business 
investment has posted solid gains.   
The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a  moderate pace and labor market 
indicators will continue to strengthen.  Although developments abroad still pose risks to U.S. 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 3 of 26 
 economic growth, these risks app ear to have lessened since last  summer.  Overall, the Committee 
sees the risks to the outlook f or both economic activity and th e labor market as balanced.  
The anticipation of ongoing economic  growth and additional impr ovement in labor 
market conditions is an importa nt factor underp inning the Commi ttee’s confidence that inflation 
will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  O verall consumer price inflation—
as measured by the price index for personal consumption expendi tures—was only ¼ percent over 
the 12 months ending in October.  However, much of the shortfal l from our 2 percent objective 
reflected the sharp declines in e nergy prices since the middle of last year, and the effects of these 
declines should dissip ate over time.  The appreciation of the d ollar has also weighed on inflation 
by holding down import prices.  As th ese transitory influences fade and as the labor market 
strengthens further, the Committ ee expects inflation to rise to  2 percent over the medium term.   
The Committee’s confidence in  the inflation outlook rests impor tantly on its judgment 
that longer-run inflation expecta tions remain well anchored.  I n this regard, although some 
survey measures of longer-run in flation expectations have edged  down, overall they have been 
reasonably stable.  Market-base d measures of inflation compensa tion remain near historically 
low levels, although the declines i n these measures over the pa st year and a half may reflect 
changes in risk and liquidity pr emiums rather than an outright decline in inflati on expectations.  
Our statement emphasizes that , in considering future policy dec isions, we will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progre ss toward our inflation goal.  
This general assessment of the  outlook is reflected in the indi vidual economic projections 
submitted for this meeting by FOMC participants.  As always, ea ch participant’s projections are 
conditioned on his or her own view  of appropriate monetary poli cy.  Participants’ p rojections for 
real GDP growth are little cha nged from the projections made in  conjunction with the September 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 4 of 26 
 FOMC meeting.  The median projec tion for real GDP growth is 2.1  percent for this year and 
rises to 2.4 percent in 2016, somew hat above the median estimat e of the longer-run normal 
growth rate.  Thereafter, the  median growth projection declines  toward its longer-run rate.  The 
median projection for the unemploym ent rate in the fourth quart er of this year stands at 
5 percent, close to the median estimate of the longer-run norma l unemployment rate.  Committee 
participants generally see the  unemployment rate declining a li ttle further next year and then 
leveling out.  The path of the med ian unemployment rate is slig htly lower than in September, and 
while the median longer-run normal  unemployment rate has not ch anged, some participants 
edged down their estimates.  Final ly, FOMC participants project  inflation to be very low this 
year, largely reflecting lower  prices for energy and non-energy  imports.  As the transitory factors 
holding down inflation abate and labor market conditions contin ue to strengthen, the median 
inflation projection rises fro m just 0.4 percent this year to 1 .6 percent next year and reaches 
1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in  2018.  The path of the med ian inflation projec tions is little 
changed from September.  
With inflation currently still lo w, why is the Committee raisin g the federal funds rate 
target?  As I have already note d, much of the recent softness i n inflation is due to transitory 
factors that we expect to abat e over time, and diminishing slac k in labor and product markets 
should put upward pressure on inf lation as well.  In addition, we recognize that it takes time for 
monetary policy actions to affect  future economic outcomes.  We re the FOMC to delay the start 
of policy normalization for t oo long, we would likely end up ha ving to tighten policy relatively 
abruptly at some point to keep t he economy from overheating and  inflation from significantly 
overshooting our objective.  Such a n abrupt tightening could in crease the risk of pushing the 
economy into recession.   
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 5 of 26 
 As I have often noted, the importa nce of our initial increase i n the target range for the 
federal funds rate should not be  overstated:  Even after today’ s increase, the stance of monetary 
policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improv ement in labor market 
conditions and a return to 2 percen t inflation.  As we indicate d in our statement, “the Committee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant only gradual 
increases in the federal funds rat e; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below 
levels that are expected t o prevail in the longer run.”  
This expectation is consistent w ith the view that the neutral n ominal federal funds rate—
defined as the value of the fed eral funds rate that would be ne ither expansionary nor 
contractionary if the econom y were operating near potential—is currently low by historical 
standards and is likel y to rise only gradua lly over time.  One indication that the neutral funds rate 
is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been only mod erate in recent years despite the 
very low level of the federal f unds rate and the Federal Reserv e’s very large holdings of longer-
term securities.  Had the neutral  rate been running closer to i ts longer-run level, these policy 
actions would have been expected to foster a much more rapid ec onomic expansion.  
The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate may be par tially attributable to a 
range of persistent economic h eadwinds that have weighed on agg regate demand.  Following the 
financial crisis, these headwinds  included tighter underwriting  standards and lim ited access to 
credit for some borrowers, de leveraging by many households to r educe debt burdens, 
contractionary fiscal policy, w eak growth abroad coupled with a  significant appreciation of the 
dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevate d uncertainty about the economic 
outlook.  Although the restraint imp osed by many of these facto rs has declined noticeably over 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 6 of 26 
 the past few years, some of the se effects have remained signifi cant.  As these effects abate, the 
neutral federal funds rate s hould gradually move higher over ti me.   
This view is implicitly reflected in participants’ projections of appropriate monetary 
policy.  The median projection for t he federal funds rate rises  gradually to nearly 1½ percent in 
late 2016 and 2½ percent in late 201 7.  As the factors restrain ing economic growth continue to 
fade over time, the median rate rises to 3¼ percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run 
normal level.  Compared with the p rojections made in September,  a number of participants 
lowered somewhat their paths for the federal funds rate, althou gh changes to the median path are 
fairly minor.  
I’d like to underscore that the forecasts of the appropriate pa th of the federal funds rate, 
as usual, are conditional on partic ipants’ individual projectio ns of the most likely outcomes for 
economic growth, employment and i nflation, and other factors.  However, the actual path of the 
federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as infor med by incoming data.  Stronger 
growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the 
neutral federal funds rate was rising more quickly than expecte d, making it appropriate to raise 
the federal funds rate more quick ly as well.  Conversely, if th e economy were to disappoint, the 
federal funds rate would likely rise more slowly.  
The Committee will continue i ts policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing Treasury 
securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.  As 
highlighted in our policy statemen t, we anticipate continuing t his policy “until normalization of 
the level of the federal funds  rate is well under way.”  Mainta ining our sizable holdings of 
longer-term securities should help maintain accommodative finan cial conditions and should 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 7 of 26 
 reduce the risk that the federa l funds rate might return to the  effective lower bound in the event 
of future adverse shocks.  
Finally, in conjunction with our pol icy statement, we also rele ased an implementation 
note that provides details on the  tools that we are using to ra ise the federal funds rate into the 
new target range.  Specifically, the Board of Gov ernors raised the interest rate paid on required 
and excess reserves to ½ percent , and the FOMC authorized overn ight reverse repurchase 
operations at an offering rate  of ¼ percent.  Both of these cha nges will be effective tomorrow.  
To ensure sufficient monetary c ontrol at the onset of the norma lization process, we have, for the 
time being, suspended the aggreg ate cap on overnight reverse re purchase transactions that has 
been in place during the test ing phase of this facility.  Recal l that the Committ ee intends to phase 
out this facility when it is no l onger needed to help control t he federal funds rate.  The Board of 
Governors also approved a ¼ percen tage point increase in the di scount rate for primary credit to 
1 percent.  
Based on the extensive testing of  our policy tools in recent ye ars, the Committee is 
confident that the normalization process will proceed smoothly.   Nonetheless, as part of prudent 
contingency planning, we will be monitoring financial market de velopments closely in the 
coming days and are prepared to make adjustments to our tools i f that proves necessary to 
maintain appropriate control  over money market rates. 
Thank you.  I will be happy to take your questions.  MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsi nger with the Associated Press.   I guess the word 
is “finally.”  The—we have a sked you for so long, “Why were you  delaying?  Why were you 
delaying?”  So, I’ll ask, given de velopments around the world t hat still—there is still weakness, 
and the inflation is still nowhere near your target.  What made  you say “Do it now”?  Some have 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 8 of 26 
 said it was because you feared a lack of credibility if you did n’t move.  Did that play a role in 
your decision?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  We decided to move a t this time because we feel the conditions that 
we set out for a move—namely, furth er improvement in the labor market and reasonable 
confidence that inflation woul d move back to 2 percent over the  medium term—we felt that 
these conditions had been satis fied.  We have been concerned, a s you know, about the risks from 
the global economy, and those risk s persist, but the U.S. econo my has shown considerable 
strength.  Domestic spending that accounts for 85 percent of ag gregate spending in the U.S. 
economy has continued to hold up.  It’s grown at a solid pace.  And while there is a drag from 
net exports, from relatively wea k growth abroad, and the apprec iation of the dollar, overall, we 
decided today that the risks t o the outlook for the labor marke t and the economy are balanced.  
And we recognize that monetary po licy operates with lags.  We w ould like to be able to 
move in a prudent and, as we’ve em phasized, gradual manner.  It ’s been a long time since the 
Federal Reserve has raised inter est rates, and I think it’s pru dent to be able to watch what the 
impact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion 
enables us to do this.  
Again, I think it’s important not  to overblow the significance of this first move.  It’s only 
25 basis points.  It—monetary policy remains accommodative.  We  have indicated that we will 
be watching what happens very c arefully in the economy in terms  of our actual and forecast—
our projected conditions relative to our employment and inflati on goals and will adjust policy 
over time as seems appropriate t o achieve those goals.  Our exp ectation, as I’ve indicated, is that 
policy adjustments will be gradual over time, but, of course, t hey will be informed by the 
outlook, which in turn will ev olve with incoming data.

 STEVE LIESMAN.  Madam Chair , thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Under the old 
regime, before you were raising r ates, it was easy to understan d within your mandate what you 
wanted to do.  You wanted the unempl oyment rate to fall, you wa nted inflation to rise, and it was 
easy for the public to judge the  success or failure of your pol icy.  Could you explain under the 
new regime what you’re looking for?  Do you want the unemployme nt rate to stop falling?  Do 
you want it to rise?  And what i s it you hope for from inflatio n, which I think is a little more 
understandable, or is “neutral ” itself now a policy goal?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  “Neutral” is not a policy goal.  It is an assess ment.  It’s a benchmark 
that I think is usual—is usefu l for assessing the stance of pol icy.  Neutral is essentially a stance 
of policy, a level of short-term r ates, which, if the economy w ere operating near  its potential—
and we’re reasonably not quite a t that, but reasonably close to  it—it would be a level that would 
maintain or sustain those condi tions.  So, at this point, polic y we judge to be accommodative.  
The Committee forecasts that the  unemployment rate will continu e to decline, and I think that’s 
important and appropriate for tw o reasons.  First of all, as I’ ve indicated, I continue to judge that 
there remains slack in the econom y, margins of slack that are n ot reflected in the standard 
unemployment rate, and, in partic ular, I’ve pointed to the depr essed level of labor force 
participation and also the somewhat abnormally high level of pa rt-time employment.  So a 
further decline in the unemploy ment rate and strengthening of l abor market conditions will help 
to erode those margins of slac k.  But also we want to see infla tion move up back to our 2 percent 
objective over the medium term , and so seeing above-trend growt h and continuing tightness—
greater tightness in labor and pr oduct markets—I think that wil l help us achieve our objective as 
well with respect to inflation.

Page 10 of 26 
 STEVE LIESMAN.  Just to follo w up, how does raising rates help get you to either of 
those goals?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  We have kept rates  at an extremely low level and  had a high balance 
sheet for a very long time.  We ha ve considered the risks to th e outlook and worried about the 
fact that with interest rates at zero, we have less scope to re spond to negative shocks than to 
positive shocks that would call for a tightening of policy.  Th at is a factor that has induced us to 
hold rates at zero for this long.  B ut we recognize that policy  is accommodative, and if we do not 
begin to slightly reduce the amount of accommodation, the odds are good that the economy 
would end up overshooting both our employment and inflation obj ectives.  What I—we would 
like to avoid is a situation whe re we have waited so long that we’re forced to tighten policy 
abruptly, which risks aborting w hat I would like to see as a ve ry long-running and sustainable 
expansion.  So to keep the econom y moving along the growth path  it’s on with improving and 
solid conditions in labor marke ts, we would like to avoid a sit uation where we have left so much 
accommodation in place for so long that we overshoot these obje ctives and then have to tighten 
abruptly and risk damaging—damaging that performance.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Chair Yelle n, Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  In the 
sentence in your statement about g radual increases, in that sec tion, the Committee says that it 
“will carefully monitor” progress—actual and expected progress on inflation.  That’s going to 
read like some kind of code to a l ot of people on Wall Street.  Can you describe—what do you 
mean when you say “carefully mon itor”?  And, speci fically, with  regard to what you do next, do 
you need to see inflation actuall y rise at this point in order to raise interest rates again?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we recogni ze that inflati on is well below our 2 percent goal.  
The entire Committee is comm itted to achieving our 2 percent in flation objective over the 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 11 of 26 
 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’ t persist at levels above our 
2 percent objective.  The Comm ittee is equally committed—this i s a symmetric goal—and the 
Committee is equally committed t o not allowing inflation to per sist below our 2 percent 
objective.  
Now, I’ve tried to explain—and many of my colleagues have as we ll—why we have 
reasonable confidence that inf lation will move up over time, an d the Committee declared it had 
reasonable confidence.  Nevertheless, that is a forecast, and w e really need to monitor over time 
actual inflation performance to m ake sure that it is conforming , it is evolving, in the manner that 
we expect.  So it doesn’t mean t hat we need to see inflation re ach 2 percent before moving again, 
but we have expectations for how  inflation will behave.  And we re we to find that the underlying 
theory is not bearing out, tha t it is not behaving in the manne r that we expect, and that it doesn’t 
look like the shortfall is tra nsitory and disappearing with tig hter labor markets, that would 
certainly give us pause.  
And we have indicated that we’ re reasonably close—not quite the re, but reasonably 
close—to achieving our maximum em ployment objective, but we hav e a significant shortfall on 
inflation.  And so we’re calling a ttention to the importance of  verifying our—that things evolve 
in line with our forecasts. 
JON HILSENRATH.  Just to fo llow up, do you need to see it rise?   Not necessarily get to 
the 2 percent goal, but in orde r to move again, do you want to see inflation measures actually 
moving higher?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m not going to gi ve you a simple formula for w hat we need to see 
on the inflation front in order t o raise rates again.  We’ll al so be looking at the path of 
employment as well as the pat h for inflation.  But if incoming data were—led us to call into 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 12 of 26 
 question the inflation forecast that we have set out, and that could be a variety of different kinds 
of evidence, that would certainly give the Committee pause.  Bu t I don’t want to say there’s a 
simple benchmark.  We—you know, the C ommittee expects inflation —over the next year, the 
median expectation is for in flation to be running about 1.6 per cent, and—both core and headline.  
So we do expect it to be moving up, but we don’t expect it to r each 2 percent.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Madam Chair, C raig Torres from Bloomberg.  I ’d like to follow 
Jon’s question.  The way the Com mittee describes inflation—well , there’s this “transitory” 
language.  I’d like to point out tha t oil prices today are at 3 6, and on June 15, they were $60.  So, 
this “transitory,” which first  appeared in the statement in Dec ember, I believe, is lasting a long, 
long time, maybe longer than ma ny people’s definition of “trans itory,” and it could go on.  And, 
second, I really wonder if the Committee knows how quickly wage  increases or labor market 
tightness transfers into higher  prices, and that too is also a forecast.  So, my question:  What will 
you be willing to do if you don’t see  progress toward 2 percent  inflation?  We missed the target 
for three years, and, you know, w hat would you be willing to do ?  And, second, would you allow 
inflation to bounce around betw een 2 and 3 percent the way you’ ve allowed it to move under 
2 percent over the past several years?  Thanks.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  First, let me say w ith respect to oil prices, I have been surprised by 
the further downward movement  in oil prices, but we do not need  to see oil prices rebound to 
higher levels in order for the impact on inflation to wash out.   So all they need to do is stabilize.  
I believe there is some limit  below which oil prices are unlike ly to rise.  If we look—to fall.  If 
we look at market expectations, mar ket expectations are for sta bilization and then some gradual 
upward movement.  So I certainly g rant that we’ve had a series of shocks pushing them down, 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 13 of 26 
 but we’re not looking for them t o revert back to the—to higher levels that they were at merely to 
stabilize. 
We—I would point out, you asked me , would we tolerate overshoot s.  For a number of 
years between 2004 and 2008, we had a s eries of increases in oi l prices that for a series of years 
raised inflation above—again, we  didn’t have a 2 percent object ive then, but—raised it above 
2 percent, and we judged those incr eases to be transitory as we ll and looked through them.  We 
do monitor inflation expectations  very carefully.  If we saw in  a meaningful way that inflation 
expectations were either movi ng up in a way that made it—them s eem unanchored or down, that 
would be of concern.  And we have called attention to some slig ht downward movements in 
survey measures.  We are watchi ng that, but I still judge that inflation expectations are 
reasonably well anchored.  So, yes , we have tolerated inflation  shortfalls that we thought would 
disappear over the medium term j ust as we did overshoots of inf lation that we also judged to be 
transitory.  But we do need to mon itor inflation very carefully  because if energy prices and the 
dollar were to stabilize, impor t prices, our expectation is tha t both headline and core inflation 
would move up.  And if we failed t o see that occurring in the m anner that we expect, of course 
we need to take further action to reconsider the outlook and to  put in place appropriate policy.  
CRAIG TORRES.  What woul d that action look like?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you know, if the economy were disappointin g, we—you know, 
our actions wouldn’t purely be  based on inflatio n, we would als o take employment into account.  
So I can’t give you a simple an swer, but we would pursue a more  accommodative policy because 
we do—certainly are committed to achieving 2 percent over the m edium term.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  Bill Dudley has 
talked about the need for the F ed to adjust policy based on the  responsiveness of financial 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 14 of 26 
 markets as you begin to increase rates.  You didn’t talk about that today.  Is it a point that you 
agree with?  And, if so, what is  it that you’re looking for?  H ow will you judge whether financial 
markets are accepting and transmitting these changes?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, there are num ber of different channels thr ough which monetary 
policy is transmitted to spending decisions.  The behavior of l onger-term—longer-term interest 
rates, short-term interest rate s matter.  The value of asset pr ices and the exchange rate, also—
these are transmission channels.  We wouldn’t be focused on sho rt-term financial volatility, but 
were there unanticipat ed changes in financi al conditions that w ere persistent and we judged to 
affect the outlook, we would of cour se have to take those into account.  So we will watch 
financial developments, but what we’re looking at here is the l onger-term economic outlook:  
Are we seeing persistent changes in financial market conditions  that would have a bearing, a 
significant bearing, on the outlook that we would need to take account in formulating appropriate 
policy?  Yes, we would, but it’s  not short-term volatility in m arkets.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  In part, what I was attempting to say is, if you didn’t see 
changes, you would be concerned a nd have to move more, quickly.   Are you concerned that if 
markets don’t tighten suffici ently you may need to do more?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, look, you know, w e—this is not an unantici pated policy move, 
and we have been trying to expl ain what our policy strategy is.   So it’s not as though I’m 
expecting to see a marked, immed iate reaction in financial mark ets.  Expectations about Fed 
policy have been built into the str ucture of financial market p rices, but we obviously will track 
carefully the behavior of both s hort- and longer-term interest rates, the dollar, and asset prices, 
and if they move in persistent a nd significant ways that are ou t of line with the expectations that 
we have, then of course we will take those into account.

 REBECCA JARVIS.  Thank you.  Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  Histori cally, most 
economic expansions fade after this long.  How confident are yo u that our economy won’t slip 
back into recession in the near term?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start b y saying that I feel confident about the fundamentals 
driving the U.S. economy, the  health of U.S. households, and do mestic spending.  There are 
pressures on some sectors of the  economy, particularly manufact uring and the energy sector, 
reflecting global developments and developments in commodity ma rkets and energy markets, but 
the underlying health of the U.S . economy I consider to be quit e sound.  I think it’ s a myth that 
expansions die of old age.  I do not  think that they die of old  age.  So the fact that this has been 
quite a long expansion doesn’t l ead me to believe that it’s one  that has—its days are numbered.  
But the economy does get hit  by shocks, and there are both posi tive shocks and negative shocks.  
And so there is a significan t odd, you know, probability in any  year that the economy will suffer 
some shock that we don’t know about  that will put it into reces sion.  And so I’m not sure exactly 
how high that probability is i n any year, but maybe at least on  the order of 10 percent.  So, yes, 
there is some probability tha t that could happen, and of course  we’d appropriately respond, but it 
isn’t something that is fated to happen because we’ve had a lon g expansion, and I don’t see 
anything in the underlying stren gth of the economy that would l ead me to be concerned about 
that outcome.  
REBECCA JARVIS.  In the event of  an outcome like that, in the m ost negative of 
scenarios, are there other polic y measures outside of interest rates, outside of traditional 
quantitative easing, that you ins ide of the Fed have discussed and contemplated for another 
environment like something whic h we saw throughout the Great Re cession?  Have you talked 
about anything that would be mor e direct to the economy?  
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 16 of 26 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, during the years in which we were—you know , the economy 
was recovering from the Great R ecession and we put further poli cy and measures in place, we 
studied our policy op tions quite carefully.  As you know, commu nications policy to affect market 
expectations about the path of int erest rates played an importa nt role.  That’s something we did 
in conjunction with asset purchases .  Obviously, we lowered our  overnight interest rate 
effectively to zero.  Now, we have  seen some foreign central ba nks, Europe—the ECB and 
others—that have taken their ove rnight rate int o negative terri tory, and that’s something that—I 
don’t contemplate that we will need to do this, but it is somet hing that we could study.  Of 
course, we have balance sheet po licies, and there might be a ra nge of direct polic ies that we 
could use as well.  But this is  something that we have thought about, our range of options.  
SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  Could I ask 
about the balance sheet policy you ’re adopting today?  You’ve s aid that you want to keep a large 
balance sheet until normaliza tion is “well under way.”  Could y ou explain first of all why you 
anticipate that being appropriate?  What does “well under way” mean in terms of normalization?  
And, longer term, what are your view s on the idea that the Fed might need to have a larger 
balance sheet tha n historically over t he longer term?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, in our normali zation principles, which are  in effect, the 
Committee stated that we eventua lly want to operate with a much  smaller balance sheet of—than 
we have at present.  The—we woul d reduce the size of the balanc e sheet to essentially whatever 
size we needed to manage moneta ry policy effective—in an effect ive and efficient way.  Now, a 
lot has changed since pre–financia l crisis in term s of the fina ncial system, and we are studying—
we are engaging in a project at th is time to consider what our long-run operating framework 
should look like.  So I can’t te ll you exactly what size of bal ance sheet we will determine is the 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 17 of 26 
 best to operate in an efficient and effective manner.  It might  be somewhat larger than the very 
tiny quantity of reserves that we had in pre-crisis.  We have n ot determined that.  We have also 
said that we will—we expect to reduce the size of our balance s heet over time by cease—
diminishing or ceasing entir ely reinvestments.  And, beyond tha t, we haven’t given additional 
guidance other than to say tha t the timing of reductions in rei nvestment will depend on economic 
and financial conditions.  And I s uppose the additional guidanc e we’re giving today, when we 
say “well under way,” we want to s ee—as I mentioned, there are number of considerations, and 
the Committee has made no further  decisions about this, but as we’ve discussed, the factors that 
will be relevant to the decision—on e factor that we’ve talked a bout is the desirability of having 
some scope to respond to an adve rse shock to the economy by low ering the federal funds rate.  
And so it would be nice to have a  buffer in terms of having rai sed the federal funds rate to a 
certain extent to give us some meaningful scope to respond.  No w, I don’t have in mind any 
particular level of the feder al funds rate.  It would depend on  the entire economic outlook, how 
robust the economy is.  But that is an important consideration for the Committee, and it means 
that this is not something that we expect to be turning to, to cease reinvestment very quickly.  
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes at Fox Business, ma’am.  On financi al market 
conditions, is there a problem  developing in the high-yield sec tor of the bond market, the junk 
bond sector?  As you know, last week  a mutual fund, Third Avenu e Management, halted 
redemptions so that it wouldn’t have to—because of a sharp sell off in these kinds of bonds.  Are 
you concerned at all, and did you di scuss in the meeting, any r isk to the financial system, a 
systemic risk, because of the conditions in the junk bond marke t?  And, you know, individual 
investors and institutions hol d trillions of dollars of these b onds, which were sold heavily 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 18 of 26 
 because of low rates, and did the  Fed’s low interest rate polic y help lay—sow the seeds for this 
development?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, risk spread s in the high-yield bond market  have been widening 
since last year, partly refl ecting falling oil prices—only part ly, but partly—and redemptions in 
high-yield bond funds have been inc reasing in recent months.  B ut Third Avenue Focused Credit 
Fund was a rather unusual open- end mutual fund.  It had very co ncentrated positions in 
especially risky and illiqui d bonds, and it had been facing ver y significant redemption pressures.  
My understanding is that the SEC i s in touch with Third Avenue.   And, as you probably know, 
the SEC has proposed some reforms to address what’s a structura l problem of liquidity mismatch 
in open-end mutual funds. 
So we continue to believe that f inancial conditions are support ive of economic growth.  
We will be—we have been and will c ontinue to track developments  in financial markets very 
carefully.  I would sa y that I think we have  a far more resilie nt financial system now than we had 
prior to the financial crisis and highly capital[ized] banks th at are well situated to support 
corporate lending.  
I’d also point out that many corpor ations during these years ha ve reduced their interest 
payments and extended their de bt profiles, and I think that sho uld help to mitigate spillovers, but 
we will be evaluati ng this carefully.  
YLAN MUI.  Hi, Ylan from the Washington Post .  You said earlier that expansions don’t 
die of old age, but I think the ot her half of that is that it’s  often central banks that kill them off 
instead.  So I’m wondering how worried you are about the possib ility that the Fed will have to 
turn around after hiking rates.  O ther central banks that have tried to raise rates have had to do 
just that.  And how damaging you think t hat might be to the Fed ’s credibility?  
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 19 of 26 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So, whe n you say that central banks often kill t hem, I think the usual 
reason that that has been true wh en that has been  true is that central banks have begun too late to 
tighten policy, and they’ve allowe d inflation to get out of con trol.  And at that point, they have 
had to tighten policy very abrupt ly and very substantially, and  it’s caused a downturn, and the 
downturn has served to lower  inflation.  So, if you don’t mind my flipping the question on you, I 
would point out that it is because we don’t want to cause a rec ession through that type of 
dynamic at some future date that it is prudent to begin early a nd gradually. 
Now, it is true that some centr al banks have raised rates and l ater turned around.  Not in 
every case has that reflected a  policy mistake.  Economies are subject to shocks.  Sometimes 
when they have raised rates, it  hasn’t been the wrong thing to do, but conditions have changed in 
a way that they have had to rev erse policy to respond to shocks . 
I’m not denying that there are situations where central banks h ave moved too early.  We 
have considered the risk of that .  We have weighed that risk ca refully in making today’s 
decision.  I don’t believe w e’ll have to do it.  But, look, you  know, as I’ve—as the Committee 
has said, we’re watching economic  developments closely, and we will adjust policy in whatever 
way is necessary to support the attainment of our objectives.  
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times .  You said it’s 
important not to overblow the significance to this first move, but, as you know, there’s been a lot 
of attention paid to it.  Ca n you explain to average Americans what if anything might be different 
in the next few weeks or few mont hs for them because of this in terest rate hike?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think the first —the first thing that Americ ans should realize is 
that the Fed’s decision today ref lects our confidence in the U. S. economy, that we believe we 
have seen substantial improveme nt in labor market conditions, a nd while things may be uneven 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 20 of 26 
 across regions of the country a nd different industrial sectors,  we see an economy that is on a path 
of sustainable improvement.  S o, in thinking about their labor market prospects and their 
financial prospects going forw ard, I hope they will take this d ecision as one that signals the 
FOMC’s confidence that conditions will continue to strengthen a nd job market prospects will be 
good. 
It is a very small move.  It wil l be reflected in some changes in borrowing rates.  Longer-
term interest rates—loans that  are linked to longer-term intere st rates are unlikely to move—to 
move very much.  Some—for example , some corporate loans are lin ked to the prime rate, which 
is likely to move up with the fe d funds rate, and those interes t rates will adjust.  There are some 
consumer borrowing rates, I think c redit card rates, that are l inked to short-term rates that might 
move up slightly.  But, remember, w e have very low rates, and w e have made a very small move.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Madam Chair, John Heltman with American Banker.   How 
concerned are you with interest rate risk in banks now that you ’ve obviously ended the zero-rate 
era and began the 0.25 percent–rate  era?  Is that a factor in d ecisions going forward?  Is it 
something that you’re concerned about?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Interest rate ris k at banks is something that we  have been monitoring 
very carefully for quite a long time.  The community banks and smaller banking organizations 
that we work with—part of our supe rvision has been ensuring tha t they manage appropriately for 
interest rate risk.  And the lar ger banking organizations that are subject to the stress tests and 
capital planning—the scenarios t hat we have presented in each o f the last three years look at their 
ability to withstand what would be  much sharper increases in in terest rates than we’re 
envisioning would happen.  But we want to make sure that if the re were sharper increases—
unlike our expectati ons—that they would be well positioned to h andle it.  And we have 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 21 of 26 
 concluded that—that their capital positions are sufficient for them to weather it.  So this has been 
very much on our minds.  
LINDSAY DUNSMUIR.  Hi, Lindsa y Dunsmuir with Reuters.  You keep  saying that the 
things holding back inflation are t ransitory, and yet every day  there seems to be new impulses 
from outside that look that they  could drive prices lower.  I g uess my question is, if in a year’s 
time inflation remains where i t is today, would you see that as  a defeat for your theory?  And is 
that part of the reason why the la nguage has been upgraded in t he statement to say that you want 
to see actual progress towa rds your 2 percent target? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we have sai d that we will carefully monito r both actual and 
expected progress.  You know, I t hink that standard Fed policy has been to look through shocks 
that are transitory.  Occasionall y, there are sequences of tran sitory shocks.  We have had some 
further declines in energy pr ices, and, you know, as I said pre viously, I do expect there is a 
bottom to that.  I expect we w ill be seeing it.  If we—if we an alyze inflation data and conclude 
that, clearly, transitory inf luences are holding down inflation , I do not want to say that we would 
respond to that.  But if we concl uded that there were structura l factors or that there were a 
problem with our theory or some gl obal deflationary force that were simply persistently holding 
down inflation in a way that was  not transitory —and I don’t wan t to attach any simplistic 
meaning to what we would need to s ee to conclude that in the in flation data, but if we concluded 
that, we certainly would take ac tion to make sure we adjusted p olicy so that we attain our 
2 percent objective.  But we w ould need to feel that what we we re seeing in the data suggested a 
sustained departure from our 2 per cent objective that we really  needed to address.  
GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from Mark etWatch.  There’s been a lot of talk today and a lot 
of discussion about the downside risks facing the economy from,  you know, the global 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 22 of 26 
 environment, but you say in your state ment that the risks are n early balanced.  So should—could 
you talk more about the upside ri sks that you see t o the econom y?  And, just briefly, the—some 
Fed officials have been emphasizi ng lately the median CPIs from  Dallas and Cleveland.  How 
much weight do you put on those measures? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, starting wit h the median CPIs, we look at a range of statistics 
that bear on the inflation outl ook, and the median CPI has been  somewhat more stable and 
running closer to 2 percent than t he PCE, but there is a system atic gap between these two 
measures, and our objective is 2 per cent on the PCE price index , and so there’s no simple 
translation.  We do have a PCE i nflation objective.  Sorry, let ’s see, the other—the upside risks.  
So I—there are upside risks to the economy, and I think, you kn ow, we tend to focus on the 
downside risk.  It’s right to do so.  We want  to be careful abo ut downside risks.  But consumers 
are in much healthier financial condition.  Their income prospe cts have improved.  We see them 
buying a lot of cars.  Housing has  been recovering very slowly,  but the demographics would 
point to considerable upside for  residential investment.  My ma inline forecast is for gradual 
recovery, but there is upside r isk there.  We have seen that th e decline in drilling has been 
depressing investment spending, but  there’s upside risk too.  T he global economy—we tend to 
focus—there are many countries t hat are undergoing very difficu lt adjustments or slowing 
growth, especially with declini ng commodity prices.  But even r ecently, we’ve seen growth in 
emerging markets strengthe n.  And—so it is not only downside ri sks, but, you know, we do pay 
attention to downside risks.  But the Committee said they regar d the risks overall as balanced.  
STEVE BECKNER.  Chair Yellen, Steve Beckner of MNI.  You have o ften said that the 
Fed is going to be data depende nt, but you’ve also said in the past that you want to avoid being 
mechanical.  Now, if the data see m to warrant rate hikes at suc cessive meetings, how will you

 avoid the perception—a market pe rception—that you ’re falling in to a pattern or becoming 
mechanical?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we will tr y to avoid that.  I do want to e mphasize that while we 
have said “gradual,” gradual doe s not mean mechanical, evenly t imed, equally sized interest rate 
changes.  So that is not what the Committee means by it.  My gu ess is that the economy will 
progress in a manner that is not  sufficiently even that we will  decide to make evenly spaced 
hikes.  I recognize we want to do w hat’s appropriate, and I rec ognize that’s a danger.  But I do 
want to assure you that we will be data dependent.  As the outl ook evolves, w e’ll respond 
appropriately.  I strongly doubt that it will mean equally spac ed hikes, and it certainly is not the 
intention of the Committee to fo llow any mechanical formula of that type.  
BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greel ey, Bloomberg.  You just mention ed that it may 
be possible that structural f actors are holding down inflation as well, and the dynamic that’s 
happening in top-line inflation i s happening in core as well.  In September, the median projection 
was revised down.  Again today, t he median projection was revis ed down, and this is happening 
at other central banks as well .  Additionally, markets see much  lower inflation in the future than 
central bank models do.  Within the Fed, how are you adapting y our models to look at what is 
now—seems to be a new reality, a nd what are you learning as you  do that? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, so the reas on—the main reason that we revi sed down our 
projection ever so slightly—it’s  hardly revised f or core inflat ion—is because we have seen 
further appreciation of the dolla r that’s holding down import p rices that spills over into core 
inflation.  I mean, my own estim ation is that core inflation wi ll pick up.  There are various 
idiosyncratic factors that affect  core inflation—for example, n onmarket price increases, which 
are a little bit hard to underst and, have been running at a slo w pace.  There were factors that have 
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 24 of 26 
 been affecting inflation in medi cal care prices that may change  over time.  So there is some 
idiosyncratic factors.  But I pe rsonally don’t think we’re in a  world where inflation is being 
determined in a different way t han it has historically.  I see import prices and energy prices as 
holding down headline but also core, and I do believe it will p ick up.  But as we’ve said, if that 
theory is wrong and we do not see in flation is unfolding in the  way the Committee expects, we 
will make adjustments over time in policy.  
BRENDAN GREELEY.  You have a background as an academic.  Are yo u looking into 
these models to see whether they need to be adapted?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  I mean, we have m any people who are studying inf lation models.  
I’ve, you know, tried to—let me express some humility about the m.  I do not think that they’re 
perfect.  Monetary policy is based on economic forecasts.  Ther e are theories of how the 
economy works that govern many a spects of economic forecasting.   Whether it’s consumer 
spending or residential invest ment or inflation, the underlying  theories are not perfect, and they 
are subject to uncertainty.  And thi s is true in all aspects of  forecasting, which is why we change 
our forecasts and our models.  We throw out models that are per sistently not working.  We’re 
always trying to develop better models.  I’m not aware, I will say, of a different model of 
inflation that would be superior  to the one that we employ.  Bu t we have to verify that inflation is 
moving in the manner that we e xpect, and if it’s not, we need t o adjust policy accordingly. 
JEREMY TORDJMAN.  Hello, Jeremy T ordjman with Agence France-Pre sse, AFP.  Are 
you concerned about the negative im pact that your decision coul d have on the emerging 
markets?  Do you fear it could trigge r some financial turbulenc es abroad that could eventually hit 
the U.S.?  
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 25 of 26 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So we are consta ntly monitoring foreign economic  developments, 
including those in emerging mar kets.  We understand that in the  global economy, with integrated 
product and capital markets, that  our fates are very much linke d, and that the performance of the 
U.S. economy has important spillo vers onto emerging markets and  vice versa.  We have been 
trying very carefully—we’ve made a commitment to emerging marke t policymakers that we 
would do our best to communicate as  clearly as we could about o ur policy intentions to avoid 
spillovers that might result from abrupt or unanticipated polic y moves.  I think this move has 
been expected and well communicat ed—at least, I hope that it ha s.  So I don’t think it’s a 
surprise.  This action takes plac e in the context of a U.S. eco nomy that is doing well and is a 
source of strength to the emer ging markets and other economies around the globe.  And so—that 
is, there can be negative spillovers through capital flows, but  remember, there are also positive 
spillovers from a strong U.S. economy.  My general view is that  many emerging markets are in a 
stronger position than they would have been in the 1990s—for ex ample, that they have stronger 
macroeconomic policies.  They have taken steps to strengthen th eir financial systems and are 
better positioned to deal with thi s.  On the other hand, there are vulnerabilities there, and there 
are countries that have bee n badly affected by declining commod ity prices, so we will monitor 
this very carefully.  But we have taken care to avoid unnecessa ry negative spillovers. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.   Wage 
growth is not quite whe re you would like it to be— 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m sorry, what?  NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER.  Wage gr owth is not quite where you woul d like it to 
be.  How much is that going t o play into your thinking next yea r as you’re trying to decide 
whether to raise interest rates more and when?  
 December 16, 2015 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 26 of 26 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So my expectation i s that in a strengthening lab or market that we 
would see faster wage growth, and I  believe there is, with the 2 percent inflati on objective, space 
for wage growth to be higher th an it’s been.  We may be seeing some incipient signs of faster 
wage growth.  We’ve seen a pic kup in measures of hourly compens ation and some slight firming 
in recent months in average hour ly earnings.  I hesitate to say  that this is a firm trend.  We’ve 
been disappointed in the past.  Wag e growth is not—there are ma ny factors that affect it—it’s 
not definitive in any sense i n determining our policy, but it d oes have a bearing on the inflation 
outlook.  It also has a beari ng on assessing how much slack the re is in the labor market, and I 
think a number of my colleagues looking at the slow pace of wag e growth have—you’ve seen 
that their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate  have come down.  And I think 
that is one of the factors that  has prompted those adjustments.   So, you know, it does affect views 
about just how much slack there i s in the labor market and the inflation outlook.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
March  16, 2016  
 
CHAIR YELLEN .  Good afternoon.  Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided 
to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  Our decision to keep 
this accommodative policy stance reflects both our assessment of the economic outlook and the risks associated with that outlook.  The Committee ’s baseline expectations for economic activity, 
the labor market, and inflation have not changed much since December:  With appropriate monetary policy , we continue to expect moderate economic growth, further labor market 
improvement, and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective in two to three years.  However, global economic  and financial developments continue to pose risks.  Against this backdrop, the 
Committee judged it prudent to maintain the current policy stance at today ’s meeting.  I will 
come back to our policy decision momentarily, but first let me review recent economic 
developments and the outlook. 
The labor market continues to strengthen.  Over the most recent three months, job gains 
averaged nearly 230,000 per month, similar to the pace experienced over the past year.  The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in the f irst two months of the year, about in line with the 
median of FOMC participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level.  A broader measure of 
unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not actively searched recent ly and people who are working part time but would rather work full time 
has continued to improve.  Of note, the labor force participation rate has turned up noticeably since the fall, with more people working or actively looking for work as the prospects f or finding 
jobs have improved.  But there is still room for improvement:  Involuntary part -time employment 
remains somewhat elevated, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup. 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 23  
 The improvement in employment conditions so far this year has occurred as economic 
growth appears to have picked up from the modest pace seen in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate, supported by continued job gains and increases in inflation -adjusted incomes .  In contrast, bus iness investment has been weak, in part 
reflecting further reductions in oil drilling as a result of low oil prices.  Net exports also remain soft as a consequence of subdued foreign growth and the earlier appreciation of the dollar.  Looking ahead, the Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. 
Ongoing economic growth and additional strengthening in l abor market conditions are 
important factors underpinning the inflation outlook.  Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures —stepped up to 1¼ percent 
over the 12 months ending in January, as the sh arp decline in energy prices around the end of 
2014 dropped out of the year -over-year figures.  Core inflation , which excludes energy and food 
prices , has also picked up, although it remains to be seen if this firming will be sustained.  In 
particular, the  earlier declines in energy prices and appreciation of the dollar could well continue 
to weigh on overall consumer prices.  But once these transitory influences fade and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years.  
The Committee ’s inflation outlook rests importantly on its judgment that longer -run 
inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  However, the stability of longer -run 
inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted.  Survey -based measures of longer -run 
inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months , although some remain 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 23  
 near historically low levels.  Market -based measures of inflation compensation also remain low.  
Movements in these indicators reflect many factors and therefore may not provide an accurate 
reading on changes in the inflation expectations that are most relevant for wage and price setting.  Nonetheless, our statement continues to emphasize that, in considering fut ure policy decisions, 
we will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.  
This general assessment of the outlook is reflected in the individual economic projections 
submitted for this meeting by FOMC participants.  As always, each participant ’s projections are 
conditioned on his or own —his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, 
depends on each person’ s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the outlook.  
Participants ’ projections for growth of inflation- adjusted gross domestic product or GDP are just 
a touch lower than the projections made in conjunction with the December FOMC meeting.  The median growth projection edges down from 2.2 percent this year to 2 percent in 2018, in line 
with its estimated longer -run rate.  The median projection for the unemployment rate falls from 
4.7 at the end of this year to 4.5 percent at the end of 2018, somewhat below the median assessment of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  T he median path of the unemployment 
rate is a little lower than in December, in part reflecting a slightly lower median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  Finally, with the transitory factors holding down 
inflation expected to abate and l abor market conditions anticipated to strengthen further, the 
median inflation projection rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018.  The median inflation projection for this year is a little lower than in December, but thereafter the median projections are unchanged.  
Since the turn of the year, concerns about global economic prospects have led to 
increased financial market volatility and somewhat tighter financial conditions in the United 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 23  
 States, although financial con ditions have improved notably more recently.  In addition, 
economic growth abroad appears to be running at a somewhat softer pace than previously 
expected.  These unanticipated developments, however, have not resulted in material changes to the Committee ’s baseline outlook.  One reason for this is that market expectations for the path of 
policy interest rates have moved down, and the accompanying decline in longer -term interest 
rates should help cushion any possible adverse effects on domestic economic acti vity.  Indeed, 
while stock prices have fallen slightly since the December meeting and spreads of investment -
grade corporate bond yields over those on comparable -maturity Treasury securities have risen, 
mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs have move d lower.  Of course, the Committee will 
continue to monitor these developments closely and will adjust the stance of monetary policy as needed to foster our goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
Returning to monetary policy, as I noted earli er, the Committee decided to maintain its 
target range for the federal funds rate.  This decision partly reflects the implications for the U.S. economy of the global economic and financial developments I just mentioned.  In addition, proceeding cautiously in removing policy accommodation at this time will allow us to verify that 
the labor market is continuing to strengthen despite the risks from abroad.  Such caution is appropriate given that short -term interest rates are still near zero, which means that monetary 
policy has greater scope to respond to upside than to downside changes in the outlook.  
As we indicated in our statement, “ the Committee expects that economic conditions will 
evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate ; the federal 
funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”   This expectation is consistent with the view that the neutral nominal federal funds 
rate—defined as the value of the fed eral funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 23  
 contractionary if the economy was operating near potential —is currently low by historical 
standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time.  The low level of the neutral federal 
funds rate may be partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that weigh on aggregate demand, including developments abroad, a subdued pace of household formation, and meager productivity growth.  There is considerable uncertainty regarding the evolution of the neutral funds rate over time.  However, if these headwinds abate, as we expect, the neutral federal funds rate should gradually move higher as well.   
This view is implicitly reflected in participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary 
policy.  The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 0.9 percent late 
this year and 1.9 percent next year.  As the factors restraining economic growth are projected to fade further over time, the median rate rises to 3 percent by t he end of 2018, close to its longer -
run normal level.  Compared with the projections made in December, the median path is about 
½ percentage point lower this year and next; the median longer -run normal federal funds rate has 
been revised down as well.  In other words, most Committee participants now expect that achieving economic outcomes similar to those anticipated in December will likely require a somewhat lower path for policy interest rates than foreseen at that time.   
I would like to underscore, howe ver, that the participants ’ projections for the federal 
funds rate, including the median path, are not a “plan” for future policy.  Policy is not on a preset course.  These forecasts represent participants ’ individual assessments of what appropriate policy  
would be given each person’ s own current projections of the most likely outcomes for economic 
growth, employment, inflation, and other factors.  However, considerable uncertainty attaches to each participant ’s forecasts of economic outcomes.  Hence, their  assessments of appropriate 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 23  
 policy are also uncertain and will change in response to adjustments to the economic outlook and 
associated risks, as was the case between December and now.  
Also, it is important to note that the Committee makes its decisions on  a meeting -by-
meeting basis and does not and need not decide on a likely future path for the federal funds rate.  Indeed, the future path of policy is necessarily uncertain because the economy will surely evolve in unexpected ways.  As we note in our state ment, “ the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.”    
Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities and principal payments from agen cy debt and mortgage -backed securities.  
As highlighted in our policy statement, we anticipate continuing this policy “ until normalization 
of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”   Maintaining our sizable holdings of 
longer -term securitie s should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should 
reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock.  
Thank you, and I ’ll be happy to take your questions. 
STEVE LIESMA N.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.   Madam Chair, as you know, inflation has 
gone up the last two months.  We had another strong jobs report, the tracking forecast s for GDP 
have returned to 2 percent, and yet the Fed stands pat while it ’s in a process of what it said  it 
launched in December was a “ process of normalization.”   So I have two questions about this :  
Does  the F ed have a credibility problem , in the sense that it says it will do some —one thing 
under certain conditions but doesn’ t end up doing it ?  And then, frankly, if the current conditions 
are no t sufficient for the F ed to raise rates, well, what would those conditions ever look like?  
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 23  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, let me start—let me start  with the question of the F ed’s 
credibility , and you used the word “ promises ” in connection with that.  And , as I tried to 
emphasize in my opening statement, the paths that the participants project for the federal funds 
rate and how it will evolve are not a preset plan or commitment or promise of the C ommittee.  
Indeed, they are not even —the median should not be interpreted as a C ommittee -endorsed 
forecast , and there ’s a lot of uncertainty around each participant ’s projection.  And  they will 
evolve —those assessments of appropriate policy are completely contingent on each participant ’s 
forecast of the economy and how economic events will unfold.  And they are, of course, uncertain , and you should fully expect that forecast s for the appropriate path of policy on the part 
of all participants will evolve over time as shocks, positive or negative, hit the economy that alter those forecasts.  So you have seen a shift this time in most participants ’ assessments of the 
appropriate path for policy , and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat 
slower projected path for global growth —for growth in the global economy outside the United 
States —and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.  And 
those changes in financial conditions and in the path of the global economy have induced changes in the assessment of individual participants in what path is appropriate to achieve our objectives.  So that ’s what you see.  That ’s what you see.  
Now, I guess you asked me also what would we need to see to continue raising rates , and 
I think it ’s worth pointing out here that the Committee —most participants do continue to 
envision that if economic developments unfold as they expect , that further increases i n the 
federal funds rate will prove appropriate over time .  Most participants anticipate that, a nd that the 
pace will be gradual.  As I emphasized, most empirical work attempting to assess what the equilibrium level of the fed funds rate is , a level that w ould be neither expansionary nor 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 23  
 contractionary  is—those assessments are quite low at this time.  So there is accommodation in 
the stance of policy , and we do expect , over time , that neutral rate to move up, but, you know, 
we’re not positive what rate —what  the pace of change of that will be over time.  But , given that 
the economy is now close to our maximum employment objective, you know, hopefully inflation 
is moving up— I  mentioned, as you mentioned, recent readings on inflation have moved up.  
There may be some— you know, I want to warn that there may be some transitory factors that are 
influencing that.  But , certainly, our projections are for a gradual increase in inflation, a nd the 
Committee —at least , most participants continue to expect that if we follow along this course , 
that some further adjustments in the federal funds rate will be a ppropriate but gradual.  
SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  Can I just follow up on this 
inflation point ?  Because the numbers have been t icking up, as you said —somewhat , at least.  
And we ’re also , as you said , also at a  point where we have quite close to full employment.  Is 
there a risk that we’ re heading for an overshoot in inflation, and is there, given the greater 
symmetry the F ed has been flaggi ng up , in terms of its inflation target, a greater tolerance for a 
modest overshoot , especially given the long period of undershoots that we ’ve been through?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So I want to make clear th at our inflation objective is 2 percent , and 
we are proj ecting a move back to 2 percent .  And we are not trying to engineer an overshoot of 
inflation, not to compensate for past undershoots, so 2 percent is our objective.  But it is a symmetric objective , and we certainly don ’t seek to overshoot our objective.  But some 
undershoots and overshoots are part of how the economy operates , and our tolerance for those is 
symmetric with respect to under - and overshoots.  We did take note in the statement of the fact 
that inflation ha s picked up in recent months.  I see some of that a s having to do with unusually 
high inflation readings in categories that tend to be quite volatile without very much significance 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 23  
 for inflation over time.  So I ’m wary and haven ’t yet concluded that we have seen any significant 
uptick t hat will be lasting in , for example, in co re inflation.  But we note —the C ommittee notes , 
as it did in December , that we continue to monitor development trends and developments 
closely , and that would include both the fact that recent inflation readings have been on the high 
side, and, as I mentioned , on the other side, that readings on measures of inflation compensation 
and some survey measures have been on the low side.  So , in that sense, there are risks around 
the inflation forecast in both—in both dire ctions. 
LINDSAY DUNSMUIR.  Hi , Lindsay Dunsmuir with Reuters.  Your statement did note 
that, as you ’re saying , that inflation has picked up in recent months , and you do still see it going 
back to 2 percent over the medium term.  Y et policymakers have downgraded GDP growth 
forecast s for this year and one of the inflation measures.  So that to me would indicate a 
weakening economic environment , and I’m wondering how , in that environment , you justify the 
possibility of two rate hikes this year.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So there has been a slight downgrading of the assessment of  
economic growth for this year.  But, nevertheless, growth is expected to run in—somewhat i n 
excess of  potential, so that the labor market is expected to continue to tighten, a nd by the end of 
the year, even edge below levels that —of the unemployment rate —that are estimated to be 
longer in the normal run, and inflation is expec ted to gradually move back to 2 percent  over time.  
We still have, weighing on inflation, the influence of earlier declines in energy prices and a 
prolonged effect from the appreciation of the dollar , but we do expect those transitory influences 
to fade.  And with a continuing —continuing  improvement in the labor market, I think we ’ll see 
upward pressure on infla tion.  And , in that context, the C ommittee sees it ap propriate to—if 
things unfold in that way , to have some further incr eases in the federal funds rate.   It remains 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 23  
 accommodative.  A s I indicated in December —the C ommittee indicated in December, we want 
inflation to go ba ck to 2 percent .  But we also want to be careful not to see some significant 
overshoots , so that we would get behind the curve and potentially be faced with a need to tighten 
in a very rapid fashion later in a way that could undermine the sustainability of  the employment 
gains we  have had.  But we do see some continued tightening in monetary policy to be 
appropriate in that event.  
PETER BARNES.  Chair Yellen, over here.  Hi, Peter Barnes with F ox Business.  Could 
you get a little bit more specific about the  global and economic financial developments that 
continue to pose risks to the U .S. economy?  You did mention a strong dollar there just a second 
ago and slowing global growth.  But are you specifically concerned about , for example, China, 
the emerging markets , and the E .U.?  Could you expand on the risks?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So there has been , by many forecasters , a slight downgrading of 
forecast s of global growth in—over  the coming several years.   The IMF has slightly downgraded 
their forecast s, and other international agencies have as well.  Chinese growth has n’t proven a 
great surprise.  We ’ve anticipated that it would slow over time , and it seems to be slowing as 
well.  Japanese growth in the fourth quarter was negative , and that was something of a surprise.  
And with respect to the euro area, recent indicators suggest perhaps slightly weaker growth.  So 
there’ s been a number of emerging markets —as you know, we ’re suffering under the weight of 
declines in oil prices that a re affecting their economic activity.  Our neighbors both to the north 
and south, Canada and Mexico, are feeling the impacts of lower oil prices on their growth.  So 
our projection for global growth, for those reasons , is slightly lower —not dramatically lo wer, but 
enough lower to make some difference to our forecast .  And , as I indicated, I think that ’s part of 
the reason, along with the associated increase we have seen in some spreads that are involved 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 23  
 in—enter into corporate borrowing rates, and can affect investment decisions .  It’s a reason to 
think that a slightly lower path for the federal funds rate will be appropriate to achieve our 
objectives.   And so what you see here is a virtually unchanged path of economic projections and 
a slightly more ac commodative path that most participants are writing down for what’ s necessary 
to achieve that.  
KATE DAVIDSON.  Thank you.  Kate Davidson from the Wall Street Journal .  Madam 
Chair, you ’ve emphasized repeatedly that every meeting of the FOMC is a live meeting.  You 
have a meeting next month.  Is it possible that you could get enough information between now 
and then to, you know, get you comfortable with raising rates again in April , and w hat would 
you need to see?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I will say again that every meeting is a live meeting.  April 
remains a live meeting , and we will be tracking incoming data.  It’s a slightly shorter period.  We 
have six weeks , but there will be additional data  on the labor market and on various factors that 
pertain to inflation .  So that ’s, you know, that ’s—that is certainly a l ive possibility.  
STEVEN MUFSON.  Two questi ons.  The oil —lower oil prices .  I think a lot of people 
expect  it to lead  to more consumer spending.  What do you—how do you see and how do you 
explain that  that hasn ’t worked out as well —the way a lot of people expect ed?  And also, if oil 
prices were to pop back up to, say , $50, not that high by some standards, what impact would that 
have on inflation?  And w ould you be paying more attention to the overall inflation rate?  Or 
would you then look to the cor e rate to —to—to determine what the Fed ’s policies would be?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me start with the impact of oil prices on consumer s pending.  I 
have to say , it’s very difficult when you look a t patterns of consumer spending to—t here are 
many factors that influence it , and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 23  
 consumer spending, I ’m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any —in any  rigorous 
way.  The typical —the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are 
now is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year.  And some very detailed microdata that I ’ve 
seen on household spending patte rns suggest that there may be a link , as you would expect , from 
reduced bill s—you know, reduced amounts that people pay at the pump to other spending , like 
eating out at—for restaurant meals and other things.  But the aggregate data,  I—you know, is not 
as strong as it —and spending is not as strong as it could be, given the decline.  And , of cour se, 
on the other side, we are —and , you know, it may  be that it will take a while , and it ’s something 
that w ill slowly strengthen ove r time if oil prices stay low .  On the other side , of course, we have 
seen a marked decline in drilling activity , which ha s depressed investment spending , and, of 
course , very substantial layoffs in the energy sector.  
With respect to impact of oil prices on inflation and what would happen if they move up, 
the C ommittee has generally tended to look through movements in oil prices , whether they were 
on the upside or on the downside, viewing it as a factor that should have a transitory influence.  
And w hen I say that, what I mean is that if o il prices move up during the time that it’ s moving 
up, it raises inflation.  But they don’ t need to move down again to their previous levels for that 
influence to disappear , they only need to stabilize at a higher level.  And , similarly, oil prices 
have obviously moved down a great deal over the last year , and we ’re not expecting them to 
move back to their previous levels but to stabilize at some level.  They ’re obviously volatile , but, 
as they stabilize, the influence w ill move out of both headline —of headline inflation.  And that ’s 
what you see in the forecasts of participants.  So if oil prices were to increase to 50, I mean, that would probably slightly move up our expected path for core inflation, maybe speed how rapidly 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 23  
 we would move back to 2 percent , but I wouldn’ t think that that would be something alone that 
would have great policy significance.  
MART IN CRUTSINGER.   Marty  Crutsinger , Associated Press.  You said in—t he policy 
statement in December  said that the risk s to the outlook were “ balanced ,” and you raised rates.  
That phrasing disappeared then in January and March.  Co uld you talk a little bit about—but in 
your comments today, you seem to be indicating that not that much has changed.  Could you 
help us understand what needs to happen to get bac k to “ balanced ,” and is that the language we 
need to look for to see the next rate hike?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me say that, in recent weeks, I think the C ommittee certainly 
thinks that risks to the outlook have diminished.  Nevertheless, we continue to see risks , which 
we highlighted.  Now, I would point out that we decided not to describe the balance of risks  as 
weighted to the downside.  So the C ommittee did not reach that judgment, and there is no 
collective judgment in this statement on whether the r isks are balanced or not.  My —we declined 
to make a collective assessment.  You know, my guess is that some participants see them as balanced , and some see them as weighted somewhat to the downside.  
But I think it is important to note a couple of things.  First of all, the U .S. economy has 
been very resilient in recent months in the face of shocks , and we highlighted that right at the 
beginning of our statement , where we said that “ economic activity has been expanding at a 
moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months .”  And 
that—that is important, that the U .S. economy continues to do well.  Second, I would say that 
while global developments do pose some downside risks, the risks are not all one  sided .  A 
number of countries —including China, the e uro area , the Bank of Japan —have taken measures 
to stimulate the economy , so there is also upside risk to the economic outlook.  And , in addition, 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 23  
 oil prices have rebounded from their lows , and that eases concerns about the fi nancial condition 
of some energy firms and the stresses facing some oil -producing economies.  And , at the same 
time, low oil prices continue to boost household purchasing power.  So there are risks .  We’re 
attentive to them.  We have not described them as unbalanced to the out —to the downside , and 
they are two  sided .  One can identify both upside and downside risks t here.  
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times .  Wage growth thus far 
has been disappointing.  It’s been very uneven.  It was disappointing , figures in last month ’s jobs 
report.  Why do you think that is , and how important is sustained wage growth to removing your 
wariness on inflation?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I must say I ’m—I do see broad -based improvement in the labor 
market , and I’m somewhat surprised that we ’re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth.  But 
at least —and I have to say , in anecdotal reports, we do hear quite a number of reports of firms 
facing wage pressures and even broad -based, slightly faster increases in wages —wage increases 
that they ’re granting.   But in the aggregate data, one doesn ’t yet see any convincing evidence of 
a pickup in wage growth.  It’s mainly isolated to certain sectors and occupations.  So I  do think, 
consistent with the 2 percent  inflation objec tive, that there is certainly scope for further increases 
in wages.  The fact that we have not seen any broad -based pickup is one of the factors that 
suggest s to me that there is continued slack in the labor market , but I would expect wage growth 
to move up some. 
PATRICK GILLESPIE.  Patrick Gillespie with CNNMoney.  Chair Yellen, numerous 
polls show —by CNN and others —show that the U .S. economy is American voters ’ number one 
concern right now .  There’ s a lot of negative sentiment about the economy , yet unem ployment is 
low, job gains have been pretty good for the past year, a nd consumer confidence has picked up.  
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 23  
 Why do you think there is such disparity  between  the progress —between the economy and its 
progress and how voters feel?  And my second question is , how does a ny negative sentiment 
about the economy factor into your economic outlook and the decisions you make on monetary 
policy?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Let me start with your second question, if I might.  So in trying to 
judge the outlook for the economy, we do look at measures pe rtaining to consumer sentiment, 
and they a re in solid territory.  Household balance sheets are much improved.  Gains in inflation -
adjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace.  As I mentioned, households have bene fited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of  consumer sentiment do 
reflect —do reflect that.  So they  are not at low level s.  And , really , the labor market, I think, has 
improved a great deal .  And every demographic group that, you know , we track regularly has 
seen improvement in their labor market situation —perhaps not all equally , but almost all 
demographic groups have seen improvement.  So I —I think it ’s right to say the economy is 
improving , and most groups are seeing benefits. 
That said, we know that inequality has been rising in the United States over many years, 
not just the last several but going back to the mid- ’80s.  There has been downwa rd pressure on 
real wage groups —on real wage gains for groups , particularly those that  are l ess skilled and 
educated, and those longer -term trends that may be assoc iated with a number of factors —
technol ogical change and globalization —have been a concern for many, many years, a nd that 
may be part of what you’ re—we ’re seein g expressed.  
CHRIS TOPHER  CONDON.  Thank you, right here .  Chair Yellen, there seems to be 
some growing sentiment that even if the direct economic tie s between the U .S. and other 
economies i s still relatively modest, that the impact through financial markets and exchange rates 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 23  
 has become more robust.  And because of that, it ’s becoming more difficult or will become more 
difficult for the F ed to diverge from other major central banks with its  benchmark interest rate.  
Would you generally  agree with that sentiment?  Why or why no t? 
And, very briefly, second , if I may —in your mind, does it undermine in any way the 
standing of the Federal Reserve as a nonpartisan institution when one of its sitting G overnors 
contributes to the campaign of a national political figure?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YE LLEN.  So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.  We 
have global capital markets.  In—in a world with highly  integrated capital markets, monetary 
policy actions in any country have e ffects —spillovers to other countries.  T hat’s true of our 
monetary policy, and it ’s true of other countries ’ monetary policies.  In part, that shows up 
through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs 
to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stanc e of monetary policy.  So the fact 
that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.  
But it does not mean that monetary —U.S. monetary policy is somehow constrained in a 
way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy  to diverge from policies abroad.  There are 
many periods when monetary policies in different countries have moved in different directions , 
and, you know, the United States has been growing more strongly and had better success in the 
labor market than many  other advanced countries.  And , at this point, it’ s natural that there 
should be some divergence in our monetary policies.  Movements in  exchange rates partly reflect 
that.  
So I wouldn’ t want to endorse the notion if, you know —that you ’re suggesting , that our 
policy is in some way crippled by the fact that there are these interlinkages .  That’s simply how 
the glo bal financial system works.  We —this is one reason we meet —meet  frequently with other 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 23  
 economic policymakers in other countries, exchange notes about how we see economic  
developments evolve, and try to keep one another apprised of economic developments and likely 
policy responses. 
Your second question concerned the political contributions.  So I want to start by saying 
that I ’ve been involved for many years in the Federal Reserve System, and we are a non partisan , 
independent institution devoted to pursuing our congr essionally  mandated objectives, and I have 
never seen political views in any way influence the policy judgments th at are made inside the 
Federal Reserve.  I want to say that emphatically.  
The political activities of G overnors, participants, government employees are governed 
by the Hatch Act.  We are all subject to that, and the Hatch Act does allow campaign contribut ions to be made.  It outlaws other forms of partisan activity.  And I would say, w ithin 
that, so it is  each —it’ s up to each individual to decide what is appropriate , in their point of view.  
But the Federal Reserve is not —is not  a partisan political organization.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  The policy, the 
projections —the new economic projections appear to reflect an increase in your estimate of the 
extent of labor market slack.   You talked about one possible reason for that , which is the softness 
of wage growth.  Are there other considerations that have led you to increase your estimate of how much slack there is in the labor market?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So I should point out that I think what you ’re talking about is the 
slight decline in the median estimate of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  Is that —is 
that what you ’re— 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  That, and the slope of  the path of rate increases combined 
with projections of relatively low  inflation.  
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 23  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest 
decline in estimates of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  That, I would say , reflects, for 
those who brought it down, an estimate of greater slack in the labor market.  The f ed funds r ate 
projection is not just that .  It’s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in  other views about , for 
example, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve 
our objectives.  But the slow pace of wage growth,  the fact that part -time employment for 
economic reasons and voluntary part -time employment remains high —we have seen an upward 
move in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the la bor market.  My guess is that those things influence d individuals 
who wrote down a sligh tly lower number for the longer -run un employment rate.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  We ’ve 
heard a lot of talk today about President Obama’ s pick for the Supreme Court , but there are a 
number of vacancies on the Fed Board of Governors , and there ’s a new position, the V ice 
Chair[man]  for S upervision, that the P resident hasn ’t even nominated anyone for.  Would you 
like the P resident to nom inate someone for that position, a nd what effect are those vacancies 
having on the F ed? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think Congress intended for the Federal Reserve Board to 
have seven members, a nd that tends to bring on board people with a wide spectrum of views and 
experience and perspectives.  I think that ’s valuable, and I would like to see the Senate move 
forward and consider these nominees so that we could operate with a full complement . 
With respect to the nomination  for V ice C hair[man]  [for]  Supervision, t hat’s a question 
that I think you need to pose to the White House.  I, you know, would say that we are doing  a 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 23  
 very good job on supervision, and, you know, we are very focused on and devote a great deal of 
time to that issue.  So , real ly, it’s—the nomi nation question is one for the White House. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.   John Helt man with American Banker .  
The P resident last week expressed concern about what he termed “cynicism”  on both sides of the 
aisle concerning progress made since the crisis to reform the banking sector and the financial 
sector more generally.  Do you share that concern about , kind of , public attitudes that either not 
enough has been done or what has been done has not been effective in changing the regulatory landscape in banking ?  Just what are your thoughts?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I feel a great deal has been done.  We have been working at this 
for a number of years , and I believe we have made very substantial progress.  We have a—much 
more capital, higher -quality capital, liquidity in the bankin g system.  Our supervision has —we  
have mad e very meaningful changes for —in our supervision, for example.  The stress tests—the  
stress- test methodology that we use routinely to evaluate the robustness of the capital positions 
and plans of the largest institutions constitutes a quantum leap in terms of, I think, the quality of the supervision we are providing , especially of the largest firms.  So  we have finished writing 
most of the Dodd- Frank rules .  We  are working very hard on “ too big to f ail,” which is of grave 
concern to the American people.  
In addition to having a financial system that is more robust and less likely to experience a 
failure, we ha ve also worked very hard, continue  to work on making sure we have  the ability to 
resolve a firm i f it were to fail in spite —in spite  of having more capital and liquidity.  And there, 
too, I think, we  have made very substantial progress.  
A month or so ago, we came out with a r ule—so -called TLAC rule—that would require 
the largest firms to hold a substantia l buffer of long -term debt that, in the event that they were to 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 23  
 fail, could be bailed in to protect the taxpayer from having to bear any burden in terms of 
injecting capital into the firms —it would provide loss absorption in that event.  And working 
jointly, closely with the FDIC, firms have made a great deal of p rogress with their living wills.   
We’re in the process of evaluating the most recent submissions.  And working with the FDIC, I 
think, potential techniques that could be used in the event of a failure of a significant financial institution, we  have also made a lot of progress there.  
I think I was at the meeting of  financial regulators with the P resid ent when he made t hose 
comments, and I understood that what he was trying to tell the American people , that they should 
understand there really has  been very substantial progress, and that ’s something they should be 
aware of.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Can I follow up, just real quick?   Sorry .  But do you think that , 
despite all that progress , that there—why hasn ’t that message —why hasn ’t—why haven ’t these 
improvements made its way to the public?  And perhaps, like, do you find that that is an obstacle either among people that you meet,  people in the public , or the representatives in Congress that 
maybe have this pervasive view that nothing has changed?  Is that an obstacle?  Is that a problem?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think —I think it ’s our job as we make these improvements to 
explain wha t we’re doing and to try to educate t he public about what ’s happened, a nd they may 
not understand how much has changed.  It’s certainly part of my own responsibility to try to 
explain that to the American people.  
KAREN MRACEK.  Karen Mracek with Market News International .  In the SEP today, 
the unemployment rate forecast for future years —for 2017, 2018—was marked dow n without 
changes to inflation, a nd there seems to be a growing debate about the relationship between 
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 23  
 higher —lower unemployment and higher i nflation.  What is your view about the strength of this 
relationship, the Phillips curve , and how does that view weigh in to just how much actual 
inflation versus anticipation —anticipated inflation you ’ll need to see?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  O kay, so t hat was a com plicated question, and there —let me start 
with the Phillips curve.  So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the 
degree of slack in  the labor market and inflation, a nd it is an empirical relationship that, while 
not absolutely tigh t, has been a con sistent relationship over time, a nd I believe that  relationship 
still holds.   But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be 
overstated.  The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in  unemployment have only a modest impact on i nflation , so we shouldn’ t 
overblow how large that is. 
In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an 
important driver of actual wage-  and pri ce-setting  decisions and inflation behavior, a nd I believe 
there’ s also solid empirical evidence for that.  And it ’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my 
statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement , that  we are tracking indicators 
of the inflation expectation s that matter to wage and price  setting . 
Now, unfortunately, we don’ t have perfect measures of these things.  We have survey 
measures.  We know that household measures, even when households are asked about longer -
term inflation —at longer -term inflation, they tend to move in response to salient changes in 
prices that they see every day .  In part icular, when gas prices go down, which is very  noticeable 
to most households, you tend to see a view —you tend to see responses about long -term inflation 
marked d own.  So that ’s kind of an over response to something that ’s transitory.  So it ’s difficult 
to get a clear read from those survey measures.  
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 23  
 Inflation compensation a s measured in financial markets also embo dies a variety of risk 
premia and liquidity premia.  And so, it ’s also —we monitor those closely and discuss them in the 
statement in paragra ph one , but, again, there ’s not a straight read on what ’s happening to the 
expectation s that influence wage and pric e setting.  But  this model continues to at least influence 
my own thinking , and it certainly is a factor that I and at least  some of my colleagues are 
incorporating in these projections. 
ERIK SCHATZKER.  Eri k Schatzker, Bloomberg Television.  Madam Chair, thank y ou.  
Notwithstanding what the dot s tell us about rate expectations, has there been any d iscussion 
among members of the C ommittee about the potential need for further stimulus?  And even if 
there hasn ’t been such a discussion yet, could you share wit h us what you have learned from the 
reevaluation of negative interest rates, whether you consider negative interest rates effective, 
how effective relative to quanti tative easing, and whether the C ommittee would hyp othetically 
use them instead of  or in conju nction with quantitative easing  in the event that the economy 
should warrant further stimulus?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  O kay.  So what I would like to make clear is that this is not actively a 
subject that we are considering or discussing.  The C ommittee continues  to feel that we are on a 
course where the economy is improving and inflation is moving back up.  And, as I indicated, if events continue to unfold in that way, we are likely to gradually raise rates over time.  Again, that’s not fixed in stone.  We’ll watch how the economy behaves.  We ’re prepared to respond if 
things transpire differently , but we are not spending time actively debating and considering 
things we could do for additional accommodation and certainly not actively considering negative rates.   We are looking at th e experience in other countries, and I guess I would judge they seem 
to have mixed effects, you know, some positive and some negative things.  
March 16, 2016  Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 23  
 But, look, if we found ourselves in the unlikely situation where we needed to add 
accommodation , we have a range of tools .  And we know from the things we did in the past that 
we have a number of options with respect to the maturity, for example, of our portfolio, with 
respect to asset purchases or forward guida nce that remain available to us , that are tools we could 
turn to in the unlikely event that we need to add accommodation.  S o negative rates is  not 
something that we ’re actively considering.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
June  15, 2016 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Today, the Federal Open Market Committee 
maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at  ¼ to ½ percent.   This accommodative 
policy should support further progress toward our statutory objectives of maximum employment 
and price stability.   Based on the economic outlook, the Committee continues to anticipate that 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time are likely to be consistent with achieving and maintaining our objectives.  However, recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate.  As 
always, our policy is not on a preset course , and if the economic outl ook shifts, the appropriate 
path of policy will shift correspondingly.  I will come back to our policy decision, but first I will 
review recent economic developments and the outlook. 
Economic growth was relatively weak late last year and early this year.   Some of the 
factors weighing on growth were expected .  For example, exports have been soft, reflecting 
subdued foreign demand and the earlier appreciation of the dollar.  Also, activity in the energy 
sector has obviously been hard hit by the steep drop in oil prices since mid -2014.  But the 
slowdown in other parts of the economy was not expected.  In particular, business investment 
outside of energy was particularly weak during the winter and appears to have remained so into the spring.  In addition, growth in household spending slowed noticeably early in the year despite 
solid increases in household income as well as relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth.   Fortunately, the first -quarter slowdown in household spending appears to have been 
temporary; indicators for the second quarter have so far pointed to a sizable rebound.  This 
recovery is a key factor supporting the Committee ’s expectation that overall economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 21  
 Despite lackl uster economic growth, the job market continued to improve early in the 
year.   During the first quarter, job gains averaged nearly 200,000 per month, just a bit slower 
than last year ’s pace.   And the unemployment rate held near 5 percent even though notabl y more 
people were actively looking for work.  However, more recently the pace of improvement in the 
labor market appears to have slowed markedly.  Job gains in April and May are estimated to have averaged only about 80,000 per month.  And while the unempl oyment rate fell to 
4.7 percent in May, that decline occurred because fewer people reported that they were actively seeking work.  A broader measure of unemployment that includes individuals who want and are available to work but have not searched recently  as well as people who are working part time but 
would rather work full time has flattened out.  On a more positive note, average hourly earnings increased 2 ½ percent over the past 12 months —a bit faster than in earlier years and a welcome 
indication that wage growth may finally be picking up.  Although recent labor market data have, 
on balance, been disappointing, it ’s important not to overreact to one or two monthly readings.  
The Committee continues to expect that the labor market will strengthen further  over the next 
few years.   That said, we will be watching the job market carefully.  
Ongoing economic growth and an improving labor market underpin our inflation outlook.  
Overall consumer price inflation —as measured by the price index for personal consumpt ion 
expenditures —was about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in April, still short of our 
2 percent objective.   Much of this shortfall continues to reflect the effects of earlier declines in 
energy prices and lower prices for imports.  Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent.   As the transitory influences holding down inflation 
fade, and as the labor market strengthens further, the Committee expects inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to thr ee years.  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 21  
 Our inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment that longer -run inflation 
expectations remain reasonably well anchored.   However, we can ’t take the stability of longer -
run inflation expectations for granted.  While most survey measur es of longer -run inflation 
expectations show little change, on balance, in recent months, financial market  measures of 
inflation compensation have declined.  Movements in these indicators reflect many factors and 
therefore may not provide an accurate readi ng on changes in the inflation expectations that are 
most relevant for wages and prices.   Nonetheless, in considering future policy decisions, we will 
continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.  
Let me now turn to the individual economic projections submitted for this meeting by 
FOMC participants.   As always, each participant ’s projections are conditioned on his or her own 
view of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depends on each person’ s assessment of th e 
multitude of factors that shape the outlook.  Participants ’ projections for growth of inflation-
adjusted gross domestic product are slightly lower in the near term than the projections made for the March FOMC meeting.   The median growth projection now re mains at 2 percent through 
2018, in line with its estimated longer -run rate.   The median projection for the unemployment 
rate edges down from 4.7  percent at the end of this year to 4.6 percent in the next two years, 
somewhat below the median assessment of the longer -run normal unemployment rate.  The 
median path of the unemployment rate is little changed from March.  Finally, the median inflation projection stands at 1.4 percent this year, a bit firmer than in March, and then rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in  2018.  
Returning to monetary policy, as I said, the Committee maintained its target range for the 
federal funds rate.   This decision reflects the Committee ’s careful approach in setting monetary 
policy, particularly in light of the mixed re adings on the labor market and economic growth that I 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 21  
 have discussed as well as continuing below -target inflation.   Proceeding cautiously in raising our 
interest rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace, 
that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2 percent objective.  Caution is all the more appropriate given that short -term interest 
rates are still near zero, which means that monetary policy can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future than to a weakening labor market and falling  inflation.  
Although the financial market stresses that emanated from abroad at the start of this year 
have eased, vulnerabilities  in the global economy remain.  In the current environment of sluggish 
global growth, low inflation, and already very accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of, and appetite for, risk can change abruptly.  As our statement notes, we will continue to closely monitor global economic and financial 
developments. 
We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual 
increases in the federal funds rate.   We expect the rate to remain, for some tim e, below levels 
that are anticipated to prevail in the longer run because headwinds weighing on the economy mean that the interest rate needed to keep the economy operating near its potential is low by historical standards.  These headwinds —which include developments abroad, subdued 
household formation, and meager productivity growth—could persist for some time.   But, if they 
gradually fade over the next few years as we expect, then the interest rate required to keep the economy operating at an even keel should move higher as well. 
This view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1½ percent at the end of 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 21  
 next year and 2 ½ percent by the end of 2018, somewhat below its estimated longer -run normal 
level.   Although the median federal funds rate at the end of this year is unchanged from March, a 
number of participants revised down their projections.  For 2017 and 2018, the median projection 
is ¼ to ½ percentage point lower than in March, roughly in line with the ¼  percentage point 
downward revision made to the estimated longer -run level of the federal funds rate.  
As I have noted on previous occasions, participants ’ projections for the federal funds rate , 
including the median path, are not a fixed plan for future policy.  P olicy is not on a pre set course.   
These forecasts represent participants ’ individual assessments of appropriate policy given their 
projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors.  However, the 
economic outlook is inherently uncertain, so each participant ’s assessment of appropriate policy 
is also necessarily uncertain, especially at longer time horizons, and will change in response to changes to the economic out look and associated risks. 
Finally, the Committee will continue its policy of reinvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.   
As highlighted in our policy statement, we anticip ate continuing this policy until normalization 
of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer -term securities should help maintain accommodative financial conditions and should 
reduce the risk that we might have to lower the federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock.  
 Thank you, I  will be happy to take your questions. 
SAM FLEMING.   Thanks  very much .  Sam Fleming from the  Financial Times .  One of 
the big uncertainties hangin g over markets right now is clearly the vote in the United Kingdom 
next week.   How much of a factor was that in today ’s decision , relative to the questions you ’ve 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 21  
 elucidated about, the  domest ic jobs numbers and inflation data ?  And could you talk a little bit 
about the channels that you think about when you talk about the potential impact of a  Brexit on 
the U .S. economy?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, Brexit, the upcoming U .K. decision on whether or not to leave 
the European Union, is something we discuss ed, and I think it ’s fair to say that it was one of the 
factors that factored into today ’s decisions —clearly this is  a very important decision for the 
United Kingdom and for Europe.  It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and 
financial conditions in global financial markets.  If it does so, it could have consequences in turn 
for the U .S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of 
policy.  So it is certainly one of the uncertainties that we discussed an d that factored in to 
today ’s decision.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Thank you.  The F ed’s outlook for ra tes has come down sharply for 
2018 especially, but it ’s been coming down gradually over  time —almost a  full percentage point 
in som e cases , compared to a year ago —and  yet the GDP outlook remai ns the same.  W hat has 
happened i n, say , just the past quarter to the Committee ’s outlook for rates to bring it down so 
much for, say , 2018, where it ’s now just  2.4 percent and further from the long run than it was , 
say, in the pr ior estimate that was out there ?  Has there been a dramatic change in the 
Committee ’s view on the relationship of GDP to rates?  And mayb e you c ould also explain why 
the F ed has to keep lowering these rates and getting that forecast wrong . 
CHAIR YELLEN.  S o, as I mentioned in my opening remarks , there is really a great deal 
of uncertainty around each individual ’s assessment of the appropriate level of rates , particularly 
as we go further out in the forecast horizon and when we come to the long term .  And I think 
what we can see, and what many econometric and other studies  show , is that the so -called neutral 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 21  
 rate—namely , the level of  the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing 
roughly a t trend a nd operating near full employment—t hat rat e is quite depressed by historical 
standards.  Many estimates would put it, in real or inflation -adjusted terms , near zero.  
Now, the path that you see in the dot plot for rates over time is importantly 
influenced —there is accommodation , and as we achieve our objectives, I think most participants 
feel that the accommodation in the current stance of policy needs to be gradually removed, but a 
very important influence in the out years is , what will happen to that neutral rate that will just 
keep the economy operating on an even keel?  And I ’ve often in my statements and remarks 
talked about headwinds that reflect lingering effects of the financial crisis ; to the extent that there 
are headwinds, I think many of us expect that these headwinds would gradually dim inish over  
time, and that ’s a reason why you see the upward path for rates.  
But there are also more long -lasting or persistent factors that may be at work that are 
holding down the longer -run level of n eutral rates —for example, slow  productivi ty growth, 
which is not just a  U.S. phenomenon but a global phenomenon.  You know, obviously, there is a 
lot of uncertainty about what will  happen to productivity growth, but  productivity growth could 
stay long for  a prolonged time , and we have an aging—aging societies  in many parts of the world 
that could depress this neutral rate.1  And I think all of us are involved in a process of constantly 
reevaluating where is that neutral rate going , and I think what you see is a downward shift in that 
assessment over  time , the sense that maybe more of what ’s causing  this neutral rate to be low are 
factors that are not g oing to be rapidly disappearing  but will be part of the new normal.  Now, 
                                                 
1 Chair Yellen intended to say, “ You know, obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen to 
productivity growth, but productivity growth could stay low for a prolonged time, and we have an aging —aging 
societies in many parts of the world that could depress this neutral rate. ”  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 21  
 you still see an  assessment that that neutral rate will move up somewhat, but it has bee n coming 
down, and I think it continues to be marked lower .  And it is highly uncertain, for all of the dots.  
JASON LANGE.   Hi, I’m Jason Lang e with Reuters .  The median participant forecast for 
the fed funds rate for 2017 and 2018 came down quite dramatically, b ut this stands in contrast 
with the 2016 meeting forecast.  As you mentioned, there were a number —actually , six—
participants who saw only one rate hike this year.  Can you comment on what it would take for 
two rate increases to be a —the  likely or appropriate policy path?  And about this disconnect 
between the median view and the view of the, say, the voting members of the C ommittee?   If 
there is one, I should add.  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I ’m not going to comment on participants versus voters.  You 
know, mone tary policy —the Committee feels that mon etary policy —when we are looking at 
several years, we should show the public what the views are of all the participants in the 
Committee , especially given that voting —voting rotates every year, and so that ’s a decision we 
made.  
But you asked me what it would take to have two increases.  So, you know, the 
Committee as a whole never discusses , how many increases should we have this year or next 
year—that ’s not a decision we ’re making as a Committee.  We ’re making decisions on a 
meeting -by-meeting basis and trying to give a sense to the public of what we ’re looking for and 
what the basis of a decision will be.  And , as I indicated, first of all, internationa l uncertainties 
loom large here;  we mentioned Brexit , the U.K. decision, obviously how that turns out is 
something that will factor into future decisions.  And we ’re also looking at the prospects for 
economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.  The forecast t hat you see in the 
SEP and the statement indicate the  Committee continues to expect w e will have moderate 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 21  
 growth, 2 percent growth —so , you know, suggest s healthy growth for the rest of the year and a 
pickup i n growth in the second quarter , and we expect to  see continuing progress in the 
labor  market.  
Now, we had ques tions about the growth outlook because we did see slower growth in 
the fourth quarter and in the first quarter.  I have to say there , with respect to the slowdown we 
saw in consumer spending , that seemed to be out of line with fundamentals.  We expected it to 
pick up, and we ’ve seen very good evidence that it has picked up .  But now , the labor mark et 
appears to have slowed down, a nd we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in 
the economy has not diminished.  So, as I said, we will be carefully assessing data on the labor 
market to make sure that job gains are going to continue at  a pace sufficient to result in further 
improvement in the labor market.  And we will be watching the  spending data to make sure 
growth is picking up in line with our expectations . 
Of cour se, with respect to inflation , we’re constantly evaluating whether or not 
incoming information is roughly in line with our expectations.  So we will be ev aluating that a t 
every meeting ; every meeting  is live , and we could make a decision at any m eeting to adjust the 
funds rate, but that ’s the kind of thing that we will want to see to make such decisions. 
BINYAMIN APP ELBAUM .  The  Fed created a labor m arket c onditions i ndex  a couple 
of years ago that was designed to sort of bring together a lot of these factors in the labor m arket 
that you’ ve talked about .  As I’m sure you know , it’s been falling since January.  That suggests 
to some people that it was your decision to raise  rates in December that has caused this 
weakening in the labor market .  Could you address what role , if any , you think the F ed’s decision 
to raise rates has played in the slowdown we are now seeing?  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 21  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, let me just say the l abor market c onditions i ndex is a kind of 
experimental research product that ’s a summary measu re of many different indicators , and, 
essentially , that measure tries to assess the change in the labor market conditions.  As I look at it , 
and as that index  looks at things, t he state of the labor market is still healthy, but there ’s been 
something of a loss of momentum :  The  200,000 jobs a month we saw, for example, in the first 
quarter of the year , that ’s slowed in recent months. 
Exactly what the reasons are for that slowing,  it’s difficult to say.  It may turn out —you 
know, again, we should never pay  too much attention to, for example, one job market report.  
There’s a large error around that , we often see large revisions, w e should not overblow the 
significance of one data p oint, especially when other  indicators of the labor market are still 
flashing green :  Initial claims for une mployment insurance remain low ; perceptions of the labor 
market remain fine; d ata from the JOLTS  on job openings continue to reach new highs.  So 
there’ s a good deal of incoming data that does  signal c ontinued progress and strength in the labor 
market, but, as I say, it does bear  watching.  
So, the C ommittee doesn ’t feel and doesn ’t expect , and I don’ t expect , that labor 
market —progress in the labor  market has come to an end.  We have tried to make clear to the 
public and through our actions and through the revisions you see —have seen over time in the dot 
plot—that we do not have a fixed plan for raising rates over time .  We look at incoming data and  
are prepared to adjust our view s to keep the economy on track, and , in light of that data 
dependence of our policy , I really don ’t think that a single rate increase of 25 basis points in 
December has any—has had much significance for the outlook.  And we will continue to adjust 
our thinking in light of incoming data in  whatever direction is appropriate.  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 21  
 JON HILSENRATH.  Chair Yellen, I want to come back to these longer -run rate 
projections that you ’ve been asked about.  So, yields on 10- year T reasury notes  have fallen 
below 1.6 percent; on 5- year notes, they ’re near 1 percent.  Elsewhere in the world, in Germany 
and Japan, long -term bond yields are negative.  Does —how do you explain this low level of 
long-term bond yields?  And does it give you any pause in looking at your own projections and 
coming to a conclusion about whether those projections are possibly still way too high when the 
bond market is at a much lower level?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think the levels of longer -term rates reflect essentially two 
things.  One is market expectations about the path of short -term rates over , if we ’re considering, 
say, a 10-year T reasury security, what would be the path of short -term rates over the next 
10 years.  And the second factor is the so- called term premium , or th e extra yield that investors 
demand in order to hold a longer -term security instead of to invest short term.  And clearly, 
market expectations for the path of short -term interest rates over the next 10 years remain low , 
and that is a factor.  That is an important factor that ’s, I think, holding down the level of longer -
term yields.   But, perhaps a s important , or maybe even more important , the term premium is also 
low and has probably come down.  Now, when we engaged in longer -term asset purchases, our 
very purpose in doing that was to drive down l onger -term yields by making these  asset s scarce —
scarcer  and, hence, more valuable to the public that wants to invest in long -term securities , and 
we were consciously attempting to drive down that term premium. 
Now, we continue to hold a  large quantity of those securities, but we ’re not adding to 
them.   But, in many parts of the world—the ECB , for example, and the B ank of Japan  are also 
engaging in quantitative easing , buying longer -term assets and pushing down those term premia.  
So I think term premia are very low as well as the expected path of short rates . 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 21  
 JON HILSENRATH.  Do these yield levels give you any uncertainty , any doubt about 
whether —are you going to be able to get rates  to where projections say they ’re going?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, so I want to say again, w e’re quite uncertain about where rates 
are heading in the longer term.  We write down our best estimates a t this time of what is a 
longer -run normal level of the federa l funds rate , and those are numbers about which there is 
great uncertainty.  As I said, we have good reason to believe that the so- called neutral rate or rate 
compatible with the economy operating at full employment is low at  the present time.  And many 
of us believe , as a base case, it’ s reasonable to assume that those rates will move up over time, 
but we ’re not certain of that.  It is—it’s one of the uncertainties that —and there could be 
revisions in either direction, but thus far, in recent S EPs, I’d say  the revisions have mainly 
been —have been in the downward direction.  The idea that a low neutral rate may  be more —
closer to the new normal, but you still do see some reversion.  So we ’re really quite uncertain 
about that. 
YLAN MUI.  In your speech in Philadelphia, you called the slowdown in job growth last 
month “ concerning ,” and you mentioned today that you want to verify that the underlying 
momentum in  the economy and in the labor market is still continuing.  What do you need to see  
to convince you that the labor market is  still movi ng toward full employment , and  for how long 
would you need to see it?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I can ’t give you a formula , I know you would probably like to 
have a number that ’s a cutoff for what we need to see in a particular report.  There are a lot of 
different indicators of the labor market —for example, the l abor m arket c onditions i ndex that 
Binya  referred to has 19 different indicators.  Clearly, we will be looking at the next job report , 
and if we were to s ee a healthy pace of job growth, you know, above that needed to kind of 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 21  
 maintain the status quo i n the labor market.  So, you know, I should say, over  time, we should 
expect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of job 
gains is probably going to slow  down somewhat.  And we have seen some slowing.  But the 
recent couple of months was very low and, arguably , not eve n at the pace we need to see to  
maintain stable labor market conditions.  So we want to see an adequate pace of job creation.  There might be revisions to previous months that would change our views , but there will be other 
surveys of employment intentions and other indicators of the labor market that w e’ll focus —
we’ll be focusing on.  So, there is no formula for what it takes, but we will be looking at the 
labor market.  Did you want to follow up?  
YLAN MUI.  So rry, I had a quick follow -up.  Also in your speech in Philadelphia, you 
did not say that you felt that it would be probably appr opriate for a rate hike to occur in the 
coming months.  Do you —did you intentionally leave that out?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  You know, we do need to make sure that there is sufficient 
momentum.  I don’ t know what the timetable is going to be to gain that assurance.  Every 
meeting is live ; there is no meeting that is off the table , that —no meeting is out in terms of a 
possible rate increase.  But, we really need to look at the data , and I can ’t prespecify a timetable.  
So I’m, you know, not comfortable to say it ’s in the next meeting or two, but it could be, it could 
be, it ’s not impossible.  It’s not impossible that b y July, for example, we would see data that led 
us to believe that we ’re on a perfectly fine course, and that data was an aberration , and other 
concerns  would have passed. 
PETER BARNES.  Ma ’am, Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Hi.  We are in  an election 
season , and in the past, the F ed has been sensitive to making policy changes in election years.  
You have three more meetings before the November presidential election.  Could you comment 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 21  
 on whether or not the election will come into play , and any concern that if you change p olicy 
ahead of the election and, based on your forec ast today, you obviously  could—a re you concerned 
that that cou ld then lead to charges that the F ed is trying to change policy to influence the 
outcome of the election, because the Fed  has been sensitive to that in the past?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we are very focused on ass essing the economic outlook and 
making changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account.  Look, if the data —
incoming data were, in the coming months , to justify the kind of gradual increases that we  have 
long discussed, that we see a s appr opriate in light of the outlook, I think market s should not be 
surprised by such a decision if we make it.  And it ’s obviously consistent with the data that 
we’ve seen , and the Committee will feel free to move in the coming months if we think it’ s 
appropri ate.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.   Jeanna  Smialek,  Bloomberg.  You mentioned in your remarks at 
the beginning that we are getting a slightly different signal when you look at inflation versus 
when you look at inflation expectations.  Could you detail a little bit wh ich you look at and sort 
of weight  more?  Are you more concerned with the inflation expectations or focusing more on 
the slight pickup in actual  inflation?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   Well, we ’re looking at both.  You know, I would say, with respect to 
the behavior of inflation, inflation is behaving roughly in the manner I would have expected;  I 
have really not seen significant surprises there.  W e’ve long said th at an important reason that 
inflation is as low as it’ s been is b ecause of past declines in  energy prices a nd increases in the 
value of the dollar , and as those factors began to dissipate, we would see inflation moving up.  
Now, that ’s exactly what we’ re seeing, what we’ re—that ’s in line with our thinking and with the 
data.  So, those things have stabilized, th eir influence is  dissipating.  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 21  
 And with respect to c ore inflation, which—now , that ’s partly influenced also by the 
dollar , but t rying to pull out the dollar and  import price influence —core inflation seems to be 
behaving roughly as one would expect with well -anchored inflation expectations and in 
improving labor markets.  So I ’m not seeing anything —inflation , even core inflation, is running 
under 2 percent .  I continue to think the evidence supports a projection that it will move up over 
the n ext couple of ye ars back toward  our 2  percent  objective.  But, we ’ve seen in the past , and 
economic theory suggests , that inflation expectations are relevant to price and wage setting 
decisions.  So we do monitor indicators of inflation expectations carefully.  
Now, it ’s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual 
price and wage decisions.  And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure of 
household inflation expectations , move down.  It’s hard —that ’s a preliminary numbe r, it’s hard 
to know what to make of it.  We ’ve certainly taken  note of i t.  But survey -based measures that —
where forecasters are queried —have really all been quite stable.  And measures of inflation 
compensation— I always try to be careful to call it “inflation compensation”  rather than 
“inflation expectations ” because they ’re not inflation expectations.  Inflation expectations 
influence those market measures, but there ’s also an inflation risk premium.  And there are 
actually good reasons to think that the  inflation risk premium could have decline d significantly 
and may  be depressing those measures.  So we watch them, we’ ve taken note in the statement 
that they ’ve moved down , but actual inflation is behaving more or less as would be expe cted.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Mart y Crutsinger with the Associated Press.   When the April 
minutes were released, they caught markets by surprise.  In there, they showed—they seem ed to 
show that there was an active discussion of a possible June rate increase, somethi ng that we 
hadn’t gotten from the policy statement that was issued right after the meeting.  Was that a 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 21  
 conscious decision to hold back and tell us in—when the minutes came out about the June 
discussion?  And if so, could you tell us what surprises we coul d see in the June minute s? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the minutes are always —have to be an accurate discussion of 
what happened at the meeting.  So they ’re not changed after the fact in order to correct possible 
misconceptions.  There was a good deal of discussion at that meeting of the possibility of moving in June , and that appeared in the minutes.  
I suppose in the April statement, we gave no obvious hint or  kind of calendar -based 
signal that June was a possibility.  But I think if you look at the statement, we pointed to slower growth but pointed out that the fundamentals —there was no obvious fundamental reason for 
growth to have slowed.  And we pointed to fundamentals underlying household spending 
decisions that remained on solid ground, suggesting that maybe this was something transitory that would disappear.  We noted that labor market conditions continued to improve in line with 
our expectations , and we did downgrade somewhat our expressions of concern about the global 
risk environment.  So I do think that ther e were hints in the April statement that the C ommittee 
was changing its views of what it was seeing in a direction.  We continue to say that we think, if economic developments evolve in line with our expectations, the gradual and cautious further increases  we expect to be appropriate.  And I suppose I was somewhat surprised with the market 
interpretation of it.   But the June  meeting  minute s—the minu tes of the April meeting were an 
accurate summary of what had happened.  
JEREMY TORDJMAN.  Jeremy Tordjman with the AFP news agency.  The F ed has 
repeatedly voiced its concern over the slow pace of wa ge growth, a nd I was wondering, do you 
think that increasing the federal minimum wage could be of any help ?  Could it boost the higher 
wages and eventually drive up the inflation?  
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 21  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think that the minimum wage incre ases that have gone into 
effect —estimates that I ’ve seen suggest it’s a relatively minor influence on the aggregate level of 
wage inflation.  I would take somewhat faster wage increases  to be a sign  that labor market slack 
is diminishing and that the labor market is approaching conditions that are consistent with 
maximum employment.  So, I think, you know, I think we have seen some hints, perhaps 
preliminary indications , that wage growth  is picking up.  And as much as anything, I think it ’s a 
sign of a  generally healthy labor market, which is what our  mandated objective is, to achieve 
maximum employment.  And so it would be a symptom of it.  
GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  There’ s been a lot of discussion in last 
couple months about the slow pace of demand in the global economy, a nd some economists 
think that central banks should think about using helicopter money, maybe in Japan first or Europe first.  But then, former Fed Chairma n Ben Bernanke weighed in saying that he thought it  
would be a good thing for the F ed to put helicopter money in its toolkit in case there was a 
downturn in the United States.  So I ’d like to get your comments on that.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So , in normal times, I think it’ s very important that there  be a 
separation between monetary and fiscal policy , and it ’s a primary reason for independence of a 
central bank.  We have seen all too many examples of countries that end up with high or even hyperinflation because those in charge of fiscal policy direct their central bank to help the m 
finance it by printing money, a nd maintaining price stability and low and stable inflation is very 
much aided by having central bank independence.  
Now, that said, in unusual times wher e the concern is with very weak growth or possibly 
deflation —rather rare circumstances —first of all, fiscal policy can be a very important tool.  And 
it’s natural t hat if it can be employed that, just as  mone tary policy is doing a lot to try to 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 21  
 stimulate g rowth, that fiscal policy should play a role.  And normally, you would hope , in an 
economy with those severe downside risks, monetary and fiscal policy would not be working at 
cross purposes to get —but together.  
Now, whether or not in such extreme circumst ances, there might be a case for, let ’s say, 
coordination—close coordination, with  the central bank playing a role in financing fiscal policy ; 
this is something that academics are debating, and it is something that one might legitimately 
consider.  I would see this as a very abnormal , extreme situation where one  needs an all -out 
attempt, and even then it ’s a matter that academics are debating, bu t only in an unusual situation. 
JUSTINE UNDERHILL.  Justin e Underhill, Y ahoo Finance.  So now that the Fed has  
started the pro cess of raising rates, various F ed officials have said, including Ben Bernanke , that 
the F ed could go cash flow negative in this scenario as capital losses are taken on the portfolio of 
bonds.  Do you still see this happening , and when might this happen?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So you’ re talking about our income going negative?  
JUSTINE UNDERHILL.   Yes.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, it is c onceivable in a scenario when—where growth and 
inflation really surprise us to the upside that we would have  to raise short -term interest rates so 
rapidly that the rates we would be paying on reserves would exceed what we ’re earning on our 
portfolio.  Now even then, we have about $2 trillion of liabilities, namely currency on which we 
pay no interest.  So this does requires an extreme scenario wit h very rapid increases in short -term 
interest rates.  So it is conceivable but quite unlikely that it could happen.  
But, you know, if it were to happen, we would have an economy that would be doing 
very well.  This is pr obably an economy that ev erybody would feel very pleased—was 
performing  well and better than expected, and where monetary policy —you know, our goal is 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 21  
 price stability and maximum employment, and we would probably feel that we had done very 
well in achievin g that.  So, we usually make money —we’ve been making a lot of money in 
recent years , but the goal of monetary policy is not to maximize our income.  And, you know, in 
a very strong economy like that, the Treasury  would be seeing a lot of inflows in the for m of tax 
revenues , too.  
STEVE BECKNER.  Madam Chair, Steve Beckner of Market News International.  To 
what extent do you feel constrained in raising interest rates by the low  or even negative rates that 
foreign  central banks are pursuing , possibly out of concern for what it might mean for the dollar 
exchange rate?  And , if that is a constraint, to what extent are you—might you also be concerned 
about the impact , long range , of low domestic rates on possibly distorting domestic markets?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the  state of foreign economies, both their growth outlooks and the 
stance of monetary policy, t hose are factors that influence the U .S. outlook and influence  the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy.  So, of course, we do look at forei gn rates, the 
prospects —and the prospects for growth in those economies in considering the stance of policy.  
Differentials between countries in  likely policy paths do tend to spill  over into exchange 
rates —that is a standard part of how monetary policy wor ks—and a stronger dolla r, those have a 
both—a depressing effect.  It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed.  At 
the moment, net exports —well, for quite some  time and probably going forward, they will be 
somewhat of a drag on U .S. growth, s o that ’s a factor that we take into account.  And increases 
in the dollar that we ’ve seen since mid -2014 have served to push inflation down as well ; it can 
also have impacts on commodity prices that are relevant.  
So, it ’s—it is certainly relevant to the stance of U .S. monet ary policy and a factor , but 
when one say s “a constraint ,” I really would not go so far as to say  it is a constraint on monetary

 policy.  When we have an outlook for continuing above -trend  growth —that if we held rates 
absolutely flat, we have reason to bel ieve inflat ion would overshoot our target —we would see a 
case to gradually raise rates over time.  At the moment, I think markets do expect, a nd this is 
factored into market prices, a gradual path for r ates to increase over time.  
But, for example, if we were to see upside surprises to growth and to i nflation and had to 
raise short -term r ates faster, thought we should, one of the channels by which that would work 
would be the a ssociated impact on the dollar.  T hat is a standard channel through which the 
monetary poli cy transmission mechanism works, and we would take it into account and would 
not feel constrained , but that would be part of how it would work. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  How much do you—oh, Nancy Marshall -Genzer 
from Marketplace.  How much are you  watching oil pr ices and their impact on inflation , and how 
that could affect the timing of future rate increases and how much you might increase rates?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, oil prices have had many di fferent effects on the economy, and 
so we ’ve been watch ing oil prices closely.  As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation .  
You know, it takes falling oil prices to lower inflation on a sustained basis.  Once they stabilize 
at whatever level, their impact on inflation dissipates over time.   So we ’re beginning to see that 
happening.  N ot only have they stabilized, they have moved up some, and their inflation is —their 
impact on inflation is w aning over time.  But oil prices have also had a very substantial negative 
effect on drilling and mining activity  that’s led to weakness in investment spending and job loss 
in manufacturing and, obviously, in the energy sector. 
Now, you know, it has different effects in different countries and different sectors.  For 
American households, i t’s been a boon.  W e’ve esti mated that since mid -2014, the decline in 
energy prices and oil prices has probably resulted in gains of about $1,400 per U .S. household, 
 June 15, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 21  
 and that ’s had an offsetting positive impact on spending.  But in many countries around the 
world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we ’ve seen in oil prices has had a 
depressing effect on their growth, their trade w ith us and other trade partners, and caused 
problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.  So it ’s a complicated picture.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
September  21, 2016  
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my 
colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee discussed overall economic conditions 
and decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  We judged that the case for an increase has strengthened but decided for the time being to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives.  Our current policy should help move the economy toward our statutory goals of maximum employment and price s tability.  I ’ll have more 
to say about our decision shortly, but first I will review recent economic developments and the outlook. 
Economic growth, which was subdued during the first half of the year, appears to have 
picked up.  Household spending continue s to be the key source of that growth.  This spending 
has been supported by solid increases in household income as well as by relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth.  Business investment, however, remains soft, both in the energy sector an d more broadly.  The energy industry has been hard hit by the drop in oil prices since 
mid-2014, and investment in that sector continued to contract through the first half of the year.  
However, drilling is now showing signs of stabilizing.  Overall, we ex pect that the economy will 
expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.  
Turning to employment, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month over the past four 
months, about the same solid pace recorded since the beginning of the year.  In the longer run, that’s well above the pace that we estimate is needed to provide work for new entrants in the job 
market.  But so far this year, most measures of labor market slack have shown little change.  The unemployment rate in August —4.9 percent —was the same as i n January.  And a broader 
measure of unemployment has also flattened out —a measure that includes people who want and 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 24  
 are available to work but have not searched recently as well as people who are working part time 
but would rather work full time.  The fact  that unemployment measures have been holding steady 
while the number of jobs has grown solidly shows that more people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs.  This is a very welcome development, both for the individuals involved and the nation as a whole.  We continue to expect that labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further over time.  
Ongoing economic growth and an improving job market are key factors suppor ting our 
inflation outlook.  Overall consumer price inflation—as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures —was less than 1 percent over the 12 months ending in July, still short 
of our 2 percent objective.  Much of this shortfall continues to reflect earlier declines in energy and import prices.  Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices that tend to be more 
volatile than other prices , has been running about 1½ percent.  As transitory influences holding 
down inflation fade and as the job market strengthens further, we continue to expect inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next two to three years.  
Our inflation outlook also rests importantly on our judgment t hat longer -run inflation 
expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  However, we can ’t take the stability of longer -
run inflation expectations for granted, and we will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal.  Indeed, we are fully committed to achieving our 
2 percent inflation objective. 
Let me turn to the economic projections —now extending through 2019—that were 
submitted for this meeting by the  Federal Open Market Committee participants.  As always, 
particip ants conditioned their projections on their own view of appropriate monetary policy , 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 24  
 which in turn depends on each participant ’s assessment of the multitude of factors that shape the 
outlook.  The median projection for growth of inflation- adjusted gross domestic product , or 
GDP , is 1.8 percent this year.  This figure is somewhat lower than projected in June as a result of 
the weaker -than-expected growth seen in the first half of the year.  In 2017 and 2018, the median 
growth projection is unchanged at 2 per cent, somewhat higher than the median estimate of 
longer -run normal growth.  In 2019, growth edges down to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated 
longer -run rate, which has als —which  has been revised down a bit since June.  The median 
projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.8  percent at the end of this year, a touch higher 
than in June.  Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs near 4½ percent, 
modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.  Finally, the medi an inflation 
projection is 1.3 per cent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 
and 2019. 
Returning to monetary policy, the recent pickup in economic growth and continued 
progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for  an increase in the federal funds rate.  
Moreover, the Committee judges the risks to the outlook to be roughly balanced.  So why didn’ t 
we raise the federal funds rate at today ’s meeting?  Our decision does not reflect a lack of 
confidence in the economy.  Conditions in the labor market are strengthening, and we expect that to continue.  And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to our 2 percent objective over time.  But with labor market slack being taken up at a somewhat slower pace than in pr evious 
years, scope for some further improvement in the labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we chose  to wait for further evidence of continued 
progress toward our objectives.  This cautious approach to paring  back monetary policy support 
is all the more appropriate given that short -term interest rates are still near zero, which means 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 24  
 that we can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future by 
raising rates than to a weakeni ng labor market and falling inflation by cutting rates.  
We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual 
increases in the federal funds rate over time to achieve and maintain our objectives.  That ’s based 
on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate —that is, the interest rate that is neither 
expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently 
quite low by historical standards.  With the federal funds rate modestly below the neutral rate, the current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives.  But since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of  falling behind the curve in the near future, 
and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.  
This view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetar y policy.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1.1 percent at the end of next year, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent by the end of 2019.  Compared with the projections made in June, the median path for th e federal funds rate has been revised down ¼ to 
½ percentage point.  Most participants also marked down their estimate of the longer -run normal 
federal funds rate, with the median now at 2.9 percent.  
As I have noted on previous occasions, participants ’ projections for the federal funds rate, 
including the median path, are not a fixed plan for future policy.  Policy is not on a preset course.  These forecasts represent participants ’ individual assessments of appropriate policy , given their 
projections of economic growth, employment, inflation, and other factors at a particular point in time.  However, the economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and any assessment of the 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 24  
 appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the ec onomic 
outlook and associated risks. 
Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and 
principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.  As our statement says, we 
anticipate continuing this policy “ until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well 
under way. ”  Maintaining our sizable holdings of longer -term securities should help maintain 
accommodative financial conditions and should reduce the risk that we might have to lower the 
federal funds rate to zero in the event of a future large adverse shock.  
 Thank you.  I ’d be happy to take your questions. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Madam Chair, critics of the Federal 
Reserve have said that you look for any excuse not to hike , that  the goalpost s constantly move.  
And it looks , indeed , like there are new goalposts now  when you say looking for “ further 
evidence ” and—and you suggest that it ’s evidence that labor —labor market slack is “ being taken 
up.”  Could you explain what “for the time being” means , in terms of a time frame , and what that 
further evidence you would look for in order to hike interest rates?  And also, this notion that the goalpost s seem to move , and that you’ve indeed introduced a new goalpost with this  statement.  
Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’ll try to respond to those questions.  Let me try to set out again how 
the C ommittee sees the economy and what we’ re looking for.  We’ re generally pleased with how 
the U.S. economy is doing.  Growth was weak in the first half of the year ; we’re seeing definite 
evidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly.  As I mentioned, payroll gains in recent months have been solid, averaging around 180,000 per month, which is less than the pace in 2015, but , as I mentioned, it ’s well above what ’s needed to provide jobs for new entrants into 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 24  
 the labor force over  time.  The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants ’ 
estimates of its longer -run equilibrium value.  But , as I mentioned, that rate and other measures 
of labor utilization are little change d since the beginning of the year.  I don ’t see that as bad 
news, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the 
labor force back into employment.  The labor force participation rates increased on balance since late last year.  It has —it is on a declining demographic trend, and the fact that it ’s increased 
shows a substantial number of people are being attracted into the labor marke t. 
The employment -to-population ratio has also continued to increase.  Now, we were not 
really certain that this is something that would happen as the labor market strengthened, a nd it’s 
good to see that development has taken place.  And that is some news that we ’ve received in 
recent months , that the labor market does have that potential to have people come back in 
without the unemployment rate coming down.  So we ’re not seeing strong pressures on 
utilization suggesting overheating , and my assessment would be , based on this evidence , that 
the economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought .  That’s 
good news.  
Remember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up 
over time.  So the Committee agrees that risks to the outlook have become roughly balanced.  
We expect labor market conditions to continue strengthening.  And we are generally agreed that 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate to remove what is a modest degree of accommodation will be a ppropriate.  But we don’ t see the economy as overheating now.  My colleagues and I 
exchanged views at this meeting on the appropriate timing of the next step in reducing policy stimulus.  Most of us judged that the case for an immediate increase in the fed eral funds rate is 
stronger, but that it would be sensible , given the finding of a bit more running room , to wait to 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 24  
 see some continued progress —evidence that we continue to progress toward our objectives.  So, 
for the time being, we ’re going to watch incoming evidence , and you can see from the SEP that 
most participants do expect that one increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this 
year.  And I would expect to see that if we continue on the current course of labor market improvement and there are no major new risks that develop and we simply stay on the current course.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Chair, thanks for this.  I 
was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the apparent tension between the stea dy drift 
down in the long -run rate and the steady drift down in some of the projections and the seeming 
march toward a rate hike.  If the neutral rate ’s coming down over time and continues coming 
down and you’ re eating up accommodation that way anyway, why  not wait for the dust to settle 
on that before moving rates up ? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So it is true that our estimates of the neutral rate are coming down , 
and that ’s what ’s largely responsible for that shift.  At the same time, we generally agree that the 
stance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative.  So 180,000 jobs a month is a faster pace of employment growth than  is sustainable in the longer run.  Now, we have seen people 
come into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn ’t fallen.  But that ’s probably not something that is possible without the 
economy overheating on an indefinite basis.  So policy needs to be forward  looking.  We don’ t 
want the economy to overheat and significantly overshoot our 2 percent inflation objective.  That’s one risk that we need to address.  And I think we generally agree that some gradual 
increases to remove that accommodation will be appropriate if we stay on this course .   
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 24  
 But, as I emphasized, it ’s not that much accomm odation, and the economy has shown 
evidence that there are more people who are being attracted back into the labor force.  So , in that 
sense, I would characterize it as , we found the economy has a bit more running room .  
Nevertheless, we don ’t want the economy to overheat , and if things continue on the current 
course, I think that some gradual increases will be appropriate.  And, mainly , what we discussed 
today were issues affecting the timing of such increases.  
MART IN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.  Last month in 
your speech at Jackson Hole, you seemed to raise expectations that there could be a rate hike in 
September.  Other Fed officials talked , including Vice Chairman Fischer .  They seem ed to 
support that.  Fed President Rose ngren had some comments that sent the markets plunging.  
Then we had —Governor Brainard seemed to draw back.  Is this hurting the Fed ’s credibility do 
you think, or is this just a normal thing that we should be looking for at this time —uncertain time 
with the economy?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I did say at Jackson Hole that I thought the case for a rate 
increase had strengthened , and that assessment is included in today ’s statement.  So I think most 
of my colleagues agree—agree with that assessment.  I think we a re trying to understand some 
difficult issues.  There is less disagreement among participants in the C ommittee than you might 
think, listening to speeches and commentary.  I think we all agree that the economy is making 
progress , that  we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that ’s sustainable in the longer 
run.  We all agree we are undershooting our inflation goal , and that we want to make sure we 
stay on a course that raises that to 2 percent.  And we ’re struggling with a difficult set of issues 
about what is the “ new normal ” in this economy and in the global economy more generally , 
which explains why we keep revising down the rate path.  And, you know, it ’s very important 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 24  
 that in a body like ours that a whole range of views a re expressed , that we have independent -
minded people who gather together and discuss these issues.  My colleagues do explain , in their 
individual speeches , their own perspectives.  These are complicated , complex issues , and it just 
isn’t straightforward ex actly how to interpret what is appropriate policy and exactly what is 
going on in the economy.  My —my  sense is that market participants and the public more 
generally learn more about the issues that we’ re grappling with as they listen to th is set of 
speech es.  And I think it ’s a very good thing that the FOMC is not a body that suffers from 
groupthink.  And you see that —you see that ’s one of the, you know, real worries in an 
organization, that everybody thinks identically.  But there ’s a lot that we share in  common and 
express , both in our statement and in our speeches.  And we are debating and discussing issues 
pertaining to timing.  
JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, Donald 
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee , has charged that the Fed is keeping interest rates 
artificially low to support the Obama A dministration.  I’d like to hear what you have to say to 
that charge.  And, on a related note, I wanted to ask you about the Fed ’s next policy meeting , 
which is in e arly November , a week before the next election —given that the case for raising 
rates , you say today , has strengthened, should the public see that November meeting as a live 
meeting when a rate action could happen?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think C ongress very wisely established the Federal Reserve a s 
an independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short -term political pressures.  
And I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the 
appropriate s tance of monetary policy.  We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster 
price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 24  
 affecting the outlook.  We do not discuss politics at our meetings , and we do not take politics 
into account in our decisions. 
As I said, we ’re generally pleased with the progress of the economy.  And the decision 
not to raise rates today and to wait for some further evidence that we ’re continuing on this course 
is largely based on the judgment that we ’re not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating , 
and that we are seeing evidence that people are being drawn in —in larger numbers than at least I 
would have expected —into the labor market , and that that ’s healthy to continue , but th at, 
nevertheless, we do need to be forward looking.  And if we continue along this course, it likely 
will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate.  And November you asked about as well.  
Well, every meeting is live , and we will again assess , as we always do , incoming evidence in 
November and decide whether or not a move is warranted.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Madam Chair, Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  What observable data 
would convince you and the C ommittee that this neutral federal funds rate is starting to move 
up?  There’ s a popular piece of research by one of your colleagues that suggests that it ’s at zero 
right now.  And , second, I ’m struck by your opening remarks that the economy is —isn ’t 
overheating .  But does —does that mean the C ommittee sees this global reach -for-yield going on 
right now as very low  cost to its policy?  Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So you asked, first :  What evidence would suggest that the neutral 
real rate is moving up ?  Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecast s, revising 
down our estimates , well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know , if you saw this, you 
would see revisions in the funds rate path.  But if unemployment were moving down faster than 
we had anticipated , if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be 
suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 24  
 increased.  I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that , while the economy has made a 
lot of progress, it ’s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been 
characterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of 
time.  Let’s see, and then you asked about global factors.  So global factors, capital flows — 
CRAIG TORRES.  —about the global reach -for-yield and whether the C ommittee saw 
that as a cost to its accommodative policy right now.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, in most advanced nati ons now, we have highly accommodative 
policies , and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and 
employment objectives.  And that ’s characteristic of a —an environment in which the neutral 
rate—interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low.  And that is an environment that, if we do have to live with that for a long time, we have to be aware that it does give rise to a reach for yield as individuals and investors seek to, perhaps, take 
on risk or lengthen maturities to seek higher —to seek higher yields.  
And I think we should be concerned about that to the extent it creates financial stability 
risks.  And we are very aware that those are possible.  We engage in regular assessments  of 
financial stability factors that bear on financial stability.  Overall, I would say that the threats to financial stability I would characterize, at this point, as moderate.  Not —I mean —so, I would 
characterize it as moderate.  
In general, I would not s ay that asset valuations are out of line with historical norms, but 
there are areas my colleague President Rosengren has focused on:  commercial real estate, where 
price- to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are very low.  And that ’s something that has caught 
our attention.  We have a variety of tools other than monetary policy to address such risks.  We’ve recently issued new supervisory guidance pertaining to commercial real estate.  I would 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 24  
 say, in the area of commercial real estate , while valuations are high, we are seeing some 
tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real 
estate prices.  But , more generally, we’ re not seeing signs of leverage building up or maturity 
transformati on in the way that we saw in the run -up to the crisis , and we ’re keeping a close eye 
on it. 
SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  Two quasi -related questions.  
One, Bill Dudley earlier this year suggested that political uncertainty in the U .S. may be one of 
the depressants on business investment at the moment.  I wondered if you’ d seen any furt her 
evidence that election risk  was one of the reasons that business es are holding back at the margin. 
A second was a follow -up on your Jackson Hole sp eech where you presented a fairly 
optimistic sense of the scope for further monetary  stimulus.  You did raise the question of 
automatic stabilizers  in the U.S., however .  Are you concern ed that there is in sufficient fiscal 
backup to the F ed, and too much is effectively being lumped on the shoulders of the central b ank 
if there is a fresh downturn?  Thanks.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, starting with the issue of political uncertainty and investment, 
investment spending really has  been quite weak for some time, a nd we ’re really not certain 
exactly what is causing that.  Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spend ing extends 
beyond—beyond that sector, a nd I’m not cer tain of exact ly what explains that, whether —I’m not 
aware of evidence that suggest s that it’ s politica l uncertainty, but it certainly —I would agree 
with the finding that it has been weak.  Consumer sentiment is perfectly solid.  We ’re seeing a lot 
of stren gth in consumer spending, and consumer sentiment certainly seems to be solid. 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 24  
 You asked about scope for further monetary policy action.  I was careful in Jackson Hole .  
I indicated we have a number of tools that we ’ve used before and could use again.  I did indicate 
that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.  N evertheless , at this po int our 
balance sheet is large, and we’ re not at what we see a s the normal level —longer -run level of 
interest rates.  S o, at the mom ent, the funds rate is very low.  It’s below that normal level.  So , at 
the moment , I would say the zero lower bound is a concern, and we have less scope  than I would 
like to see or expect us to have in the longer run.  
Now, I think it would be —it would be  worthwhile for other policy makers to think about 
what role they could play  in addressing negative shocks should they come .  And I mentioned 
specifically automatic stabilizers because I think that ’s an important way in which fiscal policy 
serves to  cushion shocks to the economy .  And it would seem to me, without getting into 
specifics, that there are ways in which the response of fiscal  policy to shifts in the economy 
could be strengthen ed, which would help take s ome burden off monetary policy.  
BINYAMIN APPE LBAUM.   Binya Appelbaum,  the New York Times .  In the run- up to 
the Brexit v ote earlier this year, several Fed policymakers cited it as a reason that they were 
reluctant to raise rates in June because of the uncertainty associ ated with that vote.  In the run- up 
to the president ial election , I have not heard any Fed policy maker give that as a reason that they 
might want to delay raising rates in November.  Could you explain why the  Fed regards Brexit  as 
a greater danger to the American economy than the presidential election  that’s actually 
happening here?   And , second , there were three dissents at this meeting.  C ould you explain what 
the cause of disagreement was , what those policyma kers thought?  
CHA IR YELLEN.  So we  are very focused on evaluating, given the way the economy is 
operating, what is the r ight policy to foster our goals, and I ’m not going to get into politics .  I’m 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 24  
 just—those are factors that we don’ t consider , and I don ’t—I’m not going to get involved in 
commenting on the election. 
In terms of the dissents, a s I indicated , the notion that we do have some accommodation, 
that if we continue on the current path, it ’s something we will need to remove over time.  There ’s 
general agreement among  participants on that, but the preci se timing of what is the right—what 
is the right timing for removing that accommodation is something on which we had active 
discussions , and  there are a range of opinions .  And the dissents represent a judgment on the pa rt 
of some of my colleagues that it’ s important to begin that process now.  
I certainly agree, and I ’ve said myself , that there are risks in waiting to o long to remove 
accommodation, and we need to take a forward -looking approach.  I’ve always advocated 
making policy base d on forecast s of where the economy is heading and taking account of risks.  
And there are two particular risks that we need to think about and balance.  
One is the risk that the economy r uns too hot , that unemploy —the labor market tighten s 
too much, that unemploy ment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less 
gradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that , because that is a very difficult 
thing to accomplish , to gently create a bit more slack in t he labor market, we could cause a 
recession in the process.  And so that ’s something my colleagues and I certainly wouldn’ t want 
to be responsible for.  We would all like to have a very long expansion, with the labor market operat ing well for many years to  come, and the prospect that we could create —create downside 
risk for the labor market is something we would like to avoid, a nd taking “ a stitch in time ” might 
be essential to avoiding that.  
On the other hand, i nflation is running below our 2 percent objec tive, a nd it’s also 
important that we make sure we get  back to 2 percent .  And I have routinely indicated a number 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 24  
 of measures of inflation expectations that are running at the low ends of their historical range , 
and we ’re watching that as well.  And there  would also be risks from not seei ng inflation move 
back to our 2 percent  objective.  And exactly  how to balance these two risks, which is more 
serious —which is a more serious risk—can affect one’ s judgment about the appropriate timing, 
and we ’re all strug gling to understand the magnitude and nature of those two risks. 
REBECCA JARVIS.  Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News.  Chair Yellen, at a time when the 
public is losing faith in many institutions, did the FOMC discuss  the importance of today as an 
opportunity t o dis pel the thinking that the F ed is politically compromised or beholde n to 
markets?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised.  We do not 
discuss politics in our meetings.  I can ’t recall any meeting that I have ever attended where 
politics has been a matter of  discussion.  I think the public, if they had been w atching our 
meeting on TV today, would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about 
the risks an d the forecast s for the economy, a nd we struggled mighti ly with trying to understand 
one another ’s points of view and to come out at a balanc ed place and to act responsibly.  A nd 
that’s my co mmitment to the American people, that I want to lead an ins titution that is not 
political and is —that we are striving to do our very best to pursue the goals the Congress has 
assigned to us, which are important ones of  price stability and maximum employment.  
REBECCA JARVIS.  Does it concern you, given what Donald Trump has said at this 
point about the Feder al Reserve, that he could go back, if he were P resident, and look at the 
minutes and look for signs of the F ed being polit ically motivated and find them?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  I have no concern that the pol —the Fed is politically motivated, a nd I 
will assure that you will n ot find any signs of political motivation when the transcripts are 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 24  
 released in five years.  We —I—it is important that we maintain the confidence of the public, a nd 
I do believe that we deserve it.  I know tha t these are difficult decisions, and everybody m ay not 
agree with them, but I hope the public will understand that we ’re striving to do our best to pursue 
these goals that do matter to all of us.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  You 
mentioned commercial real estate .  Are you worried that bubbles could form in the economy 
because of our prolonged low interest rates?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.  Of course, we —we are worried that bub bles could form in the 
economy, a nd we rout inely monitor asset valuations.  W hile nobody can know for sure what type 
of valuation represents a bubble —that’s only something one can tell in hindsight —we  are 
monitoring these measures of valuation, a nd commercial real estate valuations are high .  Rents 
have moved up over time, but , still, valuations are high relative to rents.  And so it is som ething 
we’ve discussed.  We called this out in our Monetary Policy Report  and in other presentations. 
And we are—we are, in our supervision with banks, as I indicated, w e have issued 
supervisory guida nce to make sure that under writing sta ndards are sound on these loans, and 
we’re aware—t his is something also that we look at in  stress test s of the large—the larger banks 
to see what would happen to their capital positions and to make sure that the y hold sufficient 
capital.  An d, of course, I think the soundness and state of the banking system ha s improved 
substantially , but, of course , we are focused on such things.  
PETER BARNES.  Chair Yellen, over here.  Hi.  Quick question on regulation and the 
scandal  at Wells Fargo over phony customer accounts.  I know that there are other regulators that 
have  looked into this , but you are also a regulator of Wells Fargo.  Have— has the F ed opened  a 
separate investigation into this —these practices at Wells Fargo?  And —and  wouldn’ t you, 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 24  
 because they do involve issues of consumer protection, potentially of risk management and 
corporate governance, and are you looking at  them broadly across the banking system r ight now?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, in this  specific case, the abuses  that occurred took place in a 
national bank.  T he Comptroller of the C urrency has responsibility there.  And on the consumer 
side, it is the CFPB that has responsibility, but we work cooperatively and closely with those 
organizations. 
And in terms of our overall supervisory responsibility for Wells and ot her large banking 
organizations, we are very focused , and this will be a particular focus of our supervision going 
forward over the next year or so on the compliance environment to make sure that the contr ols, 
that the senior management oversight, that the involvement of the boards of directors are appropriate to control these kinds of  risks.   We have been distressed to see banking organizations 
responding when a pa rticular problem arises, a nd what we ’d really want to see is robust 
procedures that ensure that employees are always acting in a legal and ethical manner , and that 
the incentives that are put in place in these organizations are appropriate and don’ t serve to foster 
behav ior that could harm the public .  And this has been and will  be a focus of our supervision.  
JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi.  Jim Tankersley, Washington Post .  Over the past year we ’ve 
seen American policymakers begin to have maybe our most serious discussion about tariffs in the last several decades.  If tariffs were to be enacted in t he coming year or so, does the F ed have 
an opinion on what that would do to growth in America?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, you know, that ’s a political issue that ’s currently being debated 
that I really don ’t want to get into.  You know, s o—I’m going to —I’m going to pass on that one.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi.  John Heltman with American Banker .  Back to a question about 
Wells or related to Wells.  One of the con cerns that has been raised —that this scandal has 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 24  
 raised —is that the bank itself says it doesn ’t know what was happening, a nd there are thousands 
of employees that were involved in this.  Some are calling for a breakup, saying that the banks 
are too big to manage.  Do you think that —leaving aside the question of Wells specificall y, do 
you think that it ’s possible for a bank to get so big that it can’ t be managed , and that perhaps the 
best prudential step would be to break it up?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have hig h expectations for what we expect to  be in place in a 
large organization or in any banking organization.  We expect there to be robust systems of risk management, strong audit functions, a board of directors that is monitoring and supervising and holding s enior management accountable for things that happen throughout the organization in a 
strong c ompliance environment, a nd I don’ t think that these are impossible standards to meet .  
They may be challenging , but I wouldn’ t at this point arrive at the conclusion that just because an 
organization is large , it can ’t live up to those standards .  And those are our expectations , and we 
intend to hold banking organizations responsible for putting in place that kind of —that kind of 
risk-management and complian ce environment.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  So , “No”? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I’m not —I’m not endorsing a general conclusion that banks are —
banks of that size are too big to manage.  I believe they  can be, but it may be challenging , and 
that’s what we expect.  
ERIK SCHATZKER.   Erik Schatzker from Bloomberg Television.  Madam Chair, thank 
you.  I have a question about the rate trajectory  the Fed outline d today in the dot  plot.  While 
there is clearly a wide range, the median expectation is for the fed funds  target  to rise by 
½ percentage point in 2017, ¾ of a point in 2018, and a further ¾ of a point in 2019, bringing us to 2½ to 2¾ percent , and then 2¾ percent to 3 percent  in the long run.  At the same time, the 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 24  
 median forecast for  GDP growth is 2 percent for the next two years  and 1.8 percent  thereafter.  
And, I should add, the most optimistic proje ction is for growth of just 2½ percent  of all the 
projections outlined here.  So if economic growth is going to be that slow for that long, where 
will the inflationary forces emerge that would require tightening of 250 basis points from where we are now?  And if not inflation, is there some other explanation?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the projections —I agree , the projections for growth are slow.  We 
have further written down our estimate of the longer -run normal gro wth rate.  And what that 
reflects is  an assessment that productivity growth is likely to remain low for an extended time , 
although it does  embody an  expectation that it will pick up from the miserable ½ percent pace 
per year that we have seen over the last five years.  
Now, why we would never —and slow growth is a factor.  Slow productivity growth is a 
factor that influences the longer -run normal level of interest rates , and writing down the likely 
pace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate.  That ’s an important reason for revising down the neutral 
rate. 
But now, let ’s go to your —the part of your question about inflation.  In spite of having 
such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated a n average of about 230,000 jobs a month a nd so far this year has been generating 
about 180,000 jobs a month.  And that is a  very solid pace of job growth and a pace that likely is 
not sustainable in the longer run, a lthough we ’ve been pleased to see people come back in the 
labor market.  So it certainly is sustainable for some further amount of time.  
But I think what ultimatel y drives inflation, both wage and price growth, is that tightness 
in the labor market and pressure on resource utilization.  And the sad fact is that we are getting 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 24  
 that healthy pace of job market growth with very slow growth in output.  So this is —I don’ t 
think it bears on the inflation outlook.  I t has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for 
the neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity 
growth ultimately means slow growth in living standards.  An d that ’s a big concern that 
policymakers should be focused on.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Back to Wells Fargo .  You 
know, obviously, this was more of a consumer finance kind of a question, but I ’m wondering if 
you think it does pos e safety and soundness questions, if  something like this is widespread ac ross 
a big bank.  And you had  mention ed that this is going to be a supervisory focus over the coming 
year.  Are there any adjustments that you can speak to that might be warranted , given these 
revelations?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, as I mentioned, we are going to be focusing on compliance ris k 
management and board oversight  not only  at Wells, but also across bank holding companies.  Of 
course, consumer issues and issues that involve harm of consumers can become safety and soundness issues.  And if there was —at least one of the lessons from the financial crisis , I think, 
is that abuses of consumers of the  sort that we see —saw in subprime lending ultimately did 
become—become safety and soundness issues.  And so, of course, we need to have that concern, and we ’ll focus there.  I think— I can ’t really at this point give you specifics beyond that. 
MICHAEL  DERBY.  Hi , Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  A large number of 
congressional Democrats a s well as the campaign of Hillary Clinton would like bankers removed 
from the boards overseeing the regional F ed banks.  Also, other reformers would like to see the 
private ownership of the regional —the bank ownership of the regional Feds ended and that the 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 24  
 regional F eds be brought fully into government , and I wanted to know what you thought of those 
two proposals. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have a system that Congress did set up in the Federal Reserve 
Act in which the governance of the Reserve B anks involves banks contributing capital and 
serving on the boards of directors.  We have long recognized inside the Federal Reserve that 
when we ’re charged with supervision of banks , having banker s involved in that obviously 
presents conflict of interest.   And we have put in place very strong measures to ensure that those 
conflicts of interest are not allowed to play out in any —in any way, that bankers are not allowed 
to be involved in supervision.  Dodd- Frank changed the arrangement so that only the C lass B and 
C, or nonbanking , directors can participate in the selection of the president as well.  
So I think— I want to make sure the public has confidence that , in spite of the fact th at we 
do have this banker involvement in our boards of directors , that it is  not giving rise to any 
conflicts in our actual conduct of policy.  Now, that setup—if that setup is changed, it raises  
which —it’ s up to Congress to decide what to do here.  It raises complex issues about the 
governance —the whole governance arrangement in the R eserve Banks in the Federal Reserve, 
and I would simply caution that if that is looked at, as Congress is entitled to do, that they think through carefully what the ramifications of making changes would be.  
KAREN MRACEK.  Karen Mracek  with Market News International.  You mentioned in 
a previous answer the need to be forward looking , but you’ ve also pointed to the economy not 
overheating as a reason you could, you know, hold off on raising rates at this one.  Monetary policy ha s traditionally operated with long and variable lags.  Do you think this timeline has 
changed since the financial crisis or due to the u se of unconventional tools that the F ed used , and 
how does that factor into your decisionmaking?  
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 24  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think the notion that monetary policy operates with long and 
variable lags —that statement is due to Milton Friedman , and it is one of the ess ential things to 
understand about  monetary policy , and it ha s not fundamentally change d at all.  And that is why 
I believe we h ave to be forward  looking , and I ’m not in favor of a  “whites of their eyes ” sort of 
approach.  We need to operate based on forecasts.  
But the global economy and the U .S. economy have changed a lot.  History doesn ’t 
always exactly replay itself.  Many of th e—those of us sittin g around the table, we learned the  
lesson that if policy is not forward  looking, that inflation can pick up t o highly undesirable 
levels , that inflation expectations can be dislodged upward, and the consequence of that can be 
that, endemically , higher inflation takes place , which —it is very costly to reduce.  And 
absolut ely none of us want to relive a n episode like that.  And so I believe , and my colleagues , 
that it is important to be forward  looking.  We ’re not going to make that mistake again.  
But the structure of the economy changes, things do change.  The nature of the inflation 
process ha s changed , I think , significantly  since the bad days of the ’ 70s when the Fed had to 
face this chronic high -inflation  problem.  We ’ve seen infl ation respond less to the economy, to 
movements in the unemployment rate —that ’s sometimes sa id, “The Phillips curve has become 
flatter. ”  So we ’ve seen less of a response .  That’s something we need to factor into our 
decisionmaking.  Inflation expectations  appear to be better anchored, and perhaps that ’s been a 
result of a long period of low and stable inflation.  That’s an asset .  It’s something we didn’ t have 
in the 1970s.  And , in addition, we have to be attentive to the fact there we ’ve now had a long 
period in which inflation is actually undershooting our 2 percent  objective.  And we see some 
signs that I —we conclude  inflation expectations are reasonably well  anch ored at 2  percent.  But 
we are seeing signs suggesting possible slippage there , and we ’re a long way from being —facing 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 24  
 the problems that Japan faces.  But there always a remi—should be a reminder to us that we also 
would not want to find ourselves in a period where inflation is chronically low—running below 
our objective , inflation expectations are slipping .  And with a low neutral rate , that becomes 
more important.  So things are changed, but the principle of “ forward  looking ” absolutely hold s. 
PATRICK GILLESPIE.  Hi, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  Chair Yellen, you just 
mentioned one of the economy ’s major problems :  low productivity growth.  And one of the 
solutions that ’s been proposed widely is better job skills.  Many economists  say that some 
workers are staying on the sidelines because they don’ t—they, you know, they lack new job 
skills, the ones that would help them obtain better employment.  The Fed doesn ’t have the 
authority to finance or run its own  job training program or apprenticeship, but would you want 
that authority from Congress ?  And is it at all frustrating that you know —you and your 
colleagues know one of the solutions to fixing a major issue in the economy , but you can’ t take 
the concrete steps to solving that issue ? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well , I do think job training and job skills are important.  And we do 
work in community developme nt, trying to —in the local  communities where the Reserve B anks 
operate, to try to foster broader understanding of what kinds of programs work and how 
community organizations in state and local governments can put in place programs that will be helpful.  I’ve recently visited a program that was very impressive in Philadelphia .  I’ve visited 
some in Chicago and other places.  So I do believe it ’s possible to design programs that will help 
people overcome obstacles in getting jobs that are available.  But I de finitely think that, you 
know, while we can play some role in facilitating understanding of what works and what doesn ’t 
work that can be helpful, it ’s certainly worthwhile for policymakers at the federal level, at state 
September 21, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 24  
 and local levels , to be focusing on this , becau se I think it is an area that would be helpful in 
making progress. 
MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you, Madam Chair, Mark Hamrick with B ankrate.com.  As 
we’ve gotten to this 4.9 percent  unemployment rate, as you know , through this year ’s long 
recovery, we have yet to see substantial pickup in wage growth.  And it seems as if the American 
middle class  continues to express some disappointment about that.  Is there better news on the 
horizon?  Do you think it could come in 2017, for example, and if not, when?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I th ink we have seen some modest pickup in wage growth.  It’s 
running a li ttle bit higher than it was over the last two years by a number of important measures.  
And we have seen income growth pick up recently.  I think the C ensus report was encouraging, 
showing that there are income gains , both because of more jobs and higher -paying jobs , and that 
that’s occurring throughout the income distribution.  I t’s helping many families.  But I do 
expect —we expect the unemployment rate to decline f urther , we expect labor market conditions 
to continue to improve .  And my hope and expectation is that we will see some further pickup in 
wage growth , and that  it will be broadly beneficial to American households.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
December 14, 2016  
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided 
to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ½ to 
¾ percent.  In doing so, my colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the 
economy has made toward our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Over the past year, 2 ¼ million net new jobs have been created, unemployment has fallen fu rther, 
and inflation has moved closer to our longer -run goal of 2 percent.  We expect the economy will 
continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further and inflation rising to 2 percent over the next couple of years.  I ’ll have more to s ay about monetary policy shortly, but 
first I ’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook. 
Economic growth has picked up since the middle of the year.  Household spending 
continues to rise at a moderate pace, supported by income gains and by rel atively high levels of 
consumer sentiment and wealth.  Business investment, however, remains soft despite some stabilization in the energy sector.  Overall, we expect the economy will expand at a moderate 
pace over the next few years.  
Job gains averaged ne arly 180,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the 
solid pace that we ’ve seen since the beginning of the year.  Over the past seven years, since the 
depths of the Great Recession, more than 15 million jobs have been added to the U.S. econom y.  
The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, the lowest level since 2007, prior to the recession.  Broader measures of labor market slack have also moved lower, and participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about t wo years now, a further sign of 
improved conditions in the labor market given the underlying downward trend in participation 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 20  
 stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population.  Looking ahead, w e expect that job 
conditions will strengthen somewhat furt her. 
Turning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures was nearly 1 ½ percent in October, still short of our 2 percent objective but up more 
than a percentage point from a year earlier.  Core inflation—which excludes energy and food 
prices that tend to be more volatile than other prices —has risen to 1¾ percent.  As the transitory 
influences of earlier declines in energy prices and prices of imports continue to fade and as the job market strengthens further, we  expect overall inflation to rise to 2 percent over the next 
couple of years. 
Our inflation outlook rests importantly on our judgment that longer -run inflation 
expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  Market -based measures of inflation 
compensation have moved up considerably but are still low.  Survey -based measures of longer -
run inflation expectations are, on balance, little changed.  Of course, we remain committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and will continue to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward this goal.  
Let me now turn to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by 
Committee participants.  As always, they conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s assessment of 
the multitude of factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for growth of inflation-adjusted gross domestic product rises from 1.9 percent this year to 2.1 percent in 2017 and stays close to 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate.  The median 
projection for the unemployment rate stands at 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year.  
Over the next three years, the median unemployment rate runs at 4.5 pe rcent, modestly below the 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 20  
 median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 
1.5 percent this year and rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  Overall, 
these economic projections are very sim ilar to those made in September:  GDP growth is a touch 
stronger ; the unemployment rate is a shade lower ; and inflation, beyond this year, is unchanged.  
Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal 
funds rate is appropriate in l ight of the solid progress we have  seen toward our goals of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  We continue to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to achi eve and 
maintain our objectives.  That ’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate —
that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently quite low by hist orical standards.  With the federal funds 
rate only modestly below the neutral rate, we continue to expect that gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.  
This view is co nsistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate rises to 1.4 percent at the end of next year, 2.1 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.9 percent by the end of 2019.  Compared with the projections made in September, the median path for the federal funds rate has been revised up just ¼ percentage point.  Only a few participants altered their estimate of the longer -run normal 
federal funds rate, although the median edged up to 3 percent.  
Of course, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their 
assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks.  As many observers have noted, changes  in fiscal policy 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 20  
 or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook.  Of course, it is far too 
early to know how these policies will unfold.  Moreover, changes in fiscal policy are only one of the many factors that can influence the outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy.  In making our policy decisions, we will continue —as always —to assess economic conditions 
relative to our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  As I have noted on previous occasions, policy is not on a preset course. 
Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and 
principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.  As our statement says, we 
anticipate continuing this policy “ until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well 
under way. ” 
Thank you.  I ’d be happy to take your questions. 
HARRIET TORRY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Harriet Torry with the Wall Street 
Journal.  Why does the Fed now see three rate increases next year instead of two?  Is it because the economy is at risk of overheating , or is the Fed behind the curve , or is this a reaction to 
Donald Trump’ s election?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I would like to emphasize that this is a very modest adjustment 
in the path of the federal funds rate and involves changes by only, you know, some of, you know, some of the participants.  So in thinking about the paths and the revisions, there are a number of 
factors that were taken into account by participants.  The unemployment rate is perhaps a touch, as I said, a touch lower than previously ; you’ve seen some modest downward revisions in that —
in that  projection.  For this year, there was a slight u pward revision to inflation, and some of the 
participants , but not all of the participants , did incorporate some assumption of a change in fiscal 
policy into their projections.  And that may have been a factor that was one of several that 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 20  
 occasioned  these shifts, but I want to emphasize that these —the shifts that you see here are really 
very tiny.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  In recent testimony, you said your advice 
was for fiscal authorities to increase the productive capacity of the economy.  Do  individual and 
business tax cuts increase the productive capacity of the economy?  And how would the F ed’s 
reaction be different to fiscal policies that increase the productive capacity of the economy and 
those that don’ t? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the statement that I made , that  it would be useful to increase the 
productive capacity of the economy , reflects my concern that productivity growth has been very 
low.  It’s the ultimate determination of the evolution of living standards.  Policies that would 
improve productivity growth would include policy changes that enhance education, training, workforce development ; policies that spur either private or public investment to enhance the 
quality of capital in the United States that workers have to work with;  and policie s that spur 
innovation or competition or the formation of new firms.  So tax policies can have that e ffect.  It 
really depends on the specifics.  I don’ t think there ’s anything that I could say in general about 
what tax policy would do , but that —and I really can ’t tell you what the F ed’s response would be 
to any policy changes that are put into effect.  I wouldn’ t want to speculate until I  were more 
certain of the details and how they would affect the likely course of the economy.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Okay.  A quick follow -up— I’m sorry , but if there was a rush of 
fiscal policy that did not increase the productive capacity of the economy, would that mean the Federal Reserve would have to move more quickly with raising rates?  
CHAIR YELLEN. I—you know, it ’s some thing I really just can ’t generalize about 
because, w hile it would be desirable to have tax policies that do increase the productive capacity 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 20  
 of the economy , an increase in the pace of productivity change is one of the factors  that does 
affect the economy ’s neutral rate.  A  boost to prod uctivity could spur investment .  As we have 
been saying , we estimate that the value of the neu tral federal funds rate is quite  low—has —and 
one of the reasons for that is s low productivity growth.  And so it ’s very hard to ge neralize about 
it because it could affect that neutral rate.  
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times.   For the average 
American, can you explain what the impact of this hike and three additional hikes will be next 
year?  And should they feel more confident in the economy now that you are raising rates at  a 
slightly faster pace?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me say that our decision to raise rates is —should certainly be 
understood as a reflection of the confi dence we have in the pr ogress  the economy has made and 
our judgment that that progress will continue .  And the economy ha s proven to be remarka bly 
resilient.  So it is a vote of  confidence in the economy.  As you know, this was a decision that 
was well anticipated in markets , and I think it will have relatively small effect on market rates.  It 
could boost very slightly some short -term interest rates that could have an effect on borrowing 
costs that are linked to them, but , overall, I think that households and firms will see very  modest 
changes from this decision.  But , certainly, it’ s important for households and businesses to 
understand that my colleagues and I have judged the course of the U .S. economy to be strong , 
that we ’re making progress toward our inflation and unemployme nt goals.  We have a  strong 
labor market , and we have a resilient economy.  
SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.   Clearly, there’ s been a lot of 
discussion already about fiscal —fiscal policy.  But even if you discount or don’ t know what the 
fiscal outlook is going to be next year, unemployment is already below the longer -run projection 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 20  
 under the policy rule you cited in your August speech.  That would suggest that policy ought to 
be tighter.   Is there a risk that the Federal Reserve is alread y behind the curve , even before any 
fiscal impact steps in next year?  Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would agree that —and as  we said in our statement —policy 
remains accommodative.  The degree of accommodation I would characterize as moderate.  As I’ve emphas ized and said in the statement, we currently judge the neutral level of the federal 
funds rate to be pretty low.  So there is some accommodation.  Remember that inflation is still below our objective.  The C ommittee projects —at least the median projection shows a very 
modest undershoot of estimates  of the longer -run normal rate of unemployment.  The median 
unemployment rate here gets down to 4½ percent, which is just a few tenths below the estimated longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate.  And we think that that ’s appropriate because 
we want inflation to rise to our 2 percent  objective in a timely fashion.  
So there is not a substantial undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment.  We ’re not 
seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.  So I do not j udge  that we are behind the curve.  I’ve—my 
judgment is that we ’re on a good path  to reaching our objectives.  But , of course , the outlook is 
uncertain.  We recognize that there are many sources of uncertainty affecting the outlook.  And we will have to ad just our thinking as things evolve, as conditions —conditions evolve, and we 
learn more about economic policy changes that could affect the outlook. 
JIM TANKERSLEY.  Jim Tankersley , Washington Post.  I’m curious, you and your 
predecessor had both at times c alled for more fiscal stimulus to help with the outlook, the growth 
outlook.  And I ’m wondering , how much do you judge the economy has capacity for fiscal 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 20  
 stimulus right now?  It’s a version of Steve ’s question, but I think we ’re trying to get at, how 
much  can happen before we run that risk of overheating?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I believe my predecessor and I called for fiscal stimulus when 
the unemployment rate was substantially higher  than it is now.  So, with a 4.6 percent  
unemployment and a solid labor ma rket, there may be some additional slack in labor markets , 
but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished.  So I would say at this point that fiscal 
policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment.  But , 
nevertheless, let me be careful that I  am not trying to provide advice t o the new A dministration 
or to Congress as to what is the appropriate stance of policy.  There are many considerations th at 
Congress needs to take account of and many bases for justif ying changing fiscal policy.  I’ve 
continued to highlight the importance of spurring productivity growth, that I think that would be something that ’s beneficial for the economy.  Of course , it’s also important for Congress to take 
account of the fact that , as our population ages , that the debt -to-GDP ratio is projected to rise , 
and that needs to continue to be taken into account.  And so there are many factors that I think should enter into such decisions. 
CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Chair 
Yellen, you’ve just spoken about some of the risks —the inflationary risks of running in this 
expansionary fiscal policy.  But in October you were wondering whether it might be possible to 
repair some of the damage done to the labor force during the recession by running what you termed a “ high-pressure economy .”  So I ’m wondering, why couldn’ t fiscal policy serve the 
same end in seeking to run a high- pressure economy , hoping to draw more Americans off the 
sidelines and into the workforce?  Is there something necessarily riskier about approaching it 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 20  
 from the fiscal side , or perhaps have you become less enthusiastic about the idea of running a 
high-pressure economy?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I want to be clear that what I said in that speech in Boston is that 
an important research question is whether or not , in an economy with a very strong labor market , 
there might be changes that took place that permanently raised the labor force participation , 
training , and other thing s of the labor —of the labor force that would be positives for the 
productive potential of our economy on a long -lasting basis.  I never said that I favor running a 
high-pressure economy.  And, you know, as you can see in the SE P projections of the 
particip ants—and this has long been true not just in this forecast , but in earlier ones as well —you 
see a modest undershooting.  The under —unemployment rate is projected to modestly 
undershoot , for several years, levels that are deemed to be normal in the longer r un.  T hat’s an 
appropriate policy  purely on the grounds that inflation is running below our objective.  And 
while we do n’t want to overshoot our 2 percent  objective, we also don’ t want a  persistent 
undershoot of our 2 percent  objective, and that does  invol ve a labor market that may succeed in 
attracting more people off the sidelines into the labor market.  I t’s something we will see as we 
examine experience over the next couple of years.  We may adjust our views on this .  But I do 
want to make clear that I have not recommended running a “hot” economy as some sort of 
experiment.  
LINDSAY DUNSMUIR.  Hi, Lindsay Dunsmuir with Reuters.  How comfortable are 
you with possible interference on Fed policy by the incoming P resident?  And I ’m talking there 
about the negative impacts  his tweets on aerospace companies in the last week have had on their 
share prices.  And do you feel having a P resident tweeting about individual companies —do you 
feel that that could begin to distort corporate decisionmaking?  
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 20  
 CHAIR YELLEN.   Well, I ’m not going to offer the incoming P resident advice about how 
to conduct himself in policy.  I’m a strong believer in the independence of the Fed.  We have 
been given the independence by Congress to make decisions about monetary policy in pursuit of 
our dual -mandate objectives of maximum employment and inflation , and that is what I intend to 
stay focused on.  T hat’s what the C ommittee is focused on.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum  with the New York Times.   The 
President -elect has said that overhauling financial regulation is a high priority for him.  I’m 
curious whether the Fed has been asked to provide any advice on how that might be done , and 
what advice you would provide to the P resident -elect about how our financial regulatory system 
should be improved?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have been —our staff have been in touch with the Trump 
transition team.  A nd we , of course , share the objective that the  whole government has to work 
constructively to ensure a smooth transition.  I’ve not been in touch beyond that , and it ’s not 
something that I would expect.  But —I’m sorry , so what  would I — 
BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM.  I was saying, what advice would you give a bout how the 
system should be improved?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  About how — 
BINYAMIN APPLEBAUM.  —on financial re gulation.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  —the f inancial rate.   Yes.  So, okay, on financial regulation, I feel 
that we live d through a  devastating financial crisis that took a huge toll on our economy.  And 
most members of Congress and the public came away from that exper ience feeling that it was 
important to take a set of steps that would result in a safer and stronger financial system.  And I 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 20  
 feel that we have done that.  That has been our mission since the financial crisis for the last six or 
seven years.  That ’s what Dodd- Frank was designed to do. 
I think it ’s very important that we have reduced the odds that a systemically important 
firm could fail by requiring higher capital, higher liquidity , by performing stress tests that 
provide us another way of e nsuring that th e firms we count on to supply credit to households and 
businesses would be able to go on doing that even in the face of a severely adverse shock.  The firms —the largest firms have a great deal more capital than they did before the crisis.  Those are 
import ant changes.  We have placed the toughest regulations on those firms that are systemically 
important.  I would advise that —and we have been trying to do this —that it’ s important to look 
for ways to relieve regulatory burden on community banks and smaller i nstitutions , to tailor 
regulation so that it’ s appropriate for the systemic risk profile of the particular institutions.  
I think there was broad  agreement also that we s hould end “ too bi g to fail,”  and that 
means not only reducing the odds of the failure of a systemically important institution , but also 
making sure that , should such a firm fail , that it could be resolved in an orderly way.  And the 
living wills process has been about that , and I think we ’ve made considerable progress in making 
sure that the  largest and most systemic firms conduct their businesses in a day -to-day way with 
some thought about —with important  thinking in place about whether or not the way they are 
conducting their business would aid resolution in the event that they encountered a  severe 
negative shock.  So this is progress , I would say , it’s very important not to roll back.  There may 
be some changes that could be made, and we ’ve suggested a few , like eliminating the burden of 
compliance with the Volcker  rule, or incentive compensation, regulations for smaller banks , or 
modestly raising the threshold for banks that are subject to enhance d prudential supervision.  But 
I would urge that it ’s important to keep this in place. 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL

 MARTIN CRUTSINGER.   Marty Crutsinger with the Associa ted Press.  The election of 
Donald Trump seem ed to have sparked a major reaction in financial markets :  stock prices at 
record highs, the dollar has strengthened, long -term interest rates are higher.  The —did any of 
that get discussed in the meeting and di d it—do you feel that it will have any effect, either 
negative or positive , on things?  And also, did you have any broader discussion about Trump’ s 
economic plan and what it might do and how the Fed might have to react?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we did discuss the se topics in our meeting today.  I would simply 
summarize by saying that all the  FOMC participants recognize that  there is considerable 
uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the 
economy.  And in so far as that  will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor 
those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters.  We will have to factor that into our outlook and figure out what is an appropria te 
response.  But we ’re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment , and we have time to 
wait to see what changes occur and to factor those into our decisionmaking as we gain greater clarity.  
You mentioned the market moves.  So I see the market mo ves as implicit forecast s about 
what impact these policies are likely to have on the economy.  The changes —the financial 
market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer -term rates , and the strengthening of the dollar , suggest that many market participants 
anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rate s somewhat in the United 
States relative to abroad and would cause a  strengthening in the dollar.  But market participants 
were uncertain too, and I would expect changes in our understanding of what is going to happen to also affect market prices in financial markets as we move forward.  
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL

 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Nanc y Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  
Wondering  about slack, when do you think the slack in the labor market will have work ed its 
way through so we ’re no longer talking about it at press conferences and it ’s not such a big 
issue?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So this is not something that it ’s possible to judge preci sely.  My 
colleagues write down their best estimates of a normal longer -run unemployment rate.  The 
median stands at 4.8 percent, so we ’re close, possibly —the unemployment rate right now is ever 
so slightly below , but in the nei ghborhood.  If we look at la rger, broader mea sures of slack , like 
the U -6 measure that includes involuntary part -time employment and those who are marginally 
attached to the labor force, t hey’re slightly higher than pre -recession levels, but they ’ve come 
down considerably.  We look a t a broad array of i ndicators of the labor market, a nd if you look at 
job openings or the hires  rate or the quits  rate or difficulty of hiring workers as reported in 
business surveys, you know, I would say the labor market looks a lot like the way it did before 
the recession , that it’ s—we’re roughly comparable to 2007 levels when we thought the, you 
know, there was a normal amount of slack in the labor market.  The labor market was in the vicinity of maximum employment.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  Given 
President -elect Trump ’s criticism of your low -rate policy during the campaign, like it or not, 
market participants are going to focus a lot in 2017 on you.  You ’ve suggested you will serve out 
your term, but I ’m curious if that statement still holds , if you would like another term as Fed 
Chair, if you would accept another term as Fed C hair, and would you stay on the C ommittee if 
you were not Fed C hair?  
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 20  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I guess the way I think about it is that I was confirmed by the 
Senate to a four -year term.  The term of the Fed Chair was not meant to coincide with that of the 
President , and there were good reasons for that , too.  It’s part of ensuring the independe nce of the 
Fed.  And so I do intend to serve out my four -year term.  I haven ’t made any decision about the 
future .  I, you know, I recognize I might or might not be reappointed.  It’s a decision that I don’ t 
have to make and don’ t, you know, don ’t have thoughts on at this time.  And , as you said, I 
recognize too that I could stay on as a Board member, and that ’s a decision for another day.  
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Just to follow up on Marty ’s question 
about the financial markets , the Dow is about to hit 20,000.  It’s up substantially since the 
election on, apparently, investor optimism about potential —the impact of President -elect 
Trump ’s policies on the economy and an improving economy.  I wonder if you share that 
optimism, number one, and, if not, are we seeing a bout of, perhaps, irrational exuberance right 
now?  Or are you concerned at all about a bubble in equity  prices that could create some 
financial instability in the economy?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, you know, I really don ’t want to comment on the level of stock 
prices .  They may have been boosted by expectations about tax policy ; possible cuts in corporate 
tax rates that have been much discussed ; or by expectations about growth, possible reductions , 
and downside risk to the economy.  But, you know, these are things tha t market participants are 
trying to view , along with the likely path of —paths of interest rates, and I think all of that factors 
into movements and stock valuations.  But I don’t—I don ’t want to offer a view as to whether 
they’re appropriate . 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 20  
 PETER BARNES.  You have said—mentioned— can I just follow up?   On equity prices, 
you have talked about whether or not the valuations are still —are within historical ranges and 
norms.  Did —is Dow 20,000 kind of within historical norms?  Are you comfortable w ith that?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think rates of return in the stock market relative to —
remember that the level of interest rates is low , and , taking that into account, I believe it’ s fair to 
say that they remain within normal ranges.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  John He ltman of American Banker.   You said that much progress 
has been made since the crisis in making the banks more secure, more safe, higher liquidity, 
capital levels, et cetera.  Does that feeling extend to the culture of the banks, the way that they 
run, the  way that they operate in their approach towards —towards business?  Do you think that 
more needs to be done there?  Do you expect that if there has been improvement, that it will continue to be —that culture will continue to improve in the next A dministration and  the next 
Congress?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, there have been many ways in which there have been 
compliance failures at large organizations , and you’ ve seen a series of enforcement actions by 
the banking regulators over a range of practices that suggest s some breakdown of compliance or 
culture, whether it involves violations of sanctions or foreign exchange or LIBOR or other matters.  So this is something that we ’ve discussed and emphasized, the importance of a culture 
of compliance.  And the B oard will b e undertaking review.  We ’ve already beg un this year , 
broadly , of compliance and management of compliance risk in the largest corporations .  So I 
think this is something that’ s important.  And the failings that we have seen in a number of 
institutions sugg est there is certainly room for improvement.  
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 20  
 GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I’d like to —two questions , if I might—
follow up on the question about running the economy hot that you mentioned in your speech up 
in Boston a couple months ago.  You brought it up .  Are you now sort of distancing yourself 
from the idea?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I want to make clear what I said and what I didn ’t say.  One of 
the things we ’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history 
and around the globe is that , very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a 
recession, that productivity doesn’ t pick up to pre -recession levels and that there looks like there 
is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy , which is called “ hysteresis. ”  
And I raise d the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.  
We have seen quite a few people who lost their jobs duri ng the G reat R ecession drop out of the 
labor force  and, you know, lose their ties and become discouraged and not reenter.  And I raised 
the question a s to whether or not hysteresis could operate in the opposite direction.  And that was 
a research question for economist s to see if there is any evidence, because it could be important 
in determining policy.  But I didn’t —I didn’ t draw any policy conclusions from that.  And , as I 
indicated, I think the path that you see —that the Committee has laid out in a tentative way that 
involves a modest degree of undershooting of normal longer -run levels of unemployment going 
down to around 4½ percent would remain for a couple of years —might provide some insight.  So 
I was not recommending a substantially easier policy in order to test that hypothesis. 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I guess my question to—that I had before that 
follow -up was, both times you’ ve raised rates in this cycle, t he market expectations o f a rate hike 
have been over 50 percent.  The market has, you know, kind of priced it in.  Is that a prerequ isite 
going forward?  Will that have to happen as you go forward?  
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 20  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  It’s not a prerequisite , but we do try to explain our evolving views  as 
clearly as we can.  It’s important for market participants to have a sense of how we think about 
the economy and the appropriate path of policy , to look at incoming data , and to form their own 
judgments as to whether or not changes in policy would be appropriate.  And while  it’s not a 
prerequisite , if we ’re in good sync in terms of explaining what goes into our policy judgments , 
it’s not surprising that it would often be true that moves are well anticipated by the market.  As I 
said, in thinking about today ’s move, we ’ve indicated that we thought we  were making progress 
on our objectives.  We wanted to see some more.  I think anyone looking at incoming data can 
clearly see that we have enjoyed further progress both in the labor market and on inflation.  And , 
therefore, there are good reasons why the market should have antic ipated a moved today.  
PATRICK GILL ESPIE.  Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  There ’s been a lot of 
discussion about manufacturing jobs and trade.  I’m wondering, what do you think are two or 
three concrete steps that could be taken to increase manufacturing employment in the United  
States?  And , separately, I ’ve asked you about the importance of job training program s, 
something that you’ ve emphasized.  Specifically, what  do you think about the worker  assistance 
provided to workers who lose their jobs to trade, both the financial ass istance and the worker 
retraining programs?  Are they sufficient?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So , I don’ t want to weigh in.  I don’ t intend to weigh in.  I haven ’t 
weighed in on either fiscal policy , specifics of evaluating policies.  I’m not going to weigh in 
either on the details of particular trade policies.  But, more generally, I ’d say , you asked me 
about manufacturing.  There were a lot of manufacturing jobs lost over a long period of time and 
particularly after —during the G reat R ecession.  We’ve had some recovery in manufacturing 
employment as the econom y’s recovered.  So, to some extent, manufacturing employment 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 20  
 depends on the progress of the economy, and we have seen some recovery.  Over a long period  
of time, technological change  is something that has been important in reducing manufacturing 
employment absolutely and as  a share of jobs in the economy.  For decades, the pace of 
technological change in manufacturing has outstripped that in the economy as a whole.  And , so, 
firms —man ufacturing firms have found it easier to continue producing by —with reducing their 
workforces.  And that ’s a change that I would expect to continue.  
You mentioned worker assistance.  So some of the forces that are acting on 
manufacturing and other sectors , including technological change and globalization—e ven though 
most economists would judge the overall consequences of these developments for the economy 
to be positive, certainly there are groups of workers who were harmed by developments pertaining to glo balization and technology.  And I think most economists and policymakers 
recognize that it ’s important to provide ways for workers who were harmed by these kinds of 
developments to be retrained for jobs so that they can succeed in the economy.  And so, I m ean, I 
would agree —without getting into any particular program and whether it’ s sufficient , I do think 
that it’ s important to recognize there are those who were harmed by these developments , and 
their concerns, I think, need to be addressed by policymaker s, certainly.  
JUSTINE UNDERHILL.  Justine Underhill, Yahoo Finance.  So the F ed’s balance sheet 
has grown to over $4 trillion.  And as the Fed begins removing policy accommodation, under what circumstances would you see the Fed removing or possibly winding down its  balance sheet  
in either letting mature —securities mature or possibly outright selling bonds from the  SOMA 
portfolio?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we ’ve indicated in our normalization principles that we expect to 
diminish the size of our portfolio over time l argely by ceasing reinvestments of principal rather 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 20  
 than by selling securities.  We ’ve indicated that once the process of normalization of the federal 
funds rate is well under way, we would probably begin to allow our portfolio to run off.  We ’ve 
not yet m ade any precise decisions about when that will occur.  We want to feel that if the 
economy w ere to suffer an adverse shock, that we have some scope through traditional means of 
interest rate cuts to be able to respond to that.  Now, there’ s no mechanical r ule about what level 
of the federal funds rate we might deem appropriate to begin that process.  It’s not something 
that only depends on the le vel of the federal funds rate .  It also depends on our judgment of the 
amount of momentum in the economy and poss ible concerns about downside risks to  the 
economy.  So we ’ve not yet made this decision, but it is something that we have long planned, to 
begin to allow our balance sheet to run off.  And then it would take several years.  And we would 
end up, if all goes well, with a  substantially smalle r balance sheet than we have at  present.  
MICHAEL  DERBY.  Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  I wonder ed if the 
unexpected outcome of the election and the sense that a lot of people are really upset with how the economy is performing despite having, you know, aggregate economic statistics that look 
pretty good—i s that causing you in any way to think differently about how you evaluate the 
economy, like what sort of things you look for to get a sense of what ’s going on in the economy ?  
Is—you know, basically, did how things turned  out in  the election —is it making you think 
differently about how you evaluate the economy ’s performance and how it ’s doing? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, we ’ve long been aware, a nd I’ve spoken about 
previously disturbing trends in the economy, particularly rising wage inequality, income inequality, and the fact that a significant share of our population hasn’ t been enjoying significant 
real wage gains , if any.  And so these are long -standi ng concerns.  These are not new 
phenomenon, but the recession was very severe and probably exacerbated developments that had 
 December 14, 2016  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 20  
 long been affecting many American workers and households.  And I think they are quite 
disturbing. 
Now, the y’re ones that the Fed is  not well  positioned— I think our policies can affect the 
general level of economic activity and slack in the labor market, the level —the rate of inflation , 
which we focus on.  But I think it ’s important for policymakers more broadly to be attentive to 
these trends and to think about policies that could address them.  We ’ve been quite attentive with 
respect to particular demographic groups in the labor market .  Particularly , minorities tend to be 
very badly affected by downturns.  We ’ve discussed that .  We’ve been focused on it —it’s not 
just since the election —and are pleased to see that they are enjoying gains.  For example, the 
African  American unemployment rate at this point is no w rough— about back to 2007 levels as 
well.  But these are important trends, and I think it ’s important for policy to address them.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
March  15, 2017  
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided 
to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to ¾ to 
1 percent.  Our decision to make another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodatio n reflects the economy ’s continued progress toward the employment and price 
stability objectives assigned to us by law.  For some time the Committee has judged that, if economic conditions evolved as anticipated, gradual increases in the federal funds rate  would 
likely be appropriate to achieve and maintain our objectives.  Today ’s decision is in line with 
that view and does not represent a reassessment of the economic outlook or of the appropriate course for monetary policy.  I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy shortly, but first I ’ll 
review recent economic developments and the outlook. 
The economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Solid income gains and relatively 
high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth have supported household spending  growth.  
Business investment, which was soft for much of last year, has firmed somewhat, and business sentiment is at favorable levels.  Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.  
Job gains aver aged about 200,000 per month over the past three months, maintaining the 
solid pace we have seen over the past year.  The unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in February, near its recent low.  Broader measures of labor market underutilization also remain low .  
Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further si gn of improving conditions in the 
labor market.  Looking ahead, w e expect that job conditions will strengthen somewhat further.

 Turning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures rose to nearly 2 percent in J anuary, up from less than 1 percent last summer.  That 
rise was largely driven by energy prices, which have been increasing recently after earlier 
declines.  Core inflation —which excludes volatile energy and food prices and tends to be a better 
indicator of future inflation —has been little changed in recent months at about 1¾ percent.  We 
expect core inflation to move up and overall inflation to stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective. 
Let me now turn  to the economic projections that were submitted for this meeting by 
Committee participants.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s 
assessment of the many factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for growth of 
inflation -adjusted gross domestic product is 2.1 percent this year and next , and edges down to 
1.9 percent in 2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate.  Th e median projection for the 
unemployment rate stands at 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and remains at that level over the next two years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.  
Finally, the median inflation proje ction is 1.9 percent this year and rises to 2 percent in 2018 and 
2019.  These economic projections are very little changed from those made in December.  
Returning to monetary policy, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal 
funds rate is appropriate in light of the economy ’s solid progress toward our goals of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Even after this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative, thus supporting some further strengthening in the job market and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.  Today ’s decision also reflects our view that waiting too long to 
scale back some accommodation could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 21  
 down the road, which, in turn, could risk disrupting financial marke ts and pushing the economy 
into recession. 
  We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual 
increases in the federal funds rate to achieve and maintain our objectives.  That ’s based on our 
view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither 
expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel —is currently 
quite low by historical standards.  That means that the federal funds rate does not have to rise by all that much to get to a neutral policy stance.  We also expect the neutral level of the federal 
funds rate to rise somewhat over time, meaning that additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of the federal funds rate is still likely to 
remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.  
This view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appr opriate monetary policy.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 3 percent at the end of 2019, in line with its estimated longer -run 
value.  Compared with the projec tions made in December, the median path for the federal funds 
rate is essentially unchanged.  
As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their 
assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.  Changes in economic policies, including fiscal and other policies, could potentially affect the economic outlook.  Of course, it is still too early to know how these policies will unfold.  Moreover, fiscal policy is only one of many factors that can influence the outlook.  In making our decisions, we will continue —as 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 21  
 always —to assess economic conditions relative to our dual mandate.  As I ’ve noted previously, 
policy is not on a  preset course.  
Finally, we will continue to reinvest proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and 
principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.   This policy, by keeping 
the Committee ’s holdings of longer -term securities at sizable levels, has helped maintain 
accommodative financial conditions.  As a matter of prudent planning, we discussed at this 
meeting a number of issues related to an eventual change to our reinvestment policy.  We made 
no decisions, and we will continue our disc ussion at subsequent meetings.  In keeping with the 
principle that the process of normalizing our balance sheet will be gradual and predictable, we 
will provide more information about our plans as it becomes available.  
Thank you.  I ’d be happy to take your  questions. 
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  Could I 
take you up on the last topic, which is the balance sheet normalization ?  Clearly you said you 
don’t want to start pulling in the size of the balance sheet until no rmalization “ is well under 
way. ”  Could you give us some sort of sense about what “ well under way ” means, at least in your 
mind?  What kind of hurdles are you setting?  What kind of economic conditions would you like 
to see?  Is it just a matter of the lev el of the short -term federal funds rate as being the main issue?  
And what kind of role do you see the role of the balance sheet playing in the normalization 
process over the longer term?  Is it an active tool, or is it a passive tool?  Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLE N.  So let me start with the second question first.  We ’ve emphasized for 
quite some time that the Committee wishes to use variations in the f ed funds r ate target —our 
short -term interest rate target—as our key active tool of policy.  We think it ’s much easier in 
using that tool to communicate the stance of policy.  We have much more experience with it and 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 21  
 have a better idea of its impact on the economy.  So while the balance sheet , asset purchases are 
a tool that we could conceivably resort to if we found ourselves in a serious downturn where we 
were, again, up against the zero bound and faced with substantial weakness in the economy , it’s 
not a tool that we would want to use as a routine tool of policy.  
You asked what “ well under way ” means.  I can’t give you a specific answer to that.  And 
I think the right —the right way to look at it is in qualitative and not quantitative terms.  It doesn’ t 
mean some particular cutoff level for the federal funds rate that, when we’ ve reached that level, 
we would consider ourselves well under way.  I think what we want to have is confidence in the 
economy ’s trajectory , a sense that the economy will make progress, that we ’re not overly 
worried about downside risks and adverse shocks that could hit the economy that c ould 
quickly —after setting it off on the path to shrinking the balance sheet gradually over time —
cause us to want to begin to add monetary policy accommodation.  So I think it has to do with 
the balance of risks and confidence in the economic outlook and not simply the level of the federal funds rate.  
JASON LANGE.  Hi, thank you.  Jason Lange with Reuters.   You mentioned that you 
don’t—that you don’ t—you want to not have to raise rates rapidly if you were to fall behind the 
curve.  In the current context, “ gradual ” has been very, very gradual.  Could you describe what a 
rapid rate of increases should be—how that should be understood?  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I ’m not sure that I can tell you what “ a rapid rate of increases ” is.  
I think the trajectory that you see is the median in our projections , which, this year, looks to a 
total of three increases.   That certainly qualifies as gradual.  My comfort in using the term 
“gradual ” comes back, in part, to my judgment that the neutral  level of the federal funds rate—
namely , the level of the federal funds rate that would  keep the economy operating on an even 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 21  
 keel, that it’ s a rate where we neither are pressing on the brake nor pushing down on the 
accelerator —that level of interest rates  is quite low.   So, at present, I see monetary policy as 
accommodative—namely, the current level of the federal funds rate is below that neutral rate, but 
not very far below the neutral rate.  
We’re closing in, I think, on our employment objective.  We ’re coming closer on our 
inflation objective.  As we reach those objectives, and particularly in light of the fact that we see the risks to  the outlook as roughly balanced at this point —and that ’s been our assessment for the 
last several meetings —it looks t o us to be appropriate to gradually raise the federal funds rate 
back in the direction of neutral.  And exactly how many increases is that?  You know, the SEP 
gives you a sense of what Committee participants envision in a concrete sense .  But, you know, 
if it’s one more or one less, I think that  still—that  still qualifies to my mind as gradual, I think , if 
you compare it with any previous tightening cycle .  I remember when rates were raised at every 
meeting starting in mid -2004.  And I think people thought that was a gradual pace, a measured 
pace.  And we ’re certainly not envisioning something like that.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Both the OECD and the IMF have raised 
their forecast s, in part because of —for the U.S. growth—in part because of the p olicies expected 
from the new A dministration , yet the Fed has not .  And I take it from your comment at the very 
beginning that this —these forecasts today represent no reassessment.  Has the Committee 
discussed what policy might look like in the event that there are large tax cuts passed or infrastructure spending passed?   And what might policy look like if those policies become law?   
Finally, why did you remove the word “only” before the word “gradual ” when you talked about 
future rate increases?  
            CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have not discussed in detail potential policy changes that could 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 21  
 be put into place, and we have not tried to map out what our response would be to particular 
policy measures.  We recognize that there is great uncertainty about the ti ming, the size, the 
character of policy changes that may be put in place a nd don’ t think that that’ s a decision, or a 
set of decisions, that we need to make until we know more about what policy changes will go into effect.   So I do want to emphasize that, while some participants have penciled in some fiscal 
policy changes into their projections, that the basis for today ’s decision is simply our assessment 
of the progress of the economy against our long -established goals of maximum employment and 
price stabi lity.  There ’s nothing that we  have done or anticipate that is a speculation.  I think it ’s 
fair to say , there’ s nothing that ’s a speculation about preemptive responses to future policy 
moves.  We have plenty of time to see what happens.  
We did remove the word “only” in the statement today from “ gradual. ”  I think this is 
something that shouldn’ t be overinterpreted.  I regard it as a relatively small change and think 
it’s appropriate for you to consider it in the context, for example, of t he fact that our economic 
projections are virtually identical to those that we issued in December.  They ’re essentially 
unchanged both in terms of the path of the economy and the path of the federal funds rate.  So we have carried out a modest adjustment o f the federal funds rate because we’ ve seen the 
economy progressing over the last several months in exactly the way that we anticipated.  We haven ’t in any way changed our view about where the economy is heading or the risks.  We had 
long said that if the economy progressed, and—it’ s, you know, it ’s been doing nicely, I think, in 
making progress, in showing resilience , and we have, you know, have some confidence in the 
path the economy  is on.  And if we continue to feel that, we will likely regard it a s app ropriate to 
make some further moves to scale back accommodation to move toward neutral , along the lines 
in the SEP. 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 21  
 Now, obviously, there are surprises.  Our economic forecast s can change.  But the word 
“gradual, ” I think, emphasizes that if things continue in the manner that we’ ve been going, as we 
have said now for quite some time, we think that  gradual —some gradual increases in the federal 
funds rate —will be appropriate.  And this is not a, you know, this is not a significant —this is not 
a significant ch ange.  
PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business, ma’ am.  Speaking of fiscal policy, have 
you had a chance to meet with the new Treasury Secretary yet, Mr. Mnuchin?  If not, when will 
you meet with him?  What do you want to talk to him about?  And, separately, have you had a 
chance to talk to President Trump yet or meet with him?  And, if not, would you like to, and would you, and what would you talk about?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I ’m 
getting to know him.  And I think, you know, it ’s traditional for F ed Chairs and Treasury 
Secretaries to meet on a regular basis , and I fully expect to have a strong relationship with 
Secretary Mnuchin.  We  have had very good discussions about the econom y, about regulatory 
objectives, the work of the FSOC, global economic developments , and I look forward to 
continuing to work with him.  I was introduced to the President.  I had a very brief meeting and 
appreciated that as well.  
ANA SWANSON.  Ana Swanson, the Washington Post.  You said that the neutral level 
of the federal funds rate is quite low.  How close do you judge it to be to the inflation rate?  And what do you anticipate will be the force pushing up the neutral interest rate over the next few years ?  Could fiscal policy be among those?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So I ’ve given a number of recent speeches on this topic where I ’ve 
developed my views more fully.  I would say, over the longer run—that means going several 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 21  
 years out —I think the evidence suggests that the neutral rate may be something , in real terms , 
that might be close to 1 percent or a little bit under that.  That would be consistent with the 
median longer -run value of the federal funds rate in our economic projections for the last several 
meetings.  Three percent is the longer -run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate .  In 
real terms , with a 2 percent inflation objective —that ’s 1 percent in real terms.  And I ’ve 
indicate d—why is it so low?  Well, I think there ’s very strong evidence tha t’s accumulated that 
this rate has been falling not just in the United States, but in many advanced nations , and the 
decline probably predates the financial crisis.  I think in part it reflects slowing population 
growth and also slow productivity growth he re and in many other advanced nations.  But some 
recent work suggests that, at the present time, the neutral real rate is yet lower than that , and 
some estimates place it around zero in real terms.  So I think the lower current rate arguably reflects headw inds that are left over from the financial crisis.   One form of headwind, I think, has 
been caution and restraint and risk aversion on the part of households and businesses that ’s held 
back spending decisions.  And, I suppose, my judgment that it ’ll move u p over time reflects a 
notion that part of that will gradually dissipate over the years.  
So that ’s a sense of where I think —now , there is uncertainty about the neutral rate.  And, 
as you mentioned, it is —it can be affected by shifts in fiscal policy.  How the neutral rate i s 
affected by fiscal policy —that really depends importantly on the nature, the size of the fiscal 
shift and the effect it has both on demand and supply in the economy.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, 
between the release of the minutes of the previous meeting late last month and your speech in Chicago earlier this month, market expectations about an increase in rates today changed quite dramatically.  What happened over the course of thos e two weeks to make officials far more 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 21  
 interested in signaling the idea of raising rates at today ’s meeting?  And why do you think the 
market was so out of sync with where the central bank was?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So, when I look at our sequence of communications, they seem to me 
to have been reasonably consistent over this entire period.  We had indicated in December that 
we expect —we saw the risks as balanced , and if the economy continued to progress along the 
lines we expected, that several rate increases wou ld likely be appropriate.  The minutes of our 
January meeting indicated that many participants thought that an increase in the f unds r ate would 
be appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those line s.  I indicated in my c ongressional 
testimony tha t I thought that, indeed, the economy was progressing in line with our expectations.  
And, as I think all of us —having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress 
along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced —do regard it as 
appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that ’s in place by  having several interest rate 
increases this year .  As we saw the data continue to come in in line with our expectations , my 
colleagues and I spoke out and indicated that, indeed, that had been and continued to be our expectations.  
Now, you know, when you ask me, how did we get out of sync with the market, this is 
something I tried to reflect on a bit in the remarks I made in Chicago.  And, of course, it is true that in 2015 and in 2016 each, we raised the federal funds rate only once , and perhaps market 
participants have been influenced by that pattern.   I did try to explain the reasons why we had 
moved so slowly during those two years.  And it reflects, I think, a set of s hocks partly 
emanating from the global economy and risks that we saw to the outlook as well as more fundamental assessments —reassessments pertaining to the neutral level of the federal funds rate 
and the longer -run normal level of the unemployment rate.  S o I think there are reasons, but it is 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 21  
 important for the public to understand that we ’re getting closer to reaching our objectives ; that 
policy is accommodative ; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probably 
quite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy ; and it will be appropriate to 
gradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we ’re on.  
 BINYAMIN AP PELBAUM.   Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.   The Bank for 
International Settlements  has raised concerns that central banks are being insufficiently attentive 
to asset price—excuse me, asset price inflation.  And stock market investors in the United Stat es 
certainly don ’t seem to be waiting for the Trump A dministration to actually implement its fiscal 
policies.  And I guess I ’m just curious to know how much of a concern that is for you.  And, if 
not, why not, given the remarkably elevated level of stock price evaluation s? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we do look at financial conditions in formulating our view of 
the outlook, a nd stock prices do figure into financial conditions.  So I think the higher level of 
stock prices is one factor that looks like it ’s likely to somewhat boost consumption spending.  
We also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads , particularly for lower -grade 
corporate issuers , have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have become 
somewhat easier.  Now,  on the other side, longer -term interest rates are up some in recent 
months, and the dollar is a little stronger.   How does that net out?   There are private- sector 
analysts that produce financial conditions  indices that attempt to aggregate all these diffe rent 
factors affecting financial conditions.  And for some of the more prominent analysts and indices, 
I think the conclusion they  have reached is that financial conditions , on balance , have eased , and 
that’s partly driven by the stock market.  So that is a factor that affects the outlook.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.   Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.  You and Secretary 
Mnuchin will be meeting with your G -20 colleagues in Germany this weekend.  What do you 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 21  
 expect to find there?  Do you think the group assessment i s going to be that the world economy 
is finally out of the woods, doing better?  Or do you think that there ’s still going to be worries 
about risk?   And would one of those risk worries be that the Fed might raise rates too quickly?  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we  always exchange views on the economic outlook and 
developments in our country , and it will be my objective to explain —explain U.S. monetary 
policy and to try to make the same points to them that I ’ve made here already today about what 
the outlook is for m onetary policy in the United States.  I think it ’s fair to say that the global 
economy is doing better.  It’s growing a bit more strongly than it was, perhaps, the last time I got 
together that the —with my counterparts in the G -20—that the risks do look somewhat more 
balanced .  But there remain a set of very significant risks , medium term, facing the global 
economy , and I’m sure that those will be discussed as well.  
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times .  You said you 
and your col leagues aren ’t making assumptions about stimulative fiscal policies, but many other 
people are.  Business and consumer confidence has jumped since the election.  Homebuilder 
sentiment today was at its highest level since 2005.  Are you concerned about the effects on the economy if some of these policies, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending , don’ t get enacted 
or are delayed?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we recognize—our statement actually last time noted that there 
had been an improvement , a marked improvement  in business and household sentiment.  It’s 
uncertain just how much sentiment actually impacts spending decisions.  And I wouldn’ t say at 
this point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based on expectations about the future.  We exchange around the table what we learn from our many business contacts, and I think it ’s fair to say that many of my colleagues and I note a much more 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 21  
 optimistic frame of mind among many —many businesses in recent months.  But , I’d say , most of 
the bus iness people that we ’ve talked to also have a wait -and-see attitude and are very hopeful 
that they will be able to expand investment and are looking forward to doing that but are waiting 
to see what will happen.  So we will watch that.   And, of course, if we were to see a major shift 
in spending reflecting those expectations, that could very well affect the outlook.  I’m not seeing 
it—I’m not seeing that at this point, but the shift in sentiment is obvious and notable. 
KATE DAVIDSON.  Thank you, Madam Chair .  Kate Davidson from Dow Jones.  
There’ s a perception out there that the Fed could somehow stand in the way of some of the 
economic growth policies that the new Administration is pursuing.  Given that the Fed is projecting 1.8 percent growth in the long r un, is this a potential point of conflict for the Fed and 
the new Administration?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I don’ t believe it is a point of conflict.   We would certainly 
welcome stronger economic growth in a context of price stability.  And if policies were put i n 
place to speed growth that I ’ve certainly urged Congress and the Administration to consider —
policies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy ’s so-called speed limit or 
potential to grow —I think that those would be —those would be very welcome changes that we 
would like to see. 
KATHLEEN HAYS.  Chair Yellen, Kathleen Hays.   Oh, excuse me, Kathleen Hays from 
Bloomberg.  I’m going to try to take the opposite side of this because —on this question about 
market expectations and how the markets  got things wrong, and then how you say the Fed 
suddenly clarified what it already said.  But, for example, if the —if you look at the Atlanta Fed ’s 
latest GDP tracker for the first quarter, it’ s down to 0.9 percent.  We had a retail sales report that 
was m ixed.  Granted the, you know, upward revisions  of previous months make it look better, 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 21  
 but the consumer does not appear to be roaring in the first quarter, kind of underscoring the wait -
and-see attitude you just mentioned. 
If you look at measures of labor compensation, you note in the  statement that they ’re not 
moving up, a nd, in fact, they are .  And if you look at average —there are so many things you can 
look at.  And you yourself have said in the past that the fact that that is happening is perhaps an 
indication there ’s still slack in the labor market.  
I guess my question is this :  In another sense, what happened between December and 
March?  GDP is tracking very low.  Measures of labor compensation are not threatening to boost inflation any time fast.  The  consumer is not picking up very much.  Fiscal policy —we don’ t 
know what ’s going to happen with Donald Trump.  And yet you have to raise rates now.  So 
what is the —what is the motivation here?   The economy is so far from your forecast in terms of 
GDP, why does the Fed have to move now?  What does  this signal, then, about the rest of the 
year?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So GDP is a pretty noisy indicator.  If one averages through several 
quarters, I would describe our economy as one that has been growing around 2 percent per year.  And as you can see from our projections, we —that ’s something we expect to continue over the 
next couple of years.  Now, that pa ce of growth has been consistent with a pace of job creation 
that is more rapid than what is sustainable if labor force participation begins to move down in line with what we see as its longer -run trend with an aging population. 
Now, unemployment hasn’ t moved that much, in part because people have been drawn 
into the labor force.  Labor force participation, as I mentioned in my remarks, has been about flat 
over the last three  years.   So, in that sense, the economy has shown over the last several years 
that it may have had more room to run than some people might have estimated, and that ’s been 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 21  
 good.  It’s meant we ’ve had a great deal of job creation over these years.   And there could be —
there could be room left for that to play out further.  In fact, look, policy remains 
accommodative.  We expect further improvement in the labor market.  We expect the 
unemployment rate to move down further and to stay down for the next several years.  So we do expect that the path of policy we think is appropriate is one that is going to lead to some further strengthening in the labor market.  
KATHLEEN HAYS.  [Inaudible]  Just quickly , then, I just want to underscore —I want to 
ask you, so following on that, you expect it to move.  But w hat if it doesn ’t?  What if GDP 
doesn’ t pick up?  What if you don’ t see wage measures rising?  What if you don’ t—what if the 
core PCE gets stuck at 1.7  percent ?  W ould you— is it your view, perhaps, that if there ’s a risk 
right now in the median forecast for dots, that it ’s fewer hikes this year , rather than the 
consensus , or more?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, look, our policy is not set in stone.  It is data dependent , and 
we’re—we ’re not locked into any particular policy path.  Our —you know, as you said, the data 
have not notably strengthened.  I—there  is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter , but 
we haven ’t changed our view of the outlook.  We think we ’re on the same path , not—we haven ’t 
boosted the outlook, projected faster growth.   We think we ’re moving along the same course 
we’ve been on, but it is one that involves gradual tightening in the labor market.  I would 
describe some measures of wage growth as having moved up some.  Some measures haven ’t 
moved up, but there ’s some evidence that wage growth is gradually moving up, which is also 
suggestive of a strengthening labor market.  
And we expect policy to remain accommodative now for some time.  So we ’re—we’re 
talking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progress 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 21  
 moving toward neutral.  But we ’re continui ng to provide accommodation to the economy that ’s 
allowing it to grow at an above -trend pace that ’s consistent with further improvement in the 
labor market.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with  the American Banker.  A  regulatory 
question, if I may.  The Administration  has recently reiterated its support for a reinstatement of 
Glass -Steagall.  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has called for a “21st century Glass -Steagall. ”  
Keeping in mind that there  are no specifics on this proposal, is the fundamental idea of 
separating commercial banking from investment banking a fruitful line of inquiry?  Is this the 
right path to be pursuing?  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I ’ve not seen any concrete proposals along this line.  I don ’t 
really know what a “ 21st century Glass -Steagall”  would look like.  I think my reading on the 
financial crisis is that that wasn ’t the major source of the financial crisis.  In fact, many of the 
problems emanated from firms that were investment banking units.  To me, an important reform 
in the aftermath of the crisis was to make sure that investment banking activities where —that 
were a core part of the shadow banking system where leverage had built —that those were 
appropriately capitalized, had appropriate liquidity , and their management was strengthened, and  
that’s what we have tried to do.  But, obviously, we would look at any proposals that are put 
forward.  I’m not aware of anything concrete to react to.  
 JOHN HELTMAN.   So—so  you don’ t think it’ s necessar ily [inaudible] a really good 
idea?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  W ell, I don ’t think it was the cause of the financial crisis, and I do 
feel that we have significantly strengthened supervision of bank holding companies that incorporate investment banking activities.

 JO LING KENT.  Hi, Chair Yellen.   I’m Jo Ling Kent with NBC News.  I just want to 
know, what message are you trying to send consumers with this particular rate hike?  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  I think that ’s a great question .  I appreciate your asking it.  And the 
simple message is , the economy  is doing well.  We have confidence in the robustness of the 
economy and its resilience to shocks.  It’s performed well over the last several years.   We  have 
created, since the trough in employment after the financial crisis, around 16 million jobs.  The 
unemploym ent rate has moved way down, a nd many more people feel optimistic about their 
prospects in the labor market.  There i s job security.  We ’re seeing more people who are feeling 
free to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities.  So I think the job market, which is an important focus for us, is certainly improving.  
That’s not to say that it’ s a—good labor market conditions for every individual in the 
United States.  We know there are problems that face, particularly , people with less skill and 
education and in certain sectors of the economy, but many Americans are enjoying a stronger labor market and feel better —feel very much better about that.   And inflation is moving —
moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective.  And we ’re operating in an environment 
where the U.S. economy is performing well and risks seem  pretty balanced.  So I think people 
can feel good about the economic outlook. 
 JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.  You emphasized in the 
statement that the Fed ’s inflation target is “ symmetric. ”  Would you be able to expand a little bit 
on why you did that, why it was included, how much of an overshoot would the Fed be willing to tolerate, and for how long?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, a couple of years ago, we included the word “symmetric ” in 
our statement of longer -run goals , and this seemed like an appropriate time to introduce that 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 21  
 word into the statement because we had previously indicated that there was a shortfall of 
inflation from our 2 percent objective.  Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to 2 percent.  As I indicated, a better forward -looking measure of inflation, core inflation—t hat’s 
not our target, but I think it ’s worth looking at because it ’s a better f orward -looking predictor of 
headline inflation —I think that ’s still running a little bit under 2 percent, but we expect it’ s going 
to move up to 2.  And this seemed like a good time to remind Americans that what our objective is is 2 percent inflation.  Inflation is not always going to be at 2 percent.  It’s—like all economic 
variables, it fluctuates.  Sometimes it’ s going to be below 2 percent , sometimes it’ s going to be 
above 2 percent.  We ’ve had a long period in which inflation has run under 2 percent.  As we 
move back to 2 percent, which is where we ’re heading, there will be some times when it ’s above 
2 percent as well.   And it ’s a reminder —2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation, i t’s a target.   It’s 
where we always want inflation to be heading.  And t here will be some times when inflation is 
above 2 percent, just like it ’s been below 2 percent.  We ’re not shooting for inflation above 
2 percent , but it’ s a reminder that there will be deviations above and below when we ’re 
achieving our objective. 
 JEANNA SMIALEK.  How well can you tolerate an overshoot?  
CHAIR YELLEN.   Well, we would—if there were an overshoot and it appeared to be 
persistent, we would put in place policies to try to bring inflation back to 2 percent.  That ’s the 
core set of princip les that we have adopted in our statement on longer -run goals and strategy.  
And exactly how long it would take to get back to 2 percent would depend, in part, on what was happening with respect to employment and our other objectives.  So there ’s no hard a nd fast 
answer to that.  
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL

  PATRICK GILLESPIE.  Chair Yellen, Patrick Gillespie with CNN.   Some fiscal policy 
proposals, such as the border adjustment tax, would cause the dollar to strengthen significantly 
over a short period of time.  I realize you can ’t comment on the specific policy proposal, but if 
the dollar were to strengthen quickly over a short period of time, perhaps some 20 percent for whatever reason, what would—what do you think the impact would be on the U.S. economy, particularly in exports and manufacturing?   And what do you think would be any implications 
for U.S. monetary policy ? 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So that ’s a—that ’s a difficult question to answer.  You asked that 
question not in an isolated way :  What would the impact of a large appreciation of the dollar be? 
But, as I understand it, you asked about it in the context of a border tax adjustment.  Is that right? 
Because the argument that is made is that what a border tax would do without an exchange rate adjustment is to raise the price of imported  goods into the United States.  And that large 
movement in the dollar that analysts claim would occur would essentially —if it were complete, 
would fully offset the impact of the border tax on U.S. import goods.  So, it wouldn’ t end up 
having an impact on U .S. inflation or GDP growth. 
But a question that ’s a very different —that ’s a very different matter than if, suddenly , for 
some reason, the dollar were simply to begin appreciating by a large amount, say, because there were flight -to-safety flows into the dollar.   I mean, if —if the latter were to occur, there were just 
a big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downw ard pressure on inflation and would have a 
negative effect on U.S. export growth and tend to boost imports.  But that ’s a, that’s a  different —
that’s a different exercise.  I would just say , it’s very uncertain exactly what would happen to the 
dollar.  Ther e has been a lot of discussion of that, and I think it ’s complicated and uncertain.

  VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Chair Yellen.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  My question is 
about Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee wrote to you asking that the Fed 
not put forward any regulations until a Vice Chair of Supervision is in place.  So I have a couple 
of questions about that.  One is, are you all pulling back at all on any regulations —maybe not all 
regulations, but, you know, maybe only going forward w ith ones that you see as more time  
sensitive?  And during the hearing before that committee, you mentioned specifically the CCAR stress- test rule would have to come out sometime before that next cycle.  Are there any other 
time-sensitive regulations?  
 CHAI R YELLEN.   So at this point we don’ t have a lot of time -sensitive regulations.  
There is nothing right now that we need to get out that ’s a significant rule.  So we have a 
relatively light regulatory agenda at this point.  We recognize, of course, that we do have an obligation to write the rules that Congress, you know, dictates in laws that they pass , and so that 
is an ongoing obligation—obligation that we have.  But our calendar is relatively light at this point. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  I’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Back 
here.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER .  Some Fed critics have said it ’s too soon to raise 
interest rates because wages haven ’t risen enough to justify a rate increase.  What would you say 
to that?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I don ’t—I would like to see wages increase and think there ’s 
some scope for them to increase somewhat further.  But our objectives are maximum employment and inflation , and we need to consider what path of rates is appropriate to foster 
March 15, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 21  
 those objecti ves.  Unfortunately, one of the things that ’s been holding down wage increases is 
very slow productivity growth.  And I think we are seeing some upward pressure as the labor 
market tightens.  I take that as a signal that we ’re coming closer to our maximum employment 
objectives.  But productivity is —for those focusing on wage growth, productivity is an additional 
important factor.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen ’s Press Conference  
June  14, 2017 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Before I get started, I just want to say that our 
thoughts are with those who were injured this morning.  
Today the Federal Open Market Committee decided to raise the target range for the 
federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1 to 1¼ percent.  Our decision to make 
another gradual reduction in the amount of policy accommodation reflects the progress the economy has made, and is expected to make, toward maximum employment and price stability objectives assigned to us by law.  
We also released today, as an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and 
Plans, additional information on the pr ocess that we will follow in normalizing the size of our 
balance sheet once we determine that it is appropriate to begin doing so.  I ’ll have more to say 
about our interest rate decision and our balance sheet policy, but first I ’ll review recent economic 
developments and the outlook. 
Following a slowdown in the first quarter, economic growth appears to have rebounded, 
resulting in a moderate pace of growth so far this year.  Household spending, which was particularly soft earlier this year, has been support ed by solid fundamentals, including ongoing 
improvement in the job market and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth.  Business investment, which was weak for much of last year, has continued to expand.  And exports have shown greater stre ngth this year, in part reflecting a pickup in global growth.  
Overall, we continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the next few years.  
In the labor market, job gains have averaged about 160,000 per month since the start of 
the year —a solid rate of growth that, although a little slower than last year, remains well above 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 23  
 estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  The unemployment 
rate has fallen about ½ percentage point since the beginning of the year and was 4.3 percent in May, a low level by historical standards and modestly below the median of FOMC participants ’ 
estimates of its longer -run normal level.  Broader measures of labor  market utilization have also 
improved this year.  Participation in the labor force has been little changed, on net, for about three years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relatively steady participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.  Looking ahead, w e expect that the job market will strengthen 
somewhat further. 
Turning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures was 1.7 percent in April, up from less than 1 percent last summer but down somewhat over the past few months.  Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and 
energy categories and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation—has also edged lower.  The recent lower readings on inflation have  been driven significantly by what appear to be one -
off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs.  These price declines will, as a matter of arithmetic, restrain the 12 -month inflation figures 
until the extraordinarily low March reading drops out of the calculation.  However, with employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 per cent over the next 
couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective.  Nonetheless, in light of the softer recent 
inflation readings, the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.  
Let me now turn to the economic projections that Committe e participants submitted for 
this meeting.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 23  
 of appropriate monetary policy , which, in turn, depend on each participant ’s assessment of the 
many factors that shape the outlo ok.  The median projection for growth of inflation- adjusted 
gross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.2 percent this year and edges down to 1.9 percent by 
2019, slightly above its estimated longer -run rate.  The median projection for the unemployment 
rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and ticks down to 4.2 percent in 2018 
and 2019, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.  Finally, the median 
inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year and rises to 2 per cent in 2018 and 2019.  Compared 
with the projections made in March, real GDP growth is little changed, the unemployment rate follows a moder ately lower path, and inflation—alt hough marked down this year for reasons I 
mentioned earlier —is unchanged over the following two years.  In addition, the median estimate 
of the longer -run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent.  
Returning to monetary policy, for the past year and a half the FOMC has been gradually 
increasing its target range for th e federal funds rate as the economy has continued to make 
progress toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Our decision today continues this process. 
We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual 
increases in the federal funds rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around 
our 2 percent longer -run objective.  That ’s based on our view that the federal funds rate remains 
somewhat below its neutral level —that is, the level of the  federal funds rate that is neither 
expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.  Because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much furth er to get to a neutral policy stance.  But because we also expect the neutral 
level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 23  
 to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Even so, the 
Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of the federal funds rate is 
likely to remain below levels that prevailed in previous decades.  
This view is consistent with participants ’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of next year, and 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, about in line with its estimated longer -
run value.  Compared with the projections made in March, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged.  
As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their 
assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes t o their 
economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.  As I ’ve noted previously, policy is 
not on a preset course. 
Let me now turn to our balance sheet.  As I noted in our policy statement, we are 
continuing to maintain the size of our balanc e sheet by reinvesting proceeds from maturing 
Treasury securities and principal payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities.   
Provided that the economy evolves broadly as the Committee anticipates, we currently expect to 
begin implementing a b alance sheet normalization program this year.  Consistent with the 
principles and plans we released in 2014, this program would gradually decrease our 
reinvestments and initiate a gradual and largely predictable decline in our securities holdings.  
The adde ndum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that we released today 
provides further information.  For both Treasury and agency securities, we will reinvest proceeds 
from our holdings only to the extent that they exc eed gradually rising caps on  the reductions in 
our securities holdings.  Initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels —$6 billion per 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 23  
 month for Treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies.  So, any proceeds exceeding those 
amounts would be reinvested.  These caps will gradually rise over the course of a year to 
maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency 
securities and will remain in place through the normalization process.  By limiting the volume of 
securities that private inve stors will have to absorb as we reduce our holdings, the caps should 
guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other potential market strains. 
As I previously noted, when our securities holdings begin to gradually decline, so too will 
the supply of reserve balances in the banking system.  At some point, probably a few years down 
the road, the Committee will bring the decline in our balance sheet to an end as the quantity of 
reserves is normalized.  I can ’t tell you what the longer -run normal level of reserve balances will 
be because that will depend on the Committee ’s eventual decisions about how to implement 
monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as -yet 
unknown elements, including the banking syst em’s future demand for reserves and various 
factors that may affect the daily supply of reserves.  What I can tell you is that we anticipate 
reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in 
recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.  
As readers of our minutes know, the Committee has on previous occasions discussed 
potential long -run frameworks for implementing monetary policy.  Decisions about the 
appropriate long -run framework do not need to be  made for quite some time, and our future 
deliberations will benefit from the experience we will gain during the normalization process.  At 
this point, I ’ll just point out that our current system is working well and has some important 
advantages.  In parti cular, it is simple and efficient to operate, does not require active 
management of the supply of reserves, and, most importantly, provides good control over the 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 23  
 federal funds rate and effective transmission of changes in the federal funds rate to broader 
money market rates.  And because our current system is likely compatible with a much smaller 
quantity of reserves, our plan for gradually reducing our balance sheet does not constrain the 
Committee ’s future options for how to implement monetary policy.  
Finally, as noted in today ’s addendum, the Committee affirmed that changing the target 
range for the federal funds rate is our  primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  
In other words, the balance sheet is not intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in 
normal times.  However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material 
deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds 
rate.  More generally, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including 
altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to 
warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the 
federal funds rate.  
Thank you.  I ’ll now be  happy to take your questions. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.   Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Yellen, the 
principles you released today say the balance sheet wind -down should commence once interest 
rate normalization is “ well under  way.”  With this latest rate increase, do you believe 
normalization is now well under  way?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So that is something that we ’ve said for some time , and I ’ve 
previously —when I ’ve been asked what “ well under  way ” means —said that I don ’t want to 
define that in purely quantitative terms but rather in qualitative terms.  So there ’s no specific 
level of the federal funds rate that means we’ re well under  way.  But it’ s also a question of not 
only the current level , but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 23  
 the federal funds rate.  So we have increased our federal funds rate target now several times.  Our 
outlook is that we anticipate further increases this year and next year for the federal funds rate , 
and our statement indicates that if the economy continues to evolve in the manner  that we expect , 
that we would feel the conditions are in —will be in place to begin this process this year.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Madam Chair, I ’m wondering if you’ ve 
talked to the P resident or members of his  staff about th e possibility of staying on as C hair for a 
second term.  I’m also wondering if you would consider doing that —that ’s something you 
thought about doing.  And , finally, the re are three vacancies on the F ed.  Have you —do you have 
any comment at all for the P resident about his failure to nominate anybody for those three 
positions?  Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So what I ’ve said about my own situation is that I fully intend to serve 
out my term as C hair, which ends in early February.  I have not had conversations with the 
President about future plans.  And I do very much hope —I know that they have been working 
hard to identify appropriate nominees for the open slots , and I do very much hope that there will 
be nominations in the not -too-distant future , and that the Senate will take those up expeditiously.  
I look forward to having a full B oard.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  And , I’m sorry, just to follow up:  Do you desire to stay on?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  I really don ’t have anything for you at this point. 
SAM FLEMING.   Thank s very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  We ’ve 
now had a very long streak of —or fairly long streak of wea k inflation numbers , at least measured 
by the CPI th is morning as well.  Marketplace -based inflation expectations are declining.   What 
kind of vigilance are you now saying is needed in terms of wea k inflation?  How does that 
interact with your policy outlook?  And would further disappointments argue for pressing 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 23  
 “pause ” on rate hikes or delay ing balance sheet runoff?  How do you think about thos e two 
potential responses to wea k inflation?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me just say , as I emphasized in my statement and always say , 
mone tory policy is not on a preset course.  We indicated in our statement  today that we ’re 
closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there 
have been several weak readings , particular ly on core inflation.  Our statement indicates that we 
expect inflation to remain low in the near te rm.  But , on the other hand, we continue to feel that 
with a strong labor market  and a labor market that ’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are 
in place for inflation to move up.  Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully  and 
ensure , especially with roughly five years o f inflation running under our 2 percent  objective —
that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed.  And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent  inflation , and I pledge that we  
will do that.  
But let me say , with respect to recent readings, i t’s important not to overreact to a few 
readings , and data on inflation can be noisy.  As I pointed out, there have been some 
idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a  huge 
decline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs.  We had an 
exceptionally low reading on core PC E in March, and that will continue to hold down 12- month 
changes until that reading drops out.  But we are —this morning ’s reading on the CPI showed 
weakness in a number of categories , and it ’s certainly something that we will be closely 
monitoring in the months ahead.  We will—we ’re focused on making our policy decisions on the 
medium -term outlook, and we will, you know, be looking carefully at incoming data and, a s 
always , revising our outlook and policy plans as appropriate.  
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 23  
 SAM FLEMING.   Any implications for  beginning of runoff  and further increases in the 
fed funds rate?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So —continue , as today ’s actions show , to feel that the economy is 
doing well, is showing resilience .  We hav e a very strong labor market, an un employment rate 
that’s declined to levels we ha ve not seen since 2001.  And , even with some modera tion in the 
pace of job growth, we have a labor market that continues to strengthen and policy remains —
remains  accommodative.  So, I —it’ s important that inflation move up to our 2 percent objective , 
as our projections  show we cont inue to expect that and be lieve  the conditions are in place.  But 
we will monitor incoming data , obviously , and be attentive to rethinking our outlook if it seems 
appropriate.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres  from Bloomberg News.  Hate to belabor the point on 
inflation, but I was wondering, I hear a lot of the so- called NAIRU in your conversation now and 
in other committee members ’.  It’s an unobservable thing.  At best, it’ s an estimate.  And the 
assumptions in there seem to me that the economy today is much like the economy yeste rday, 
when , if anything , we’ve learned that the post -recession  economy is vastly different than it was 
before the recession.  So I ’m wondering , something you’ ve talked about i s to focus more on the 
change in inflation —actual inflation , and is it going up or is it going down , and basing policy 
more on that.  What would be the risk of that , and why not adopt that if you have such a long 
period of underperformance ? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation 
and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations.  
And, well, it is very difficult to pin down what is the longer -run normal rate of unemployment , 
and there ’s a great deal of uncertainty about it , and it ’s hard to pin down, especially given the 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 23  
 fact that the so -called Phillips curve  appears to be quite flat.  That means that inflation doesn ’t 
respond very much or very quickly to movements in unemployment.  Nevertheless, that 
relationship , I believe, remain s at work.  We have seen that operate historically.  Now, in the face 
of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low , and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors , but we certainly 
haven ’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation.  In light of that, the C ommittee 
has successively moved down its estimate of the normal longer -run rate of unemployment , and in 
this projection, it’ s moved down to 4.6 percent , a tenth lower than it  was last time.  So, while the 
unemployment rate is below that, it’ s not that much—it’ s not that much below it. 
ANA SWANSON.   Ana Swanson, t he Washington Post .  We saw measures of consumer 
and business confidence rise after inauguration on expectations tha t the A dministration would 
move quickly to introduce policy changes like tax cuts and infrastructure spending.  But some of 
those policy changes have been slower to materialize than initially expected.  How do you view the positive and negative risks  from policy changes to your outlook, and has your view changed 
on that at all i n the last six months ? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite 
strong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the  expected policy 
changes , such as changes to tax policy or  fiscal policy more generally.  I would say that , based 
on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts , that I haven ’t seen very much evidence that , thus far , expectations of policy changes 
have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending.  So I really wouldn’ t expect any significant pullback .  Many of our business contacts —I think their 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 23  
 confidence remains high.  They ’ve not really changed their plans yet , and they have a wait -and-
see attitude.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  Measures of 
financial cond itions show that since the F ed started raising interest rates two years ago, financial 
condi tions actually have loosened.  Consumer business borrowing costs in many cases are down.  
Do you have the sense that the market is not listening to you?  How much of a concern is that for 
you?  And , at some point, does it convince you that you need to rais e rates perhaps more 
quickly?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many 
different factors into account.  We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year.  That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions.  There’ s been a modest decrease 
recently in the value of the dollar , although it ’s up substantially since mid -2014.  So we take 
those factors into account in deriving our forecasts and deciding the appropriate stance of policy.  
We have done that , and —but other things also affect the stance of policy.  So there really can ’t 
be any simple relationship.  We ’re not targetin g financial conditions.  We ’re trying to set a path 
of the federal funds rate, but taking account of those factors and others that don’ t show up in a  
financial conditions index.  We’re trying to generate paths for employment and inflation that 
meet our man dated objectives. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So, on inflation again, I just 
wonder, what ’s the possibility that something more , sort of —I mean , nefarious is at work here, 
right, which is that the , sort of , weight of central bank credibility now —for a generation , really —
plus globalization has just pushed the world into a low -inflation environment that ’s going to be 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 23  
 very hard to get wages and prices moving again.  And then, related to  that, you know, if NAIRU 
is 4.2, why not 4 or why not 3.8?  You banked a quarter —you know, a full percentage point now , 
so you’ re probably at less risk of  falling behind whatever curve exists.  Why rush?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I don’ t think central  bank credibility —at least the F ed’s 
credibility —has been impaired.  We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation 
expectations .  Professional forecasters —whether it ’s in the B lue Chip or the S urvey of 
Professional F orecasters, those expectations have remained  quite steady and in close alignment 
with our 2 percent  inflation target.  TIPS -based  measures of inflation compensation do not 
provide straight reads on market participants ’ estimates and expectations about inflation.  They 
embody other elements —risk premia and liquidity premia as well.  They had moved down and 
now have moved—they remain at low levels , but they have moved back up again.  It is true that 
some household surveys of  inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn’ t say 
that we ’ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expect ations.  
But you asked also, I guess , about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation 
process , and that certainly is possible.  And estimates of the normal longer -run unemployment 
rate—they are quite uncertain.  I agree with your assessment there.  We ’re really not certain what 
they are.  And policy is not being —is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.  
We’re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs.  And, you know, I continue to 
believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess , even with the moderation of the 
level that ’s needed to provide for new entrants  in the labor market, we do have a strengthening 
economy .  With policy accommodative , all that we ’re doin g in raising rates is moving —
removing a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace.  And I see that a s appropriate.  
We’re not moving so aggressively as to put a br ake on continued improvement in the labor 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 23  
 market.  But I think that that ’s a prudent  move , to move in a gradual way to remove 
accommodation , with unemplo yment now —and not only , I should say , the unemployment rate , 
but I think any indicator of labor market performance and  tightness that you could look at , 
whether it ’s household perceptions  of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring 
workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings , all of these 
indicators do signal a tight labor mar ket. 
Now, with inflation below 2 percent , I think it’ s appropriate that the labor market be that 
tight.  But , on the other hand, I think we want to avoid the risk.  We want to keep the expansion 
on a sustainable path and avoid the risk that at some point we need—we find ourselves in a 
situation where we ’ve done nothing and then need to raise the funds rate so rapidly that we risk a 
recession.  So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the C ommittee believes , is an appropriate  
management of risks.  But we are attentive to the fact that inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , that we ’ve faced that  situation now for a long time , and it’ s really quite 
essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective , and it ’s a symmetric objective.  So that ’s a risk that we face as well.  The C ommittee 
believes we have conditions in place for inflation to move up, but that ’s also a risk .  And those 
things point , I think, to a gradual pace of reducing accommodation.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  
Recently, a group of economists sent  the F ed a letter earlier this  month disagreeing with your 
2 percent  inflation target and saying they would like the economy to run a bit hotter.  They don ’t 
think the labor market is so tight.  You  say you ’re committed to the 2 percent target, but what do 
you say to them?  
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 23  
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So, at  the time that we adopted the 2 percent  target —it was back in 
2012—we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation 
objective should be.  And, you know, I believe that was a well -thought -out decision.  Now, at the 
moment, we are highly foc used on trying to achieve our 2 percent  objective.  And we recognize 
the fact that inflation has been running below , and it ’s essential for us to move inflation back to 
that objective.  
Now, we ’ve learned a lot in the meantime , and assessments of the level of the neutral 
likely level , currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are 
quite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years.  And that means that the economy is —
has the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective.  So it ’s that recognition that causes  
people to think we might be better off with a higher inflation objective, and that ’s an important 
set—this is one of our most critical decision s and one we are attentive to evidence and outside 
thinking.  It’s one that we will be reconsidering at some future time.  And it ’s important for our 
decisions to be informed by a wide range  of views  and research which is ongoing inside and 
outside the F ed.  But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of 
benefits of a higher in— potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential cost s 
that could be associated with it.  It needs to be a balanced assessment.  But  I would say that this 
is one of the most important questions facing monetary policy around the world in the future , and 
we very much look forward to seeing research by economists that will help inform our future decisions on this. 
DON LEE .  Thank you.  Don Lee with the L .A. Times .  The F ed’s projections continue to 
show the longer -run federal funds rate at 3 percent.  The markets are expecting 2 percent .  How 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 23  
 big of a concern is that gap in your mind?  What are the reasons for the  disconnect?  And, you 
know, what are the implications and the risks for the real economy?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me first say , it’s not straightforward to determine exactly what 
expectations are embodied in market prices because there are t erm premia that affect these rates , 
and they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read.  That said, in part, 
expectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it ’s likely to 
evolve over time.  And views have changed about that over time , and  there is a good deal of 
uncertainty about it.  So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range  of 
uncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out.  
There’ s a good deal of uncertainty and—tha t reflects the, like —all the shocks that can affect the 
evolution of the economy , and also the fact, we ’re quite uncertain ourselves about what the 
likely —what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate.  
So we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current 
expectations.  And the median now stands at around 3 percent , but we have uncertainty about 
that.  Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is  lower than that.  And as 
I said in my opening statement, the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years.  But that remains uncertain , and I think that ’s 
something that market participants are trying to assess , and we will be as well.  
DON LEE .  But do you see greater  volatility in the markets as it adjust s to the difference 
in the gap between the expectation and what the F ed’s projections are for the  longer -run federal 
funds rate?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, our expectations are little changed.  I mean, the projections we 
released today are essentially identical to those.  And I think the market is aware of the  views of 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 23  
 participants  and is  assessing evidence itself to form their own views.  And it ’s imp ortant that the 
market take an independent look, and that we get to understand and see how market participants 
are interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy.  So it ’s not an unhealthy thing to have 
such a gap.  And , as I just said, our own view s are not set in stone but are likely to evolve as well 
over time.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Mart y Crutsinger, Associated Press .  Back in 2013, when 
you—the F ed first raised the possibility of trimming its bond purchases, it created a bit of 
turbulence in financial m arkets.  The taper tantrum caused  you to reassess your communication 
of that process .  This trimming of the bond holdings, though—the financial market s seem to be 
taking that in a better way.  If down the road, though, you see that there is more  of an adverse 
reaction, are you planning to make any changes, perhaps change the caps to $30 billion, in the $20 billion caps?  How do you assess how you’ ll handle that going forward?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since  our—at least 
since our 2014 normalization principles , that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual 
and predictable way.  And we have tried systematically to communicate more about how we would do that as our plans have evolved.  And today ’s ann ouncement is another step in 
providing further details about how we plan to proceed s o that when this plan does go into effect, 
no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work. 
I think that we —the plan is one that is consc iously intended to avoid creating market 
strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan.  My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it’ s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run 
quietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 23  
 balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it ’s something that the C ommittee 
will not be reconsidering from time to time.  We think this is a workable plan, and it will, as one 
of my colleagues, President Harker , described it, it will be like watching paint dry, that this will 
just be something that runs quietly in t he background.  So that ’s my expectation and our 
intention.  Look, of course, if it turns out that there is a surpr ise and a substantial reaction , that is 
something we would have to take into account in deciding on the appropriate stance of policy.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  A couple 
of comments from A dministration officials I wanted to get your reaction to .  The Treasury 
Secretary and others have suggested that Dodd- Frank regulation and the way it ’s been impl ied—
applied have restricted credit growth in the economy, banks are not making loans that they otherwise would, and that has slowed growth.  Do you agree with that?  And if you get a new Vice Chair of Supervision who wanted to ease up on regulation, would you go along with that?  
Also, I wanted to ask you —it’ s been reported the President has congratulated you on being a 
“low interest ” person.  Would you agree with that characterization of your philosophy?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, with respect to the impact of c redit con ditions and bank 
regulation on slow growth, I ’ve previously , in testifying , indicated that I don ’t think that our 
regulations have played an important role , at least broadly speaking , in impeding credit growth 
and the growth of the economy.  And I ’ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting 
that cred it growth continues to be  healthy, including among small —smaller community banks 
that are most concerned with regulatory burden.  I think when banks are undercapitalized and 
weak, that i mpedes credit growth.  And when banks are strong, they ’re in a much better position 
to lend.  So that ’s been a view that I ’ve stated previously.  
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 23  
 Now, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday , a detailed report.  
And that ’s quite a complicated document with lots of recommendations in it.  I haven ’t had a 
chance to review it thoroughly, so I don’ t want to comment on too many details.  But I would say 
it underscores the importance of capital , liquidity, stress testing, and re solution planning in 
having a safe and sound banking system , which are views that I and my colleagues have long 
espoused.  Regulatory burden, when it ’s possible to ease it , and a good deal of the Treasury 
report is focused on regulatory burden, that ’s some thing that all regulators should be looking to 
do.  We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity 
of institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks.  We have been focused and had a number of initiatives already in that direction, look ing for ways , for example, to 
simplify capital requirements for community banks.  And we ’ll continue in that direction and, in 
that sense, in those areas certainly share the views expressed in the Treasury repo rt.  So there are 
a number of areas and suggestions where our thinking aligns well.  There is probably some areas where we’ re likely to have differences but quite —you know, quite a number of areas where 
we’re, you know, likely to be able to and already are taking actions that are consistent with those 
recommendations. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  And the characterization of you as a low  interest rate person?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I have felt that it’ s been appropriate for interest rates to remain 
low for a very long time.  We are in the process of , as the economy strengthens , normalizing 
interest rates.  But, certainly, we ’ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low.  I 
thought it was necessary to support the economy at that time and was strongly in favor of those policies.  
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 23  
 KAREN MRACEK.   Thank you, Karen Mracek with Market News International.  Today 
you guys outlined the details of the plan to—when you begin to e nd reinvestments.  But you 
stopped short of saying exactly when it would be implemented, only saying “ this year, ” and 
adding that that depended on how the economy evolved.  Can you tell us why you decided not to 
go ahead with it today?  Is there certain conditions that you’ re looking for?  And then, as a 
second question, do you think that the —you could raise rates and begin implementation of the 
plan at the same time?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have tried as meticulously as we can to provide advanced 
warning to markets about how we would go about doing this so that market participants can prepare.  And today ’s announcement is another step in that process.  So we certainly wanted to 
get this information out before we actually undertake the beginning of this plan.  And, you know, as the statement says, we ’ve made no definite decision on the timing of the plan, but —the timing 
of initiating the plan.  But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations , which, you 
know, we will be watching —always are—we could put this into effect relatively soon.  You 
asked about w hether or not we would do that and raise rates at the same meeting, and I would 
say, we ’ve made no decision about that, and it really hinges on the outlook and our assessment of 
conditions. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  You mentioned the Treasury 
report , and I just wanted to ask, how much weight do you give those recommendations in 
considering, you know, potential regulatory changes moving forward?  And also, more specifically, one of the re commendations relates to the Volcker rule.  I know you ’ve said in the 
past that, you know, it might be a good idea to re duce the burden on community banks , but it 
also talks about potentially exempting banks with trading assets and liabilities above a certain 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 23  
 level.  And I was wondering if you think that that ’s an idea that ’s worth exploring , that might be 
a good idea.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have previously su ggested exempting community banks, 
smaller banks , entirely from the rule.  And a number of my colleagues have spoken about the 
Volcker r ule.  Implementation of it is frankly complex , and I ’m certainly open to looking at ways 
to reduce regulatory burden in that area.  The report endorses a restriction on proprietary trading.  
So, in that sense, it endorses the main objective of the Volcker rule, which I was pleased to see.  
But on implementation, it’ s true that the rules were—in part reflecting the way the legislation is 
written —were, I think, necessarily complex, but we do have some ideas for how we might 
simplify the rule , and certainly it ’s something we ’re quite open to looking at. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  And how much weight do you give Treasury recommendations?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mean, Treasury has a —set out a list of objectives for 
regulation that I ’m sympathetic to and endorse .  I think looking for ways to reduce regulatory 
burden, when it can be done without sacrificing safety and soundness or creating sys temic risk , 
that’s something that all regulators should want to do.  We ’ve done an awful lot of rule writing  
over the last five or six years.  And coming back and looking at where we have created burdens and ways in which we can simplify to reduce, that is  an objective that is core to the Treasury 
review and that we are very sympathetic with.  So, while we may not agree on every detail, certainly the suggestions that are made there are ones that we will pay attention to and in many cases are already on our own list of things we should review.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires.  In light of the plans to 
trim the balance sheet hopefully later this year, what have you learned about QE and your bond-buying policies as a tool for monetary policy ?  When they were launched, it wasn ’t something 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 23  
 you had, you know, engaged in on that scale before—a lot of fear s that  it was going to create 
hyperinflation .  That hasn ’t ever seem ed to come to pass.  So, in light of QE as potentially a tool 
for the future —you know, it might come back again—what have you learned about how it works 
in the economy?  Like, where do you see it affect things?  You know, what are sort of the lessons 
learned of the experience? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thanks.  That ’s a great question.  I mean, staff in the Federal 
Reserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate QE .  I think 
the general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer -
term interest rates, so -called ter m premiums embedded in longer -term interest rates.  There ’s 
disagreement among economists about exactly how large those effects are, and it ’s something 
that’s difficult to pin down.  But , obviously, it has not caused runaway inflation, quite the 
contrary.  I mean, that was never my expectation , but I do remember when people were afraid 
that that would happen. 
We do have the tools.  We have, you know, even with a large balance sheet —we intend 
to shrink our balance sheet now , but even with a large balance sheet, we retain the ability to 
move the fed funds rate and set it as appropriate for the needs of the economy.  So I think we 
have learned that it works.  It’s a valuable part of the toolkit.  It’s something that, if we were t o 
encounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where —I’ve said we want the fed funds 
rate and movements in short -term interest rates, that’ s our go- to number one main policy tool —
but if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly 
balance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe , based on the 
evidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit.  And we have said in the 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 23  
 bullets that we released today on our ba lance sheet that in such of —an episode of such extreme 
weakness in the future, those are things we would consider going forward.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  One small follow -up.  Is $4½ trillion sort of a natural limit to how 
high you might want to push the balance sh eet, or could you envision it going higher if you 
needed it to?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we ’ve had no discussion of that issue, you know.  And our 
focus now is on getting it back to a more normal size.  But I would say , the use of QE in the 
United States relat ive to the size of our economy is not as high as it ’s been in some other 
countries that have employed it.  But that ’s something we haven ’t seriously even discussed.  
PATRICK GILLESPIE.  Chair Yellen , Patrick Gillespie with CNN.  It’s workforce 
development w eek at the White House , and you highlighted several job training —successful job 
training programs in your speech in March.  The President ’s budget has a 40 percent  cut to job 
training programs.  What is your response to the budget cut  to job training programs even though 
they expect to expand apprenticeship programs?  And do you believe that job training programs 
and apprenticeships are needed to help fix the job skills gap in the economy?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I ’m not going to comment on the P resident ’s budget , and these 
programs can be undertaken at many different levels.  I’ve seen many nonprofits and states and 
local authorities put in place programs that looked to me to be successful.  I do think we have a 
tight labor market and one where employers have jobs where they ’re finding difficulty 
identifying workers with the appropriate skills.  In my own discussions with businesses, what I 
hear more of —and this is something I think is a great aspect of a tight labor market —larger firms 
are spending more on tr aining and trying to, given that they can’ t hire workers with the ideal 
skills, are training people to fill jobs that they have available.  What I hear from CEOs of smaller 
June 14, 2017  Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 23  
 firms is that they don ’t have the ability to launch such programs.  They would real ly very much 
like to participate along , for example, with community colleges or nonprofits to see such 
programs launched and have jobs that people could fill if they received the appropriate training.  
So I do think that this is an important area, and, especially given the pressures that have, you 
know, existed for a long time —downward pressure on wages and job opportunities, especially 
for those with less skills —I think that this is something that deserves priority.

Page 1 of 25  Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference  
September 20, 2017  
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  At our meeting that concluded earlier today, my 
colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 1 to 1 ¼ percent.  This accommodative policy should support some 
further strengthening in the job market and a return to 2 percent inflation, consistent with our statutory o bjectives.  We also decided that in October we will begin the balance sheet 
normalization program that we outlined in June.  This program will reduce our securities 
holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.  I’ll have more to say about these decisions 
shortly, but first I’ll review recent economic developments and the outlook. 
As we expected, and smoothing through some variation from quarter to quarter, 
economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.  Household spending has been 
supported by ongoing strength in the job market.  Business investment has picked up, and exports have shown greater strength this year, in part reflecting improved economic conditions abroad.  Overall, we expect that the economy will continue to expand at a moderat e pace over 
the next few years.  
In the third quarter, however, economic growth will be held down by the severe 
disruptions caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  As activity resumes and rebuilding gets under  way, growth likely will bounce back.  Ba sed on past experience, these effects are 
unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy beyond the next couple of quarters.  Of course, for the families and communities that have been devastated by the storms, recovery will take time, and  on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sympathy for 
all those who have suffered losses. 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 25  In the labor market, job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the three months ending 
in August —a solid rate of growth that remained well above estimate s of the pace necessary to 
absorb new entrants to the labor force.  We know from some timely indicators , such as initial 
claims for unemployment insurance , that the hurricanes severely disrupted the labor market in 
the affected areas, and payroll employmen t may be substantially affected in September.  
However, such effects should unwind relatively quickly.  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has 
stayed low in recent months and, at 4.4 percent in August, was modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer -run normal level.  Participation in the labor force has 
changed little, both recently and over the past four years.  Given the underlying downward trend in participation stemming largely from the aging of the U.S. population, a relative ly steady 
participation rate is a further sign of improving conditions in the labor market.  W e expect that 
the job market will strengthen somewhat further.  
Turning to inflation, the 12- month change in the price index for personal consumption 
expenditures was 1.4 percent in July, down noticeably from earlier in the year.  Core inflation—which excludes the volatile food and energy categories —has also moved lower.  For quite some 
time, inflation has been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run obje ctive.  
However, we believe this year’s shortfall in inflation primarily reflects developments that are largely unrelated to broader economic conditions.  For example, one -off reductions earlier this 
year in certain categories of prices, such as wireless t elephone services, are currently holding 
down inflation, but these effects should be transitory.  Such developments are not uncommon and, as long as inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, are not of great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away.  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 25  Similarly, the recent hurricane -related increases in gasoline prices will likely boost 
inflation, but only temporarily.  More broadly, with employment near assessments of its 
maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the Committee continues to expect inflation to move up and stabilize around 2 percent over the next couple of years, in line with our longer -run objective.  Nonetheless, our understanding of the forces driving 
inflation is imperf ect, and in light of the unexpected lower inflation readings this year, the 
Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.  As always, the Committee is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed to achieve its inflation and employment objectives  over the 
medium term.  
Let me turn to the economic projections that Committee participants submitted for this 
meeting, which now extend through 2020.  As always, participants conditioned their projections on their own individual views of appropriate moneta ry policy , which, in turn, depend on each 
participant’s assessment s of the many factors that shape the outlook.  The median projection for 
growth of inflation -adjusted gross domestic product , or real GDP , is 2.4 percent this year and 
about 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  By 2020, the median growth projection moderates to 1.8 percent, in line with its estimated longer -run rate.  The median projection for the 
unemployment rate stands at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and runs a little above 4 per cent over the next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its longer -run normal 
rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection is 1.6 percent this year, 1.9 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020.  Compared with the projections made  in June, real GDP growth is a 
touch stronger this year , and inflation—particularly core inflation —is slightly softer this year 
and next.  Otherwise, the projections are little changed from June. 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 25  Returning to monetary policy, although the Committee decided at this meeting to 
maintain its target for the federal funds rate, we continue to expect that the ongoing strength of 
the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer -run objective.  That expectation is based on our 
view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level —that is, the level that 
is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel.  Because the neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral policy stance.  But because we also expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Even so, the Committee continues to anticipate that the longer -run neutral level of 
the federal funds rate is likely to remain  below levels that prevailed in previous decades.  
This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.  
The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1.4 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent at the end of nex t year, 2.7 percent at the end of 2019, and 2.9 percent in 2020.  Compared with 
the projections made in June, the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged, although the median estimate of the longer -run normal value edged down to 2.8 percent.  
As always, the economic outlook is highly uncertain, and participants will adjust their 
assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to their economic outlooks and views of the risks to their outlooks.  Policy is not on a preset  course.  
As I noted, the Committee announced today that it will begin its balance sheet 
normalization program in October.  This program, which was described in the June addendum to 
our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually decrease our reinvestments of 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 25  proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency securities.  As a 
result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.  For October through December, 
the decline in our securities holdings will be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasuries and 
$4 billion per month for agencies.  These caps will gradually rise over the course of the 
following year to maximums of $30 billion per month for Treasuries and $20 billion per month 
for agency securities and will remain in place through the process of normalizing the size of our 
balance sheet.  By limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as 
we reduce our holdings, the caps should guard against outs ized moves in interest rates and other 
potential market strains.  
Finally, as we have noted previously, changing the target range for the federal funds rate 
is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  Our balance sheet is not 
intended to be an active tool for monetary policy in normal times.  We therefore do not plan on 
making adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program.  But, of course, as we stated in 
June, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a materi al deterioration in the 
economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.  
Thank you.  I’d be  happy to take your questions. 
CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Chair Yellen,  there ’s 
been extraordinary progress during your term as Chair in lowering  several measures of 
unemployment and underemployment , and all while inflation has remained subdued.  B ut some 
people are even asking , why stop there ?  Bill Spriggs , the chief economist at  the AFL -CIO, who 
I think you know well, criticized the F ed last week for seeking to maintain unemployment above 
4 percent , which he notes necessarily means keeping the unemployment rate among black 
Americans above 8 percent .  He described this as a deliberate policy to sacrifice many h undreds 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 25  of thousands of potential workers and their families out of fear of future inflation, when in fact 
the Fed ’s preferred measure of inflation has not exceed ed 3 per cent in more than 25 years.  So 
I’m wondering how you would respond to his frustration over the Fed ’s desire to continue 
raising rates when core inflation really shows no sign of heading above the Fed ’s symmetric goal 
for inflation.  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.   So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our 
mandate.  We ’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have 
taken that very seriously.  I’m very pleased and heartened by the i mprovement we have seen in 
the labor market, and  at 4.4 percent, t he unemployment rate has  really fallen to quite a low level.  
As that ’s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor m arket , 
particularly African  Americans and Hispanics, ha s fallen more dramatically than that for the 
nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the 
financial crisis and G reat R ecession hit.  A nd these are really very positive development s.  So we 
certainly seek a strong labor m arket, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and 
unemployment , and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a  2 percent inflation 
objective over the medium term. 
Now, I recognize and it ’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent 
objective for a number of years , and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into 
lower inflation expectations.  For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor m arket —which , my judgment 
would be , has largely disappeared —very large reductions in energy prices , and a large 
appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid -2014.  This year, the 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 25  shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative , is more of a 
mystery, and I will not say that the C ommittee clearly understands what the causes are of that.  
Now, we do , in our regular projection, show fan charts indicating the typical size of 
forecast errors .  All of the variables —GDP, t he unemploymen t rate , and inflation —are forecast 
by ourselves and private forecasters with errors , and so there is variation in these economic 
variables fro m year to year.  I would say our  judgment , as I said in the statement, is that the 
shortfall is not largely relate d to cyclical considerations.  You can see from the projections that 
the C ommittee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will 
move up close to our 2 percent objective next year —namely , that the shortfall this year is du e to 
transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year . 
But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent .  
And as we watch incoming data, the assessments that you see participants wr ite down about the 
path of the federal funds r ate, they are not set in stone .  They are not definite plans.  We will look 
at incoming data on inflation and on other economic variables, including the labor m arket , in 
deciding what we should actually do going f orward .  And if it proves contrary to our 
expectations that the shortfall is persistent, it will be necessary to adjust monetary policy to 
address that.  But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 
2 percent, whic h we need to take account of in monetary policy , monetary policy also operates 
with a  lag.  And experience suggests that tightness in the labor  market , gradually and with a  lag, 
tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that ’s also a risk , that we want to be careful not to 
allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere do wn the road, 
to have to tighten m onetary policy rapidly , which could cause a recession a nd threaten the very 
desirable labor m arket conditio ns that we have now. 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 25  SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming  from the Financial Times .  The 
Fed’s staff spoke recently about  elevated asset prices in the mark ets in the most recent —in the  
meeting  before th is one held today.  How are buoyant market conditions affecting the debate at 
the moment about how quickly to rein in stimulus?  And have they , in your own mind, helped to 
counter some of the concerns you’ve had about the inflation s hortfalls that we ’ve been seeing ?  
Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLEN.   So at  every  meeting  we try to assess the economic o utlook and take 
account of information that ’s been accumulated about the real economy and also developments 
in financial markets and put all of that together in assessing the course of the economy.  So 
developments affecting asset prices and longer -term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of 
those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking . 
But it’ s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall 
outlook.  Sometimes mo vements —upward movements in asset prices can,  for example, reflect a 
change in market participants ’—reduction in market participants ’ estimates of the longer -run 
level of interest rates.  So there has been —there have been downward revisions both to the 
Committee ’s and to market participants ’ estimates of the longer -run normal level of interest 
rates , which in turn reflects in some sense a  view that , going out many years , aggregate demand 
globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growt h and aging populations .  
And, of course , we don’ t know if that view is correct, but that ’s a factor that could be reflected —
could be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have.  So , you know, why are asset 
prices moving ?  That’s important in dete rmining the impact on the overall outlook, but , certainly , 
we are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy. 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 25  STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman , CNBC.  Madam C hair, you just said in your 
opening remarks that reducing the balance sheet sh ould not be “ an active tool for monetary 
policy in normal times, ” you don’ t plan to make adjustments to the balance  sheet .  I’m 
wondering if we could explore if there ’s any sensitivity to the plan you just announced if there ’s 
a spike in interest rates, a plunge i n the stock market, weakness in  growth.  
In the June statement , you indicated that the only reason why you would change the —it 
suggested  the only reason you’d change the balance sheet is if it required , first , a change i n the 
funds rate.  Is that true ?  If there ’s some unexpected development in markets , or, for example, 
given that we don’ t know what the plans are on the fiscal side for the deficit in terms of tax 
cuts—there could be a sudden spike in the deficit —will the balance sheet reduction plan be 
immune to all of that ?  And, given t hat question, and the idea that  this has  never been done 
before, why so much certainty about the plan you’ve just announced and apparent unwillingness 
to adjust it?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use:  the 
balance sheet and adjustments in  short -term interest rates —our  federal funds rate target .  And, 
historically , the C ommittee has  operated t o adjust monetary conditions to meet our economic 
goals when there are shocks to the economy by adjusting  the federal funds r ate—our  short -term 
interest rate target.  And that ’s something —a technique of monetary control that we  have  used 
for a very long time that we are familiar with, we believe we understa nd pretty well what  the 
effects are on the economy, market participants understand how that tool has been used and 
would likely be adjusted in response to shocks to the economy .  And our preference is , when we 
have two different tools that we could use to actively adjust the stance of policy, to  prefer and to 
make a commitment that, to t he maximum extent possible , the federal funds r ate will be the 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 25  active tool of policy.  That ’s our go- to tool .  That is what we intend to use unless we think that 
the threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate—
after all , we’ve moved it up to 1 to 1¼ percent  and expect it to go up further —but a very 
significant negativ e shock to the economy could conceivably force us bac k to the so- called zero 
lower bound.  We have said if there were that type of  material deterioration in the o utlook where 
we cou ld face a situation where the federal funds r ate isn ’t a su fficient tool fo r us to adjust 
monetary p olicy, we might stop—we might stop r oll-offs from our balance sheet and resume 
reinvestment .  But as long as we believe that we can use the federal funds rate as a tool , that is 
what we intend to do. 
So, if there are small changes in the outlook t hat require a recalibration of monetary 
policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not , for 
example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop —continue  reinvestment for a few months and 
then change it.  We think that provides greater clarity to market participants about how policy will be conducted and will be , will be  less confusing and more eff ective in terms of conducting 
policy.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.   Binya Appelbaum , the New York Times .  You  have  now 
committed to a policy of reducing your balance sheet very gradually.  You have described plans to raise interest rates even more gradually than previously.  You are locked in for a long period of time to a forecast that monetary p olicy will essentiall y keep interest rates at a low level and 
keep a balance sheet at a high level.  If something goes wrong , does the F ed have room to 
respond under these conditions in the next several years , and could you describe for us what your 
plans are for a response , should it be warranted?  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 25  CHAIR YELLEN.  So the only t hing I would object to there , is you said that we are 
“locked in,”  and I would say that we are not locked in.  We believe that economic conditions will 
evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in  our federal funds rate target, but if 
conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be —it mig ht be that 
growth is more rapid, t he labor m arket tightens more quickly than we assume, an d inflation 
appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected —we have not promised, no matter 
what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.  We believe that that will be 
appropriate , but we  always watching the economy and  will adjust policy as appropriate.  
Now, as I said, the hurdle to changing our plans with respect to the balance sheet , in some 
sense , is high.  If conditions were to weaken, we  would really only consider resuming 
reinvestment if it were what we refer to as a material deterioration , and I tried to explain why 
that is .  But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy .  What you see in the dot plot is each 
participant ’s best guess, based on the information they have today , about what will be 
appropriate in light of their expectations about how the econom y would evolve .  And we think 
it’s helpful to show the public some sense that it helps in understanding our evaluation of the 
economy .  But we ’re assessing incoming data, and these p lans are subject to change.  W hat’s not 
subject to change is our commitmen t to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that 
Congress has  assigned to u s, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum 
employment.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM .  Do you, in fact , have room in the next two or three years to 
respond to an economic downturn?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So , certainly , if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more 
rapidly , we have room.  We have a certain amount of room now , and we have raised the funds 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 25  rate four times.   We believe that we are on a path where ther e will likely be further increases 
over the next couple of years, which will give us greater room , and we think the recovery is on a 
strong track.  So the reason for our actions today in beginning to run down the balance sheet is, 
we think the economy is performing well and we have confidence in the outlook for the real economy .  But, of course , there are shocks , and if the negative shock to the economy were 
sufficient, we recognize that we might be unable to pursue objective s purely by cutting the 
federal funds r ate, and that is why we say explicitly that we would be prepared , in that event, to 
resume reinvestment , and other tools that we used in the financial crisis —forward guidance —
would also be available to us. 
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Nick Timiraos  of the  Wall S treet Journal .  Chair Yellen , Fed 
Governor Lael Brainard recently gave a speech in which she said trend inflation appeared to 
have moved lower by around ½ percentage point.  I wanted to ask , do you agree?  And what 
would the F ed need to do , if anything , to boost trend inflation if it has  fallen?  And , related to 
that, you’ve said you expect the inflation softness this year to prove “ transitory. ”  Compared to 
three months ago, how firm is your curr ent expectation that the slowdown will remain transitory , 
and what implications would that have for monetary policy if it is  not? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So the term “ trend inflation ”—usually there are a variety of statistical 
techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.   Exactly what that means is, in some 
sense , a statistical thing, and there are methodologies that would show some modest decline in 
recent year s in the trend.  After all, we’ve had a numbe r of years in which inflation has  been low.  
As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you g o back to, s ay, 2013 and consider the —
until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand.  It’s a combination 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 25  of slack in the labor m arket, declines in energ y prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down 
import price inflation. 
So what ’s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.  By 
some —by many—by some survey measures of professional forecasters, those have been rock 
solid.  We do also look at household expectations, which have come down some.  Market -based 
measures of inflation c ompensation, as we mentioned in the statement —they have declined, and 
they’ve been stable in recent months, but they ’ve declined to levels that are low by historical 
standards.  That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can’ t get a 
clear read —the re are risk premia built into inflation c ompensation that make it impossible to 
extract directly what inflation expectations are.  
So, you know, there is a miss this year .  I can ’t say I can easily poin t to a sufficient set of 
factors that explain this year why inflation has been this  low.  I’ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic 
things, but , frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things.  The fact 
that inflation is unusually l ow this year does not mean that that ’s going to continue.  Remember 
that in January and February, core inflation was running over a 12- month basis at around 1.9 
percent, and we look to be very close to 2 now.  We ’ve had several months of data that have 
meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is  figure out whether or not the factors 
that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they ’re likely to prove transitory, and 
that’s what we ’re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data . 
And you asked me about the policy implications.  Of course, if we determined our view 
changed, and instead of thinking that the factors holding inflation down were transitory , we came 
to the view that they would be persistent, it would re quire an alteration in monetary policy to 
move inflation back up to 2 percent, and we would be committed to making that adjustment.  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 25  ANN SAPHIR .  Hi, Ann Saphir with Reuters.  I wanted to ask you, market s seem to be 
pricing in still a shallow er path of rate  hikes than the F ed does in the SEP, and I wonder , what do 
you think that markets might be missing here , and, sort of , what ’s your conviction about, you 
know, that your view is the correct one on the gradual —the pace that “ gradual ” means, which 
seems to be a little bit faster than what markets are pricing?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I ’m not really going to try to explain what market participants are 
thinking.  I thin k all of us —both market and FOM C participant s’ paths have come down.  N ot in 
the last couple of quart ers, but over the last several years , there’ s been a growing recognition that 
the so -called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum 
employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and  
research bearing on this topic suggest that it ’s quite low.  
Market —SEP —the FOMC participants —you can see by their estimates of the longer -run 
normal rate of interest, it is —this time it came down from—the median came down from  3 
percent to 2.75 percent.  So that shows that even in the long run, FOM C participants, in light of 
incoming data, are adjusting their views.  I would say they still believe that,  in real terms, that 
neutral rate will be rising somewhat over the next few years .  With a 2 percent inflati on rate , that 
long-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or 
slightly positive rates now.  So that ’s one factor that explains the path in the SEP.  Market 
participants may have lower estimates or believe that a low neutral rate may be more persistent.  
I mean, let me emphasize that , as I said before, there’ s nothing set in stone about the 
policy paths that you see in the summary of projections .  There’ s a great deal of uncertainty 
around them.  Not only is there disagreement, th ere’s also uncertainty, and FOM C participants 
have been revising their views over time, and they wi ll continue to do so.  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 25  I’d also point out a couple of technical reasons why it ’s difficult to compare what you see 
in the SEP and marke t-implied paths.  One is that FOM C participants are writing down what 
they think is the most  likely , or modal , outcome for rates .  But, of course , there are downside 
risks .  And the mean rate , if they were asked to write that down, would take account of weighing 
all possible outcomes and likely would be lower than what participants are writing down as the ir 
most likely outcome.  In addition, in markets , many economists have suggested that there  are 
term premia that can affect moving from the so -called market -implied path to the view for what 
the future federal funds rate path is, and if those term premia are negative , as many economists 
think they likely are, there ’s a little bit less difference  between what you see in the FOMC plot 
and the market -implied  plot. 
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Thanks.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times .  Chair Yellen, 
your term expires as C hair in February .  Have you had a chance to meet with or discuss your 
situation with Pr esident Trump yet?  And if so, what were your impressions of him and what he ’s 
looking for from the Federal Reserve?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I have said that I intend to serve out my term as C hair, and that 
I’m really not going to comment on my intentions beyond that.  I will say that I have not had a 
further meeting with President Trump.  I met with him early in my term, and I ’ve not had a  
further meeting with him.1 
ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro, Fox Business.  Chair Yellen , a month ago you 
delivered a speech in Wyoming in which you said, “T he balance of research suggests that the 
core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting 
credit availability or economic growth. ”  I have a two-part question based on that  quote.  First, 
                                                 
1 Chair Yellen intended to say that she met with President Trump early in his term.  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 25  what message do you want Congress and President Trump to hear from that statement?  And 
then, regarding economic growth, the accommodative process that the F ed has followed for the 
last 10 years has helped bri ng us to full employment, but economists point out that there have 
been people who haven ’t benefited .  For instance , 52 percent of Americans own stock , 48 
percent don ’t—they’ve not participated in the gains in the stock market.   Housing prices —the 
median h ouse price is now at a record high, and 39 million Americans , according to a Harvard 
study, spend more than 30 percent for housing.  So what would you say to those people about Fed policies and the impact they ’ve had on their lives?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So you asked me , what was the main —first , what was the 
main message of my speech, and I would say it ’s that we put in place, since the financial crisis, a 
set of core reforms that have strengthened the financial system, and , in my personal view, it ’s 
impor tant they remain in place .  And those core reforms are more capital, higher -quality capital, 
more liquidity —especially in systemically important banking institutions —stress testing, and 
resolution plans .  And those four prongs of improvements in banking supervision have really 
strengthened the financial system and made it more resilient, and I believe they should stay in place.  
But I also tried to emphasize —and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the 
availability of credit.  I’ve also tried t o emphasize that all regulators should be attentive to undue 
regulatory burden and look for ways to try to scale that back.  A nd this is especially true after 
years in which we have implemented  a large number of complex regulations, and we have been 
committed to doing that.  I would point out particularly community banks that are laboring under 
significant regulatory burden.  W e have been looking for ways to scale back burdens, running the 
EGRPRA  process , where we ’ve listened to concerns among community banks and are looking 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 25  for ways, for example , to simplify capital standards and reduce burdens, and that ’s very 
important.  
More generally, we want to tailor —we want to , and  we would like to see Congress as 
well—we can do things to appropriately tailor regulati ons to the risk posed by different kinds of 
banking organizations.  There are  some things that  Congress could also do to help that process, 
and we have made some concrete suggestions .  And then  some of the regulations that we have 
put in place with other regulators since the crisis, like the Volcker rule, are really quite complex, 
and we ’re working —we believe we should —and we ’re working with other regulators to try to 
see if we can find ways , while carrying out what Dodd- Frank  intended, that banking 
organizations not be involved in proprietary trading .  Nevertheless , the implementation can be 
less complex.  So that was  my main message.  
Your second questi on asked about what impact the F ed has had on income distribution 
because of the fact that stocks and homes tend to be disproportionate ly owned .  So, I would say , 
look, we were faced with a huge recession that took an enormous toll in terms of depriving large 
numbers of people —and disproportionatel y lower -income people who are less advantaged in the 
labor m arket —found themselves without work.  We had a 10 percent unemployment rate, and 
our congressional mandate is maximum employment and price stability.  So we set monetary policy not with a view tow ard affecting the distribution of income, but toward pursuing those 
congressionally mandated goals . 
And I am pleased to see the unemployment rate and every other measure that I know of 
pertaining to the labor m arket show dramatic improvement over these years, and that is hugely 
important to the economic well- being not at the top end of the  wealth and income distribution, 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 25  but to the bottom end of the income distribution .  And w e have seen this year median income in 
real terms rise significantly , with gains throughout the income distribution. 
MART IN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger , Associated Press.  Madam Chair, the next 
month, with the departure of Vice Chair Fis cher, the Fed ’s going to lose its quorum —the F ed 
Board—you’ll go to three members.  Do  you have —is that going to present operational 
challenges for you?  Do have contingency plans?  Has the Senate assured you that Mr. Quarles 
will be —his confirmation will be approved?  And in your discussions with the Administration, 
have they given you any  assurances that the pace of nominations is going to pick up soon?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So first let me say that I will greatly miss Vice Chair Fis cher.  He ’s 
made enormous contributions to t he FOMC  and to the broader work of the Federal Reserve, and 
I have real ly enjoyed working with him and appreciated his wise counsel and friendship.  It is 
conceivable that we will be down to three Governors.  I have full confidence that even if that 
happens, we will be able to carry out our compleme nt of responsibilities.  Th ere’s—every action 
that we are allowed to take under the Federal Reserve Act can be taken, even if we are a B oard 
of three , although we will have to abide, as we always do, by the restrictions that are part  of the 
Government  in the Sunshine  Act.  
I would welcome a full complement of colleagues.  We have a lot of work to do, and it 
would be nice to distribute it over more people .  But, perhaps more important than that, I think 
it’s very important to have a broad range of views around the table as we  deliberate on policy 
actions.  I’ve had very good interactions with Randy Quarl es and hope he will be confirmed.  I 
look forward to working with him , and, you know, I hope that the Administration will make 
other nominations to fill our slots. 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 25  HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post .  As you know, Congress is 
considering a major tax reform package.  Do you or any of the C ommittee members have 
concerns if that package does not end up being deficit neutral and ends up adding to the debt?  
Would t hat be problematic for the economy?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  Look, that ’s something that ’s a matter for Congress and the White 
House to decide.  You know, I ’ve put forward  a few principles about fiscal policy that I would 
reiterate, that one of the problems that the  American economy suffers from, along with many 
other economies around the globe, is slow productivity growth, and I think it would be very desirable if a fiscal package had the potential in it to create incentives that would raise productivity growth.  We do face, in terms of longer -term deficits as the population ages, an 
unsustainable debt path that will require, I beli eve, some adjustments to fiscal p olicy, and I hope 
Congress will keep that in mind .  But beyond a few core principles, it ’s really —I don’ t want to 
weigh in on details.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Mars hall-Genzer  from Marketplace.  When 
you testified before Congress last July, you said that you might be prepared to take enforcement actions against Wells Fargo if it proved to be appropriate.  Do you think it ’s appropriate, and 
what actions could you take?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So let me say that I consider the behavior of Wells Fargo towards its 
customers to have been egregious and unacceptable.  We take our supervision responsibilities at the company very seriously, and we are attempting to understand what the root causes of those problems a re and to address them .  I’m not able to discuss confidential supervisory information 
and not yet able to tell you what actions we may take, but I do want to say that we are committed 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 25  to taking the actions we regard as necessary and appropriate to make sur e that the right set of 
controls are in place in that organization. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Can you give me any kind of a timeline?  
CHAIR YELLEN.  We are working very hard on it . 
DAVID HARRISON.  Hi, thank you.  David Harrison with Dow Jones.  I’d like to follow  
up on the balance s heet question , if I may.  What specifically would it take for you to reverse the 
decision to wind down the balance s heet, and under what conditions would you consider adding 
to the balance s heet again ?  And s eparately , as a follow -up to that, looking more broadly, how do 
you think history will judge the effectiveness of your asset purchases an d the conditions under 
which that  policy should be used?  Thank you.  
CHAIR YELLEN.  So , starting with the last part of the question, I mean, my own 
judgment, based on my experience and  the economic research that has tried to estimate the 
effectiveness of our balance s heet actions starting in 2008 and has also looked at the similar 
balance s heet actions in other parts of the world, including the  euro area, is that these actions 
were successful in making financial conditions more accommodative and , I believe, in 
stimulating a faster recovery than we otherwise would ha ve had .  A recent Fed working paper 
estimated that the full set of balance s heet actions that we took during the crisis may have 
lowered long -term interest rates by about 100 basis points.  O bviously , there are different —there 
are different estimates around—of what  difference it made, but I would say that it ’s effective.  
It will b e up to future policymakers to decide, in the event of a severe downturn, whether 
they think it ’s appropriate to again resort to balance sheet —to adding assets to a balance sheet.  I 
would say that if economists are correct that we’ re living in a world w here the level of neutral 
interest rates not only in the United States, but around the world is likely to be low in the future 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 25  due to slow productivity growth and demographics —now , we don’ t know that that view will 
bear out to be correct, but it is a view th at many people adhere to when there is evidence of it —
then future policymakers will be faced with the question of, in the event of a severe downturn 
where they ’re not able to provide as much stimulus as they would ideally like by cutting 
overnight interest  rates, what other actions are available to them ? 
And during the crisis , we bought longer -term assets and used forward guidance, and for 
my own part, I would want to keep those things in the toolkit as being available.  It will be up to 
future policymakers  to decide how to rank those, or whether or not there might be other options 
that are available to them, but I don’ t think this issue will go away, although perhaps it ’s only —
well, this could well be a decision that future policymakers will have to face in  the event of a 
significant asset —economic shock. 
I mean, you asked me what would it take for us to resume reinvestment, and I can’ t really 
say much more than we said in the guidance that we provided, which is that if there is a material 
deterioration in the economic outlook and we thought we might be faced with a  situation where 
we would  need to substantially cut the f ederal f unds r ate and could be limited by the so -called 
zero lower bound, it is that type of determination that our C ommittee is saying would —might 
lead us to resume reinvestment.  
So that ’s—our C ommittee has been unanimous  in affirming  this statement of intentions, 
so, y ou know, I think that ’s where our C ommittee stands .  So that is a somewhat high bar to 
resume reinvestments, and that ’s why , in answering previous questions, I would say , well, yo u 
know, if there’s  some small, negative  shock, our first tool —our most import ant and reliable 
tool—will be the federal funds r ate.  B ut if there is a significant shock that’s a  material 
deterioration to the outlook, we would consider resuming reinvestment.  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 25  VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi , Chair Yellen .  Victoria Guida with Politico.  You ’ve been on 
the Financial Stability Oversight Council for a few years now, and I was wondering if you had 
any thoughts on whether the designation process for S ystemically Important F inancial 
Institutions  should be changed or improved in any way .  And a somewh at separate, but related , 
question:   The situation with Equifax —I was wondering if there ’s anything related to that that 
might raise systemic issues that FSOC  would need to discuss. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So you asked first about the designation process.  So during the time 
that I ’ve been on the FSOC, only one firm was —several firms were designated before I 
participated.  MetLife was designated during the time that I was there, and I  have seen how the 
designation process works. 
I do think designation is important.  We saw during the financial crisis that some 
systemically important nonbanking organizations like Lehman and AIG —that their distress 
produce d broad systemic consequences that were adverse for the U .S. economy .  And having the 
ability to designate firms wh en the FSOC makes the determination that their distress or failure 
could have systemic repercussions, I believe that ’s an important —that ’s an important policy tool 
for FSOC to have available.  
Now, it’ s not meant to be a one -way street , in the sense that a firm that ’s designated —the 
procedures require annual reviews.  Firms may change their business models or just how they conduct their business, and we should welcome de -designation of firms if their business model is 
changed in a way that leads us to believe that their failure or distress would no longer be systemically important and those are decisions that we make every year.  
So, you know, I ’m satisfied with that process  so far.  GE Capital dramatically changed its 
business model  and was de- designated , and, you know, I believe it ’s a process that works.  So I 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 25  know that the T reasury is looking at this and may make recommendations, and if they do, I’d be, 
you know, glad to consider them as, you know, part of the FSOC process, but I think it ’s been 
importa nt and basically working.  
You asked about Equifax and, you know , of course that is a very serious data breach.  We 
would really urge consumers now to be very careful in monitoring their credit reports and 
financial situation .  And, through our supervision, we’re working with the banks that we 
supervise to make sure that they take appropriate actions with respect to their business processes in light of the fact that there could be breaches or fraudulent transactions or information that they received that the y might use —for example, in credit determinations —could be contaminated by 
bad data .  More generally, it points to the importance of strong cybersecurity controls and 
attention to cybersecurity risks, which we do see as one of the most significant risks to the financial sector .  And we are very focused in our banking supervision in making sure that banks 
have appropriate controls in place .  And the Equifax breach, I think, highlights the importance 
of that.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Telev ision and Radio.  We ’ve 
talked a lot today about what you ’re going to do and what you may do, but not necessarily about 
why.  With four rate increases behind you, financial conditions are looser than before you began.  And I’m wondering if that bothers you, if you’ re concerned about overstimulating the economy, 
or if you feel inflation could break out much more quickly than we have seen, or if you feel there’ s a financial stability question because stocks, bonds, and real estate are all so expensive 
now.  How would you explain what the Fed is doing, why the F ed is doing it , to the American 
people?  
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 25  CHAIR YELLEN.  So , first of all , let me say that the decisions that we ’ve made this year 
about rates and today about our balance sheet are ones we’ ve taken because we feel the U .S. 
economy is performing well.  We are working down our balance sheet because we feel that ’s 
stimulus that in some sense is no longer needed.  So the basic message here is , U.S. economic 
performance has been good .  The labor m arket has st rengthened subst antially.  Every measure of 
the labor m arket, whether it ’s the narrow unemployment rate, the broader unemployment rate, 
the number of people working in part -time jobs who want full -time work, the level of job 
openings, the quit  rate, the di fficulty that firms are facing in hiring workers, the level of 
confidence we see in surveys about the labor m arket —all of that is pointing to vast and 
conti nuing improvement in the labor m arket . 
And we see sufficient strength in the economy , in terms of spending —that grow th, with 
its ups and downs, but nevertheless is strong enough—looks to be strong enough in the medium  
term to support ongoing improvement in the labor m arket .  And all of that is good, and I think 
that the American people sho uld feel the steps we ’re tak ing to normalize monetary policy are 
ones that we feel are well justified, given the very substantial progress we ’ve seen in the 
economy. 
Now, inflation is running below where we want it to be, and we ’ve talked about that a lot 
during this —the last hour.  This past year , where it’s  not clear what the reasons are— I think it ’s 
not been mysterious in the past, but , one way or another , we have had four or five years in which 
inflation is running below our 2 percent objective , and we are also committed to achieving that.  
So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in 
our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that 
September 20, 2017  Chair Yellen’s  Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 25 of 25  we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 per cent and to maintain a strong labor 
market on a sustainable basis . 
And in making these judgments about the path of policy, we have to balance various 
risks.  One risk is that if we tighten policy too quickly, we may find out that , although we don ’t 
think this now, that the inflation shortfall is something that’ s going to be persistent .  And if we 
tighten too quickly, we could undermine inflation performance —leave it at too low a level —
inflation expectations could fall , and that could become ingrained, and that would be dangerous.  
And so that ’s a reason to be cautious about raising interest rates when inflation is as low as it is.  
But, on the other hand, we have a strong labor m arket and a low unemployment rate .  
And al though the pace of job gains is not quite as strong this year as , for example, as it was in 
2016, we ’re still averaging 175,000 jobs a month this year, which is quite a bit above the pace of 
maybe 100 to 120,000 that would be consistent with a stable unemp loyment rate if labor force 
participation begins to move down in the manner we expect.  
So if we don’ t do anything to remov e policy accommodation, and the labor m arket 
tightens and just continues to tighten , as you mentioned, arguably —we could, you know —
arguably , financial conditions overall haven’ t tightened that much .  We think the economy could 
overheat, inflation could rise more quickly and above our objective .  That’s something that 
would occur with a  lag, and that would force us later on to tighten pol icy more rapidly than 
would be ideal, and we could risk a recession if we did that. 
So there are risks on both sides to our objectives, and most of my colleagues and I have 
conclu ded that a gradual path of rate increases —while constantly watching incoming data, being 
open to revising our views on the outlook, and revising our expectations about policy —is the 
best way to manage that set of risks.

 Transcript of Chair Yellen’s Press Conference 
December 13, 2017 
 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Good afternoon.  Today the Federal Open Market Committee decide d 
to raise the target range for  the federal funds rate by ¼ perce ntage point, bringing it to 1¼ to 
1½ percent.  Our decision reflect s our assessment that a gradua l removal of monetary policy 
accommodation will sustain a strong labor market while fosterin g a return of inflation to 
2 percent, consistent with the maximum employment and price sta bility objectives assigned to us 
by law.  Before saying more about our decision, I’ll review rec ent economic developments and 
the outlook. 
Following a slowdown in the first qu arter, economic growth step ped up to a solid 
3¼ percent pace in the second and third quarters of the year.  Household spending has been 
expanding at a moderate rate, bus iness investment has picked up , and favorable economic 
conditions abroad have supported e xports.  Overall, we continue  to expect that the economy will 
expand at a moderate pace.  While changes in tax policy will li kely provide some lift to 
economic activity in coming years, the magnitude and timing of the macroeconomic effects of 
any tax package remain uncertain. 
Smoothing through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains ave raged 170,000 per month 
over the three months ending in N ovember, well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb 
new entrants to the labor force.  The unemployment rate has dec lined further in recent months 
and, at 4.1 percent in November, w as modestly below the median of FOMC participants’ 
estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Broader measures of labor market utilization have also 
continued to strengthen.  Parti cipation in the labor force has changed little, on net, over the past 
four years.  Given the underlyi ng downward tren d in participati on stemming largely from the 
aging of the U.S. population, a rel atively steady participation  rate is a further sign of improved

Page 2 of 27 
 conditions in the labor market.  We expect that the job market will remain strong in the years 
ahead. 
You may have noticed that we alter ed the statement language abo ut the labor market 
outlook.  This change highlights th at the Committee expects the  labor market to remain strong, 
with sustained job creation, amp le opportunities for workers, a nd rising wages.  We anticipate 
some further strengthening in labor market conditions in the mo nths ahead; however, we expect 
the pace of job gains to moderate  over time as we gradually red uce the degree of monetary 
policy accommodation.  Allowing the l abor market to overheat wo uld raise the risk that 
monetary policy would need to tight en abruptly at a later stage , jeopardizing the economic 
expansion. 
Even with a firming of economic growth and a stronger labor mar ket, inflation has 
continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objectiv e.  The 12-month change in the 
price index for personal consum ption expenditures was 1.6 perce nt in October, up a bit from the 
summer but still below rates se en earlier in the year.  Core in flation—which excludes the volatile 
food and energy categories—has fo llowed a similar pattern and w as 1.4 percent in October.  We 
continue to believe that this ye ar’s surprising softness in inf lation primarily refle cts transitory 
developments that are largel y unrelated to broader economic con ditions.  As a result, we still 
expect inflation will move up and stabilize around 2 percent ov er the next couple of years.  
Nonetheless, as I’ve noted pr eviously, our understanding of the  forces driving inflation is 
imperfect.  As emphasized in our sta tement, we will carefully m onitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to our symmetric inflation goal .  And, as I’ve noted before, we 
are prepared to adjust monetar y policy as needed to achieve our  inflation and employment 
objectives over the medium term. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 3 of 27 
 Let me turn to the economic proj ections that Committee particip ants submitted for this 
meeting.  As always, participants conditioned their projections  on their own individual views of 
appropriate monetary policy, which, in turn, depend on each par ticipant’s assessment of the 
many factors that shape the out look.  The median projection for  growth of inflation-adjusted 
gross domestic product, or real  GDP, is 2½ percent this year an d next and moderates to 2 percent 
by 2020, a bit above its estimated longer-run rate.  The median  projection for the unemployment 
rate stands at 4.1 percent in the  fourth quarter of this year a nd runs close to 4 percent over the 
next three years, modestly below the median estimate of its lon ger-run normal rate.  Finally, the 
median inflation projection i s 1.7 percent this year, 1.9 perce nt next year, and 2 percent in 2019 
and 2020.  Compared with the projections made in September, rea l GDP growth is a little 
stronger, the unemployment rate i s a bit lower, a nd inflation i s essentially unchanged.  
Participants generally identif ied changes in tax policy as a fa ctor supporting this modestly 
stronger outlook, although many note d that much uncertainty rem ains about the macroeconomic 
effects of the specific measures that ultimately may be impleme nted. 
Returning to monetar y policy, for the past two years the FOMC h as been gradually 
increasing its target range for  the federal funds rate as the e conomy has continued to make 
progress toward our goals of maxim um employment and price stabi lity.  Our decision today 
continues this process. 
We still expect that the ongoing s trength of the economy will w arrant gradual increases in 
the federal funds rate.  That expectation is based on our view that this rate remains somewhat 
below its neutral level—that is , the level that is neither expa nsionary nor contractionary and 
keeps the economy operating on an even keel.  Because the neutr al rate currently appears to be 
quite low by historical standards , the federal funds rate would  not have to rise much further to 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 4 of 27 
 get to a neutral policy stance.  But because we also expect the  neutral level of the federal funds 
rate to rise somewhat over time, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the 
next few years to sustain a str ong labor market and stabilize i nflation around our 2 percent 
longer-run objective.  Even so, the Committee continues to anti cipate that the longer-run neutral 
level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain below level s that prevailed in previous decades. 
This view is consistent with par ticipants’ projections of appro priate monetary policy.  
The median projection for the  federal funds rate is 2.1 percent  at the end of ne xt year, 2.7 percent 
at the end of 2019, and 3.1 percent in 2020.  Compared with the  projections made in September, 
the median path for the feder al funds rate is unchanged through  2019 and a touch higher in 2020. 
I should note that the economic  outlook is highly uncertain, an d participants will adjust 
their assessments of the appropr iate path for the federal funds  rate as their economic outlooks 
and views of the risks to the  outlook change.  Policy is not on  a preset course. 
Additionally, the Committee’s ba lance sheet norm alization progr am, initiated in October, 
is proceeding.  As we’ve noted pr eviously, changing the target range for the feder al funds rate is 
our primary means of adjusting the  stance of monetary policy, a nd we do not foresee a need to 
alter our balance sheet norma lization program.  Hence, our stat ement no longer mentions this 
program.  Of course, we would be pr epared to resume reinvestmen ts if a material deterioration in 
the economic outlook were to warra nt a sizable reduction in the  federal funds rate. 
Finally, I’d like to note that , although I have one more FOMC m eeting to attend in the 
New Year, this will be my last scheduled news conference.  Over  the next month and a half, I 
will do my utmost to ensure a sm ooth transition to my designate d successor, Jay Powell.  I am 
confident that he is as deeply committed as I have been to the Federal Reserve’s vital public

 mission.  Thank you for being such an a ttentive audi ence these past four years.  And, as always, 
I’ll be happy to take your questions. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  I’m Marty C rutsinger, Associated Press.  Ma dam Chair, 
could you give us any insight int o the discussion and how it de alt with the major tax changes that 
Congress is considering now?  T here have been thoughts that wit h these changes happening at a 
time when the economy is already—with unemployment so low—that the Fed may be forced to 
increase its pace on rate hikes .  Did any of that discussion co me up in your meeting? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, yes, we did di scuss tax policy, and let me s ay that most of my 
colleagues factored in the prospe ct of fiscal stimulus along th e lines of what’s being 
contemplated by Congress into the ir projections.  Now, I should  emphasize that some have been 
incorporating those expectations  into their projections through out the year, so changes to the 
projections that you see since Se ptember should not be viewed a s an impact—an estimate of the 
impact of the tax package.  And, i n particular, broader expecta tions of changes to fiscal policy 
have been reflected in financi al market conditions, I think, ov er the past year.  For example, we 
have seen a significant increase in the stock market, and at le ast some portion of that, I would 
judge, likely partly reflected e xpected tax changes, and that e ffect—along with other financial 
market effects, which affects, f or example, projected consumer spending and would have 
affected wealth—that’s been part  of participants’ forecasts now  for some time.  I think my 
colleagues and I are in line wit h the general expectation among  most economists that the type of 
tax changes that are likely t o be enacted would tend to provide  some modest lift to GDP growth 
in the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of th e reasons, I think, for the uptick 
you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rat e. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 6 of 27 
 The views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a w ide range of analysis, 
including that of the Joint Committee on Taxation and other out side evaluators, and my sense is 
that their estimates are essentially in the same ballpark, alth ough they recognize, as I 
emphasized, that there is consid erable uncertainty about the im pacts, and that will have to be 
monitored over time.  More spec ifically, they t end to see the p ackage as boosting both consumer 
spending and capital spending, to some extent. 
Now, to the extent that the c hanges do have positive impact on the growth of potential 
GDP and longer-run growth, let me just say that this is somethi ng that, should it occur, would be 
very welcome to participants, as long as it’s consistent with t he attainment of our employment 
and inflation objectives.  I gue ss I would also urge you to rem ember that when you look at the 
projections, that there are ma ny factors that affect those proj ections, and changes in tax policy—
that’s only one of a number of f actors, including incoming data  that has, to some extent, altered 
the outlook for growth and infla tion.  All of tha t factors into  the projections you see. 
But I think, bottom line, whe n you look at assessments of the f unds rate path, participants 
continue to see gradual increases  in the target r ange for the f ederal funds rate as being 
appropriate to sustain a strong l abor market and bring inflatio n back to 2 percent.  And, look—
importantly, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likel y effects will be, and my colleagues 
and I will be committed, as alwa ys, to evaluating incoming data  and altering the outlook as 
appropriate. 
HARRIET TORRY.  Harriet  Torry with Dow Jones Newswires.  You an d others at the 
Fed have said that soft infla tion should be transitory.  Are yo u confident that tha t will still be the 
case, particularly regarding wag e gains?  They’ve been pretty m oderate in recent months, yet the 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 7 of 27 
 economy is growing and confiden ce is high.  Is there something going on in the economy that’s 
making it difficult for businesses to raise wages? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So it is true that i ncoming wage data suggests o nly modest upward 
pressure on wages.  That leaves  me—that’s one factor, along wit h the fact that inflation remains 
low—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemplo yment rate, that the labor 
market is not overheated at thi s point.  Remember, the modest p ace of wage gains also probably 
reflects slow productivity growth.  But when you ask me about t he outlook for  inflation, you 
know, I’ve talked in detail abou t this in the past and recogniz e that there is uncertainty about 
what’s holding inflation down.  But  my colleagues and I continu e to believe that th e factors that 
are responsible this year for hol ding inflation down are likely  to prove transitory.  That said, we 
all agree that our inf lation objective is extremely important.  We recognize that there’s been a 
prolonged shortfall.  This is a s ymmetric 2 percent inflation o bjective, and we continue to 
indicate that we’ll be monitori ng inflation developments closel y.  And so this is on the horizon 
and recognized to be one of  the risks facing policy. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Yellen, I 
wanted to follow up on the questi on about tax changes.  When yo u addressed it earlier today, and 
when you spoke to Congress last  month, you often describe that you would welcome higher 
growth in the context of the emp loyment and inflation mandate.  And I guess I wonder how you 
judge the major provisions of t he House and Senate tax plans:  the corporate rate cut, immediate 
expensing of big-ticket purchases , new rates for pass-throughs,  temporary rate cuts for 
individuals.  Do you see thos e, on balance, boosting the produc tive capacity of the U.S. economy 
as opposed to simply increasing aggregate demand?  And, related  to that, how would you view 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 8 of 27 
 the benefit of such tax changes  now, when the economy is nearin g full employment, versus at 
earlier periods when there was greater resource slack? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the li kely tax package as 
boosting aggregate demand, but als o having some potential to bo ost aggregate supply.  So 
changes on the corporate tax sid e—the reduction in the corporat e tax rate, expensing—will lower 
the cost of capital.  And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how much 
stimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would se e some stimulus to investment. 
In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of invest ment could boost capital 
formation and thereby raise produ ctivity growth and potential G DP or output to some extent.  
Exactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain, but that is a channel.  And I suppose 
it’s also possible—I’m uncertain ho w significant this would be— that lower marginal effective 
tax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor  supply.  And, again, there are a 
range of estimates in the literatures. 
I indicated I think participants  have reviewed a number of piec es of analysis, including 
the Joint Committee on Taxati on estimates, and the many outside  analysts who have weighed in 
on this and been influenced by tha t kind of analysis—but there is a good deal of uncertainty 
about what the impacts would be.  And, to the extent that there  are larger impacts than those 
analyses assume on aggregate s upply or potential GDP, in the co ntext of an economy that has 
had disturbingly low productivit y growth, that would be welcome  and could support faster GDP 
growth, at least for some  period, without—you know, without cre ating a need to tighten 
monetary policy to offset that. 
So there are potentially bot h demand and supply effects here.  So, importantly, you really 
don’t, at the end of the day, see  very much change in the feder al funds rate path.  Participants do 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 9 of 27 
 recognize that the unemployment ra te is lower than their estima tes of its long-run sustainable 
rate, so I think we ar e in the vicinity of full employment. 
HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.   You have mentioned that 
the Committee thinks there will be wage increases next year.  I ’m wondering if you could clarify 
if that is coming in part or mostl y from the changes to the tax  plan.  Is that what the expectation 
is, would drive the wage increas es?  And I was also wondering, I’ve heard from so many female 
economists in academia and at the Fed about what an inspiration  you’ve been to them and how 
melancholy they will be to s ee you go.  I was wondering if you just had any final words to young 
females and minorities who may be looking to enter economics or  a banking profession and rise 
to your level. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I’m sorry, remind me of the first part of your q uestion.  [Laughter] 
HEATHER LONG.  Wages. CHAIR YELLEN.  Wages, yes. 
HEATHER LONG.  Is the tax policy dr iving wage increase expectat ions? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think, gene rally, in a strong labor mark et where many firms 
are having difficulty finding quali fied workers, we would expec t, just through normal demand 
and supply channels, to see some  upward pressure on wage growth  over time.  And as the labor 
market is tightened, we’ve seen s ome very gradual drift upward in wage gains.  They remain—it 
remains at a low level, but I w ould expect, in the context of a n ongoing strong labor market, to 
see some upward pressure.  And I be lieve that’s the main thing that my colleagues are 
factoring in. 
On your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Fede ral Reserve, my 
colleagues and I are very fo cused on wanting to see and do what  we can to foster greater 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 10 of 27 
 participation of women and minor ities in economics.  We would l ove to, if we could, increase 
our hiring ourselves of women and minorities, and we see that b oth women and minorities are 
studying economics in disproportiona tely and disturbingly low n umbers.  Although the women 
in STEM fields generally are abou t even with men—represent abou t 50 percent—in economics, 
women majors constitute somet hing like 30 percent of undergradu ate majors, and there is 
disproportionate low enrollment of minorities. 
I will just say, from my own experience, I think economics is a  terrific field.  I’ve 
thoroughly enjoyed my career in economics and think there are m any different paths that people 
can follow that lead to satisfyi ng careers, and that there are very interesting and important 
questions that economics addresse s.  And it is a great field, a nd I would like to encourage greater 
involvement and think that peopl e will find that satisfying.  A nd, just in terms of the kinds of 
research that’s done in the fi eld, I think also a greater diver sity, more women and minorities, 
may change the focus to some ext ent of the questions that peopl e choose to look at and the 
analysis that they bring and a r ange of thinking that bears on research.  And all of that would be a 
healthy development. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, C NBC.  Every day, it seems, we l ook at the stock 
market, it goes up triple digits  in the Dow Jones.  To what ext ent are there concerns at the 
Federal Reserve about current  market valuations, and do they no w or should they, do you think, 
if we keep going on this trajectory— should that animate monetar y policy?  Finally, maybe as a 
sign of what’s been going on with va luations, this cryptocurren cy called bitcoin keeps going up 
every day.  What is the policy of t he central bank of the Unite d States of the introduction, use, 
and incredible rise i n popularity of bitcoin? 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 11 of 27 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So let me star t, Steve, with the stock ma rket generally.  I 
mean, of course the stock mar ket has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recent 
months characterized the general level of asset valuations as “ elevated.”  What that reflects is 
simply the assessment that, looki ng at price/earnings ratios an d comparable metrics for other 
assets other than equities, we s ee ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges—and so that’s 
worth pointing out.  But economists  are not great at knowing wh at appropriate valuations are.  
We don’t have a terrific record, and the fact that those valuat ions are high doesn’t mean that they 
are necessarily overvalued. 
We are in a—I’ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we ’ve talked about this 
repeatedly—likely a low interes t rate environment, lower than w e’ve had in past decades.  And if 
that turns out to be the case, t hat’s a factor that supports hi gher valuations.  We’re enjoying solid 
economic growth with low inflati on, and the risks in the global  economy look more balanced 
than they have in many years .  So I think what we need to and a re trying to think through is, if 
there were an adjustment in ass et valuations or the stock marke t, what impact would that have on 
the economy, and would it provoke fi nancial stability concerns?   And I think when we look at 
other indicators of financial s tability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there or possibly even 
orange.  We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system , and we’re not seeing some 
worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive le vels.1  So, you know, this is 
something that the FOMC pays  attention to, but if you ask me, i s this a significant factor shaping 
monetary policy now, we ll, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor. 
And then you asked about bitcoin, a nd there I would simply say that bitcoin at this time 
plays a very small role in the payment system.  It is not a sta ble source of—store of value, and it 
                                                 
1 Chair Yellen intended to say that credit growth is not at excessive  levels. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 12 of 27 
 doesn’t constitute legal tender.  It is a highly speculative as set, and the Fed doesn’t really play 
any role—any regulatory role wi th respect to bitcoin other than  assuring that banking 
organizations that we do supervis e are attentive, that they’re appropriately  managing any 
interactions they have with partic ipants in that market and app ropriately monitoring anti-money-
laundering Bank Secrecy Act, you know, r esponsibilities that th ey have. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Has there been a  directive, or, more importantl y, has there been a 
directive about bitcoin to the ba nks and their dealings with bi tcoin from the Federal Reserve? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  I don’t believe the re’s been anything specific a bout that, just, 
generally, banks have Bank Secrecy  Act anti-money-laundering re sponsibilities, and this applies 
to bitcoin as it does i n every other realm. 
DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chair Yelle n, Donna Borak with CNN.  To retur n back to the 
prospective tax bill questions, in y our view at all, is the Rep ublican tax bill an ill-timed fiscal 
stimulus, and are you concerned at all it will wind up squander ing the tools both the Congress 
and the Fed have when it comes time to dealing with a recession ? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, look, I will just  say that it is up to the A dministration and 
Congress to decide on appropr iate fiscal policy, and our job is  to maintain our focus on 
employment and inflation.  We c ontinue to think, as you can see  from the projections, that a 
gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with al most all participants now 
factoring in their assessment of  the impact of the tax—the tax policy. 
You know, it is projected that the tax cut package will lead to  additions to the national 
debt and boost, by the end of the hor izon, the debt-to-GDP rati o.  And I will say—and this is 
nothing new, this is something I’v e been saying for a long time —I am personally concerned 
about the U.S. debt situation.  It’ s not that the debt-to-GDP r atio at the moment is extraordinarily 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 13 of 27 
 or worrisomely high, but it’s als o not very low.  And it’s proj ected, as the population continues 
to age and the baby boomers retire, that that ratio will contin ue to rise in an unsustainable 
fashion.  So the addition to the  debt, taking what is already a  significant problem and making it 
worse, is—it is of concern to me , and I think it does suggest t hat in some future downturn, 
which, well, could occur just for  whatever reason, the amount o f fiscal space that would exist for 
fiscal policy to play an active role, it will be limited—may we ll be limited. 
SAM FLEMING.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  A couple of longer-term 
questions.  First of all, midwa y through the year you talked ab out the issue of whether inflation 
targets might need to be raise d.  There’s obviously been a lot more debate in the Fed’s system 
since then about this.  It ma y not be an imminent issue, but do  you expect it to be something the 
Fed should be discussing over the coming years as some sort of change to the inflation target?  
Second of all, the amount of stimul us tools that the Fed may ha ve at its disposal when the next 
downturn strikes are fairly limited.  One of the incoming gover nors, Marvin Goodfriend, has 
talked about the merits of negativ e interest rates.  I just won dered whether you see that as a 
potential—or at least in theory, f or the Fed to consider should  it run out of other options.  
Thanks. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So right now the F OMC is not discussing or consi dering its inflation 
target.  We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over  the next couple of years, and I 
would say—you said our stimulus too ls are limited.  I would wan t to emphasize that if there were 
a negative shock to the econom y, we do have some scope to cut t he fed funds rate, and there are 
other tools available, ones that  we have used previously:  forw ard guidance and asset purchases.  
So I think we’re not—I wouldn’t say that we’re out of ammunitio n, but certainly it’s been 
recognized—and I’ve emphasized mys elf that, in the longer run, we may be—and we’ll have to 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 14 of 27 
 see how this works out, but we ma y be in low interest rate envi ronments where it could prove 
useful to have additional scope  to conduct monetary policy.  An d, in that context, I think 
additional research—the academic economists and others are thin king hard about what more 
could be done, and I think these are  matters that are certainly  worthy of further study. 
SAM FLEMING.  So you do believe tha t negative interest rates, a t least in theory, are 
possible in the U.S. at some point if it should be necessary—at  least in theory. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, I mean, on that I would say we have—that’s n ot something that 
we have studied inside the Fed t o any considerable extent and h aven’t seriously thought about 
using ourselves during this las t downturn and recovery.  We hav e watched what’s happened in 
other countries.  I think that ’s worthwhile.  And I would say i t’s an area that academics may have 
interest in in the future and i s worthy of some study, but it h asn’t been part of  the Fed’s agenda. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, C hair Yellen.  Victoria Guida with Politic o.  I just wanted to 
ask you quickly, on the regulator y side, in your testimony to C ongress recently you spoke 
positively about the Senate bank re gulatory reform bill, and I was wondering if there are—
beyond that bill—if there are tweaks to Dodd-Frank that you thi nk might still be beneficial.  And 
then, somewhat related, Governor  Powell recently said that ther e are currently no U.S. banks that 
are too big to fail.  And I w as wondering, do you agree with th at assessment? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I mea n, you know, I think I’m not familiar  with every detail of 
the bill, but I think the bill does address a wide range of iss ues that, you know, we’ve highlighted 
in the past as being ones where pe rhaps additiona l flexibility to tailor our supervisory 
requirements would be worthwhile.  So I don’t have additional t hings on the congressional list.  
Sorry, and what—the other thing— 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  T oo big to fail. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 15 of 27 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, too big to fail. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Are there any banks that are too big to fail r ight now? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, you know, we con tinue to work seriously on r esolution and the 
resolution plans, the living wills, and the structure of system ic firms to ensure that it would be 
possible to resolve a firm—unde r the bankruptcy code would be t he top choice of methods, or, 
alternatively, under the Orde rly Liquidation Authority.  And I think it’s fair to say that, over 
time, we have learned more ourselves and more clearly detailed our expectations for the firms 
that file living wills.  And the firms themselves have made con siderable progress in, you know, 
changing what they do, whether it ’s adopting financial contract s that would facilitate a resolution 
rather than a disorderly unwi nding of contracts, making sure th at they’re appropr iately dealing 
with shared services so that ke y services would be able to cont inue, governance arrangements, 
legal entity structures—the fi rms have all made progress in ada pting to our expectations of what 
would enable a successful res olution.  So I think it’s an ongoi ng process, and I believe we have 
made substantial progress. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times .  I’m struggling to 
reconcile the pieces of the economic outlook that you’ve descri bed today.  You’ve said that we 
are basically at full employme nt.  You’ve said that you’re expe cting a tax package to deliver a 
significant stimulus, and that it will be on the demand side.  You expect growth to be faster.  You 
expect unemployment to be lower , and yet somehow inflation is g oing to remain at 2 percent for 
the foreseeable future.  Coul d you describe what has changed ab out your economic assessment 
so that everything has cha nged except inflation? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you know, the proj ections that we’re showi ng you today, many 
factors went into that, fis cal policy being one of a number of different factors.  And, you know, 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 16 of 27 
 you’re looking at 16 participants w ho have made adjustments to their economic outlook for a 
whole variety of reasons, includ ing, in some cases, rethinking some of the fundamentals that 
went into their original forecast.  So there have been modifica tions in different directions by 
different participants.   So I  would caution you about the dang ers of looking at the median and 
acting like that is on e individual who has made a change to the ir forecast.  That’s a leap that isn’t 
quite justified. 
But, look, generally, you see modes tly faster growth over the n ext couple of years, which 
is consistent and, I said, I thi nk for most participants, refle cts partly an impact from taxes 
stimulating consumer and investment spending.  But it’s not a g igantic increase in growth that 
since—relative to September. 
You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inf lation has also been 
running low on a persistent basis,  and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and 
wants to see it moving up.  And, on balance, you see only modes t changes, slight revisions to the 
path for the fed funds rate .  You might think, well, shouldn’t I see more?  Well, okay, growth is a 
little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower— that would perhaps push in the 
direction of slightly tighter  monetary policy.  But, again, cou nterbalancing that is that inflation 
has run lower than we expect , and, you know, it could take a lo nger period of a very strong labor 
market in order to achieve  the inflation objective. 
JUSTINE UNDERHILL.  Justine Un derhill, Yahoo Finance.  So Willi am Dudley of the 
New York Fed recently said that th e Fed is exploring the idea o f potentially having its own 
cryptocurrency or digital cu rrency.  What use do you see a cryp tocurrency could have for the 
Fed, and do you see the potential of a  cryptocurrency that migh t be considered legal tender? 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 17 of 27 
 CHAIR YELLEN.  So I want to disti nguish carefully between digit al currency and 
cryptocurrency.  This is—there  is a discussion going on among c entral bankers about the 
potential merits of adopting—a central bank itself adopting a d igital currency.  And there might 
even be a central banker or tw o around the globe that might go in that direction.  But I really 
want to caution that this is not s omething the Federal Reserve is seriously considering at this 
stage while we’re looking at re search on this to pic.  There are , I think, to my mind, limited 
benefits from introducing it, a  limited need for it, and some s ubstantial concerns.  And so I would 
really doubt that the Federal Reserve would soon go in that dir ection.  But it is something that 
central banks are looking at to s ee if there could be benefits from doing it. 
CRAIG TORRES.  Chair Yellen, before I ask this question, thanks  for your stewardship 
of the economy, the benefits of w hich I’ve seen in some of the harder-hit parts of my own 
family, so— 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you. 
CRAIG TORRES.  Your tenure.  We’ ve seen six Federal Reserve pre sidents appointed.  
One was a woman and five are m en, so I’d like to know how that comports with your 
commitment to gender diversity.  And, second, I wonder if you t hink this process of appointing 
Reserve Bank presidents needs t o be more transparent and accoun table.  Recently, the Richmond 
Fed board took 11 months, and they c ame up with a candidate who  was another Fed board 
member.  And so I’m wondering wha t you would say to critics who  say that looks like cronyism, 
and if you think, you know, this coul d be simply a more open pr ocess.  These are votes on 
national monetary policy, after all. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would agree w ith you that these are importa nt appointments.  
Under the Federal Reserve Act , the nonbanking directors of the Reserve Banks have 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 18 of 27 
 responsibility for conducting a s earch, and the Board of Govern ors has to sign off on the 
candidates.  We’ve made very c lear and we monitor ongoing searc hes very carefully to make 
sure that absolutely every effo rt is made to create a pool that  is diverse, and t hat there be a 
national search, and that every a ttempt should be made to creat e a diverse pool.  At the end of the 
day, we cannot guarantee that the  outcomes of these searches wi ll result in an increase in 
diversity.  I mean, I’ve been ver y pleased to see that there’s been some success in that regard, but 
we have signed off on the indivi duals who were appointed and ha ve held the view that these are 
individuals who were qualified to serve in these positions.  So  I would hope—I would hope to 
see greater diversity.  It has b een a challenge to achieve that . 
CRAIG TORRES.  Should the pro cess be more open somehow? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think the pr ocess has become more open, and in a number of 
the recent searches there has been outreach—public outreach, in formation on websites, 
acceptance of potential names and nominees, and those have gott en careful consideration.  There 
has been—there have been meetings in some cases with community groups to try to enlarge the 
pool and get suggestions, and I thi nk that’s appropriate, and I  think it has move d in the direction 
you’re suggesting. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.   I’m 
wondering if you have any advice for incoming Chair Powell? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, my colleague —I’ve had the pleasure of work ing with him now 
for many years, and he is somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and shares 
its values.  And as I mentione d in my opening statement, he is committed to the mission of the 
Fed; to its independence; and t o its acting in a nonpartisan, n onpolitical way.  He is somebody 
who has participated in the FOMC  now for many years.  To the be st of my knowledge, he has 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 19 of 27 
 been part of the consensus.  I don’ t believe he’s ever dissente d.  I think there is strong consensus 
in the Committee for the gradua l approach that we have been pur suing, and Governor Powell has 
been part of that consensus, so I  feel he’s very well positione d and very knowledgeable of all the 
ins and outs of everything tha t the Fed does.  In supervision, in the payment system—he’s played 
an active role there—and in m onetary policy, and I have confide nce that he is very capable of 
steering the Federal Reser ve in the years ahead. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Do you mean me, or—as long as everyone gets a tu rn.  This is John 
Heltman with the American Banker.   Sort of a related question to w hat Nancy was asking—there 
have been some reservations among some Democratic senators rece ntly during Governor 
Powell’s confirmation hearing a nd during the markup of the reg relief bill about the approach 
towards regulation that the new leadership appears to be adopti ng.  Do you have any similar 
reservations about the new leader ship’s ability t o deregulate i n an evenhanded way that keeps an 
eye towards the stability of the financial system and the—sort of, the advances that have come 
from post-crisis regulation? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I would say that all of my colleagues on the Board have expressed 
a strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have  produced a stronger financial 
system.  And I’m considering th ere stronger capital, particular ly for the most systemic 
institutions—higher-quality capit al, stronger liquidity require ments, a rigorous stress-testing 
program, and resolution planning that will make it more possibl e to resolve a firm that 
encounters signifi cant distress. 
So I have heard broad-based commitm ent to those things, and I t hink they are the core of 
the reforms we have put in plac e.  I think all of us agree that  it is appropriate t o tailor regulatory 
requirements in all of those are as and others to the systemic f ootprint of firms.  We have done a 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 20 of 27 
 lot to do that, and I think ther e is more that could be done, a nd in some areas it would require 
legislation in order to do that .  But I believe all of my colle agues and I are in agreement on that, 
and we’re also focused on commun ity banks and want to find ways  to relieve burdens.  So in 
those important ways, I do think t hat all of my colleagues are in the same place with respect to 
their priorities. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Are there any important differences between your  colleagues and 
your vision on regulatory reform? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So I have not seen a nything emerge at this point  that I would describe 
as a significant difference. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard S chneider with Reuters.  So you m entioned in 
response to Steve’s question t hat asset valuations, you didn’t think, were on the sort of high-
priority risk list right no w.  So I’m wondering, what do you th ink is on that risk list?  And, more 
broadly, what have you left undone ?  You’ve gotten high marks f or bringing the economy back 
towards its goals, but are the re things that are going to nag y ou when you walk out of here in 
February and say, “Really, I wis h I’d seen this to completion”?   I mean, we’re not doing negative 
interest rates.  We’re not doing i nflation framework.  What’s a t your top of—what’s at the top of 
the to-do list that you are not  getting to see to bring to grou nd here? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So you asked about t he risk list.  There are alw ays risks that affect the 
outlook.  We tend to focus in our ow n evaluation on economic ri sks, and we’ve characterized 
them as “balanced.”  And I t hink they are balanced.  You know, I can always give you a list of, 
you know, potential troubles, interna tional developments that c ould result in downside economic 
risk.  But, look, at the moment t he U.S. economy is performing well.  The growth that we’re 
seeing, it’s not based on, for ex ample, an unsustainable buildu p of debt as we had in the run-up 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 21 of 27 
 to the financial crisis.  The  global economy is doing well.  We ’re in a synchronized expansion.  
This is the first time in many y ears that we’ve  seen this.  Inf lation around the world is generally 
low.  So I think the risks are ba lanced, and there’s less to lo se sleep about now t han has been true 
for quite some time, so I feel  good about the economic out—the economic outlook. 
I feel, you know, good that th e labor market is in a very much stronger place than it was 
eight years ago.  We have created 17 million jobs.  We’ve got a  good, strong labor market and a 
very low unemployment rate, and I  think that’s been tremendousl y important to the well-being of 
American households and workers .  And I feel very pleased when I hear anecdotes from firms 
that tell me they’re having a  hard time finding workers, and th ey talk about, given that they’re 
taking on people with skills that don’t quite match what they w ant, but they’re training them, 
and, you know, giving them the traini ng that they need in order  to be able to fill jobs.  I think 
that’s a development that is a  natural one that occurs in a str ong labor market that tends to build 
human capital and worker skills , and that that’s a strong posit ive. 
As I mentioned, I think the finan cial system is on much sounder  footing, and that we have 
done a great deal to put in place gr eater capital, liquidity, a nd so forth that ma ke it less crisis 
prone, and that has been a n important objective. 
What’s on my “undone” list, you ask?  We have a 2 percent symme tric inflation 
objective, and, for a number of  years now, inflation has been r unning under 2 percent.  And I 
consider it an important prior ity to make sure that inflation d oesn’t chronically undershoot our 
2 percent objective, and I wa nt to see it move up to 2 percent.   So most of my colleagues and I do 
believe that it’s being held dow n by transitory factors, but th ere’s work undone there, in the 
sense—we need to see it move  up in line with ou r objective. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 22 of 27 
 GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Chair Y ellen, what do you think will be  the drivers of 
inflation over the next couple of years, and how long will the Committee go with low 
unemployment, low inflation befo re you rethink monetary policy— this gradual rate hikes?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, you know, I think f or a number of years—so w e’ve had an 
undershoot of inflation for a numbe r of years.  We absolutely r ecognize that.  I think until this 
year, undershoot was understandab le.  First we had a good deal of slack in the labor market.  
Then we had plummeting oil pr ices.  And, beginning in mid-2014,  there was a marked 
depreciation in the dollar.2  And those three factors hel d down inflation for a number of y ears.   
Now, in 2016, core inflation came  very close to 2 percent.  We seemed to be on a path of 
inflation moving up, and this ye ar, beginning in March, there s eemed to be a sequence of 
negative surprises.  Some reflec t one-time factors that were ea sily identifiable, like a marked 
decline in quality-adjusted cel l phone plans.  There may be oth er factors that are not so easy to 
name, but we would judge—you know, inf lation doesn’t always fol low exactly.  There are errors 
and many factors that affect i t beyond the key influences of la bor market slack:  exchange rates 
and import prices and oil prices .  Those are three big ones.  B ut there are other factors that affect 
inflation too, and our judgment at  this point is that transitor y factors that are unrelated to the 
broader macroeconomic outl ook are holding inflation down. 
But I have tried to be straightfo rward in saying that this coul d end up being something 
that is more ingrained and tur ns out to be permanent.  It’s ver y important to watch it and, if 
necessary, rethink what’s determ ining inflation.  A possibility  is that the longer-run sustainable 
                                                 
2 Chair Yellen intended to say that, beginning in mid-2014, ther e was a marked appreciation  of the dollar. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 23 of 27 
 rate of unemployment is—it’s b een coming down.  Estimates in th e Committee have come down.  
It’s conceivable that they n eed to come down even more. 
It’s not my judgment that inflat ion expectations have slipped, but that also remains a 
possibility that needs to be monitored.  So there are—you know,  there could be a rethink of 
inflation.  I think it’s importa nt to watch inflation outcomes carefully and, if we don’t see 
inflation moving in the manner that  the Committee anticipates, to alter policy so that we do 
achieve our 2 percent ob jective.  But, at the moment, most of m y colleagues and I believe we are 
on track to achieve it. 
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Chair Ye llen.  Jim Puzzanghera with the Los Angeles Times.   
I’m wondering, you mentioned this i s your last news conference.   What are your plans when you 
step down from the Fed?  Are  you going to remain in Washington?   Will you go back to 
Berkeley?  And, also, I’m curi ous if you have any disappointmen t that you’re not going to be 
continuing in this job as some of your predecessors have done. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So, on my plans, I  don’t have anything definite for you, I guess.  I 
have a home in Berkeley and expect  to maintain it.  But I would  say, my spouse is on the 
faculty—he’s a professor at Geo rgetown and would like to stay i n his job, and we expect to 
maintain Washington as our base .  But I don’t have any definite  plans. 
Let’s see.  And you asked me if I’m disappointed.  So let me ju st say that I have served in 
senior positions in the Federal  Reserve now for quite a long ti me.  I became president in San 
Francisco in 2004, and I’ve particip ated in the FOMC since that  time as president, as Vice Chair, 
and as Chair, and it’s been an imm ensely rewarding experience f or me.  I feel very positive about 
what we’ve been able to accomplish and feel tremendous, you kno w, loyalty to the institution.  
So I did make the judgment that this is the right time for me t o leave, but I feel I have served in 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 24 of 27 
 senior positions at the Fed for  a long time, and it’s really be en an honor and a priv ilege for me to 
have had a chance to do so. 
ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro with Fox Business.  Glad to hear yo u’re staying on 
the East Coast.  I’m just curi ous, I wanted to follow up to the  bitcoin questions, but—because 
you’ve lived through what we a ll experienced in 2007, 2008, and —should the Fed take a more 
active role in trying to iden tify who some of the counterparty and what the exposure is with 
bitcoin as a potential threat to f inancial stability?  Just—the  best minds at the Fed can sometimes 
miss these kinds of threats.  Your predecessor, Mr. Bernanke, a ctually said in ’07 that the 
contagion from subprime would not  affect the housing market or the economy.  So are we 
underestimating the potential threat from bitcoin as it runs up  in value? 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I certainly a gree that it’s important for the Fed to attempt to 
understand emerging risks to finan cial stability and to be look ing not just in the banking system 
but outside it for developments t hat could pose financial risks , and we are doing that.  And, I 
would say, one of the changes durin g my tenure is, we devoted—d ecided in the aftermath of the 
crisis that we needed to devote considerable resources to finan cial stability to monitor for 
emerging threats, and now we have a t the Board a full-blown div ision of financial  stability that’s 
involved in doing that. 
Now, when you ask about bitcoin, I  still see the financial stab ility risks from it as limited.  
Often, risks threatening financial  stability arise when there’s  exposure of the banking system to 
fluctuating asset valuations, a nd I really don’t see any signif icant exposure of our core financial 
institutions to threats from b itcoin if its value were to fluct uate.  I don’t see a threat to our core 
financial institutions.  So, undoubtedly, there are individuals  who could lose a lot of money if 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 25 of 27 
 bitcoin were to fall in price , but I really don’t see that as c reating a full-blown financial 
stability risk. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee fr om Bloomberg Television and Rad io.  I suppose 
I should be asking you a valedictor y question since it’s the la st question, but I don’t think you 
can top what you’ve already said, s o let me just do a couple of  cleanup questions here.  President 
Trump, while you were speaking, jus t said that he thinks his ta x plan will produce 4 percent 
growth.  Do you think that is pos sible?  Second, do you think t hat there is any Fed blame or 
complicity in the flattening of  the yield curve, and are you wo rried that there might be some sort 
of policy mistake built into that that could slow the economy?  And the last question, which is a 
bit of a valedictory, is one that everybody on Wall Street has wanted to ask you for four years.  
Since this is your last press conference, can you tell us which  dot is yours?  [Laughter] 
CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I can answer the last question first.  The  answer is “no.”  I’ve 
never been willing to reveal which dot is mine, and I’m not goi ng to change that now. 
So, you know, my assessment, and I think most participants’ ass essments, as I said, of the 
impact of the tax policy on grow th has been informed by work by  the Joint Committee on 
Taxation and other analysts.  A nd everyone recognizes that ther e’s uncertainty about what the 
economic effects would be, and I w ouldn’t want to rule anything  out.  It is challenging, however, 
to achieve growth of the level s that you mentioned.  Look, if t he package were to stimulate 
growth of that magnitude, let me just say again, the Federal Re serve would welcome that.  If it’s 
a supply-side—favorable supply-si de developments that would be compatible with the 
attainment of our employment a nd inflation objectives, that’s s omething that would be very, very 
welcome.  But it would be challe nging to achieve numbers like t hat. 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 26 of 27 
 Let’s see, I think you also then ask ed me about the yield curve , and—I mean, there is 
much discussion about yield curve  inversions and whether or not  a flattening yield curve could 
signal a recession.  Is that t he brunt of your question? 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  And whether the F ed has made—if there’s a polic y mistake 
embedded in that. 
CHAIR YELLEN.  So this is somethi ng that we discussed and have looked at.  The yield 
curve has flattened some as we  have raised short rates.  It mai nly—the flattening yield curve 
mainly reflects higher short-t erm rates.  The yield curve is no t currently inverted, and I would 
say that the current slope is we ll within its historical range.  
Now, there is a strong correla tion historically between yield c urve inversions and 
recessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causat ion, and I think that there are good 
reasons to think that the relati onship between the slope of the  yield curve and the business cycle 
may have changed.  And one reason for that is that long-term in terest rates generally embody 
two factors.  One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second 
piece of it is a so-ca lled term premium that often reflects thi ngs like inflation—inflation risk. 
Typically, the term premium historically has been positive.  So  when the yield curve has 
inverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well  above average expected short rates 
over the longer run.  So with the positive term premium, that’s  what it means.  And typically that 
means that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite rest rictive, and some of those 
recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tig htening monetary policy because 
inflation was high and trying to slow the economy. 
Well, right now the term premiu m is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and that 
means that, structurally—and thi s can be true going forward—tha t the yield curve is likely to be 
December 13, 2017 Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 
 
Page 27 of 27 
 flatter than it’s been in the pa st.  And so it could more easil y invert.  If the Fed were to even 
move to a slightly restrictiv e policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero term premium. 
So I think the fact the term pr emium is so low and the yield cu rve is generally flatter is an 
important factor to consider.  Now , I think it’s also important  to realize that mar ket participants 
are not expressing heightened conc ern about the decline of the term premium, and, when asked 
directly about the odds of recession, they see it as low, and I  would concur with that judgment. 
Thanks very much.

Page 1 of 22 Transcript of Chair man  Powell’s Press Conference  
March 21, 2018 
 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Good afternoon.  I have a brief statement, and then I’ll be 
happy to respond to your questions. 
The job market remains strong, the economy continues to expand, and inflation appears 
to be moving toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run goal.  As you already know, we decided 
today to raise the target rate  for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, bringing it to 1½ to  
1¾ percent.1  This decision marks another step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back 
monetary policy accommodation—a process that has been under way for several years now. 
Job gains averaged 240,000 per month over the past three months, well above the pace 
needed in the longer run to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  The unemployment rate remained low in February at 4.1 percent, while the labor force participation rate moved higher.  Over the past four years, the participation rate has remained roughly unchanged.  That’s a sign of improvement, given that the aging of our population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate, and we expect that the job market will remain strong.  
Although the growth rates of household spending and business investment appear to have 
moderat ed early this year, gains in the fourth quarter were strong and the fundamentals 
underpinning demand remain solid.  Indeed, the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.  Several factors are supporting the outlook:  F iscal policy has become more stimulative, 
ongoing job gains are boosting incomes and confidence, foreign growth is on a firm trajectory, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  
                                                 
1 Chairman Powell intended to say that the Committee had raised the target “range” for the federal funds rate.  
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 22  Against this backdrop, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.  
Overall consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, 
increased 1.7  percent in the 12 months ending in January.  The core price index, which excludes 
the prices of energy and food and is typically a better indicator of futur e inflation, rose 
1.5 percent over the same period.  However, as we have noted for some time, the shortfall of 
inflation from 2 percent reflects, at least partly, some unusual price declines that occurred nearly 
a year ago.  In coming months, as those earl ier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation 
should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.  Of 
course, various forces will continue to affect inflation.  A t times it may be above 2 percent, just 
as at times  it may be below.  Our inflation objective is symmetric in the sense that we are trying 
to prevent persistent deviations from 2 percent in either direction. 
Based on the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting, the 
median project ion for the growth of inflation- adjusted GDP is 2.7 percent this year, 2.4 percent 
next year, and 2 percent in 2020, a bit above its estimated longer -run rate.  The median 
projection for unemployment —for the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent in the f ourth 
quarter of this year and runs at 3.6 percent over the next two years, almost a percentage point 
below the median estimate of its longer -run normal rate.  Finally, the median inflation projection 
is 1.9 percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2020.  Compared with the 
projections made in December, real GDP growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is lower, 
and inflation is slightly higher.  
As I noted earlier, today’s decision to raise the federal funds rate is another step in the 
process of gradually scaling back monetary policy accommodation as the economic expansion 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 22  continues.  This gradual process has been under way for more than two years , and it has 
served —and should continue to serve —the economy well.  
In making our policy decisions over the next few years, we will continue to aim for 
inflation of 2 percent while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market.  In the 
Committee’s view, further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote these 
goals.  By contrast, raising rates too slowly  would raise the risk that monetary policy would need 
to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion.  At the same 
time, we want to avoid inflation running persistently below our  objective, which could leave us 
with less scope to counter an economic downturn in the future.  
Participants’ projections of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate reflect our 
gradual approach.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.1 percent at the end of 
this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020.  By 2020, the 
median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer -run trend.  Most participants 
revised up their projections since Decembe r, although the median projection for this year did not 
change.  The medians for 2019 and 2020 are somewhat higher than in December. 
Of course, we’ll be watching how the economy evolves in the months and years ahead 
relative to our maximum employment and p rice stability objectives.  If the outlook changes, we 
will adjust monetary policy appropriately.  
Finally, I’ll note that our program for reducing our balance sheet, which began in 
October, is proceeding smoothly.  Barring a very significant and unexpected weakening in the 
outlook, we do not intend to alter this program.  As we’ve said, changing the target range for the 
federal funds rate is our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  As always, 
the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 22  were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing 
the federal funds rate.  
Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your questions now. 
STEVE LIESMAN.   Mr. Chairman —rig ht, the microphone.  Mr. Chairman, welcome.  
Interesting changes in the forecast.   A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, 
lower unemployment seven -tenths  below the long run, a nd yet very little change in inflation.  
What does that say ab out what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic ?  And 
how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year —and I sense there’ll be three 
next year —and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet?  Where's 
your biggest concern here?  Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, you’re right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned 
and as you—as was in your question.  The Committee ’s estimates of growth went u p, the 
Committee ’s estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in 
inflation.  And I think that reflects, essentially —if you think back to the era after the crisis, 
unemployment was 10 percent.  It’s now 4.1 percent.  You ’ve only seen very gradual upward 
pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase.  And that suggests that the 
relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight.  But, it has diminished, but it ’s 
still there.  So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects 
the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here —is it doing too 
much, doing too little?  
CHAIRMAN POWEL L.  You know, I think we ’re trying to, we ’re trying to be, to take 
the middle ground there.  So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 22  long, and then we have to raise rates quickly , and that foreshortens the expansion.  We don’ t 
want to do that.  The —on the other side, if we —if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, 
really doesn ’t get sustainably up to 2 percent , and, that will hurt us going forward.  We need that, 
and it ’s, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expecta tions are anchored at 2  percent .  
So we ’re trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the 
middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the 
economy is broadly on this path. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  I’m Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair 
Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target—what you outlined in your remarks as 
preventing persistent deviations.  I want to understand what symmetry means in the  context of 
inflation b eing allowed to run above the 2 percent  target now that that ’s part of the projection 
for—at least for core PCE next year.  How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of 
the past five years?  Would the Fed be willing to a ccept the type of overshoot of its target as it 
has seen during the undershoot?  And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target 
that is symmetric?   Is it 2¼, 2½, 2¾ ?  And also, for how long?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.   You know, so as you noted, the —what we ’ve said in the 
longer -run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with 
sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below.  We ’ve also said —in 
minutes and in speeches and things like that —that  that is a symmetric objective.  So, that ’s how 
we think of it.  And, I think it ’s—I wouldn’ t characterize what we ’ve done over the last five 
years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation.  We were always pushing toward 
2 percent , and I think that is how we look at it.  I can ’t give you an exact number.  It just, you 
know, it, we haven ’t agreed on that.  It just is that we ’re always going to be seeking 2 percent 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 22  inflation.  And in doing that, we ’re going to be considering, by the way , the other side of the 
mandate.   You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from —
unemployment from its goal.  And —and also , just the duration of it as well.  
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Time s.  Even 
with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 
2.7 percent, and then—this year —and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020.  Is the 
continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bring ing growth to 3 per cent or higher on a 
sustained basis overselling their potential impact?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, let me say what that really is.  So the Summary of 
Economic Projections  is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts.  The C ommittee 
made really  one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points.  The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written 
down.  And, you ’ve identified the median as 2.7 percent .  I would—and that ’s an interesting 
statistic .  I would also say that the central tendency is interesting.  The full range is interesting.  
So you have a range of views around the table.  One of the great benefits of our system is that we 
do have R eserve Banks with their own s taffs and Governors with different views , and so we 
discuss these things.  So the C ommittee doesn ’t vote or agree upon the medians, so you ’re going 
to have a range of views.  That ’s really all I can say —2.7 just happens to be the median for ’ 18, 
but it doe sn’t really say, you know, what we think is possible. 
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say it ’s hard to say, but it would take —you 
know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long -run growth.  It 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 22  would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to 
get there.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg New s.  So obviously you 
guys reduced your NAIRU  estimate s slightly  today, but if you continue to see job gains around 
200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, 
moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether y ou’re 
actually overshooting full employment?  And, if you start to question that, how is that going to 
impact policy?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I guess I ’d start by saying that the natural rate of 
unemployment is not something that we can observe directly.  We look at a wide range of 
indicators on that —you know, 15 or 20 of them at least .  And also, I think we all understand that 
any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands .  So as the —as the actual 
unemployment rate has declined  from 10 perce nt to 4.1 percent , the Committee ’s median 
estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point.  So the 
Committee —and , I think, people —are generally influenced by data.  As they see unemployment 
going lower, they ’re loo king at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation 
and price inflation.  So I don’ t think we, we —we ’re mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we ’ll 
be looking at that.  So, as —if inflation —if unemployment does continue to go down, we ’ll 
continue to do that.  As I mentioned earlier, there is no —there’ s no sense in the data that we ’re 
on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation.  We have seen moderate increases in wages and price 
inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that.  We’ll be alert to that.  I guess the idea —the 
theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 22  period, you would see an acceleration of inflation.  So we would know that then, a nd we ’re very 
alert to it, but it’ s not something we observe at the present.  
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from Financial Times.  You and 
other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently.  Does that imply 
that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how 
would you assess the implications for monetary policy?  And s econd question—this is obviously 
your first press conference, so it ’s a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this 
more ofte n?  Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Longer -run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural 
rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow -
moving forces over time.  So they don’ t—they don’t  move around very much.  So I wouldn’ t 
expect the Committee ’s, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to 
move quickly.  They ’ll move slowly.  So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would 
move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expan sion?  There’ s literature that says that.  
There’s —there are reasons that that might be the case.  In fact, it did tick  up one -tenth , as you all  
know, in the —in the median at this time.  But it’ s—I think, generally speaking, the Committee  
sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not—is not seeing it as having moved up 
and is open to the possibility that it will.  
SAM FLEMING.   And p ress conferences ? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.   Ah, press conferences.  So that ’s something that I ’m go ing to 
be carefully considering.  I have not made a decision about it.  My colleagues and I are 
committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we ’re doing and why we ’re doing 
it.  I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 22  frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy.  And so, it is  something that I ’ll be 
thinking about. 
ADAM SHAPIRO.  Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network .  You brought up the 
fiscal stimulus and the impact it’ s having, and I was curious , how is the change in the federal 
budget deficit —because the stimulus is coming with great debt —has it changed your approach to 
how many securities you ’re going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of 
Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll -off, given how 
much the U.S. government ’s going to have to borrow going forward?   And, then a second 
question, things beyond your control —the President  is expected to announce  new tariffs against 
China, and does  the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to 
inflation ?  And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, in terms of the balance sheet, we ’ve said that , you know, 
we carefully developed this plan .  We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year.  We 
announced it, and we said we wouldn’ t change it , really , unless there were a significant downturn 
that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates.  And I have no inclination to 
revisit that.  We ’re going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our 
policy. 
So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring 
up the is sue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that , it was, first, that there ’s 
no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.  
Second thing is, I would say , is that a number of participants rep orted in —about their 
conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has 
become a concern going forward for that group.  
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 22  MART IN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press.  You talked 
about the fact that th e Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the 
members of the FOMC.  Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that 
was impacted by the—we had a $1½ trillion tax cut, w e’ve had $300 billion  in increased 
government spending —the staff forecast that you ’re working with, are those reflected —how 
were they impacted by that?   And how did that impact the discussions?  
CHAIRIMAN POWELL.  So w e look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts —and , 
by the way, the re are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their 
own work—w e look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers.  So —and it ’s really 
the policymakers ’ views that we talk about in the SEP .  We don’ t—we do n’t, you know, talk 
about the staff forecast.  It’s a particular thing under —done under particular rules and 
circumstances .  And, really, it ’s the policymakers that then take that as input and create their 
forecasts , which are what drive policy.  
MART IN CRUTSINGER.  That had no impact, though?   It’s s uch a—that ’s a major 
increase in government stimulus that you ’re—that had to have  had an impact on the discussions, 
I would think, though. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Well , the—you’re right.  So fiscal stimulus is a, y ou know, a 
meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of 
last year and this year.  And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of 
estimates, a range of literature, and did their ow n thinking and came up with their own estimates 
and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections —as their projections.  Those are 
not the staff ’s projections.  Those are our projections. 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 22  HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long, Washington Post .  I—what wil l it take to get to four 
rate hikes this year?  It ’s clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be 
appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back.  Is it 
concerns about these potential trade tariffs that  are going into effect?  Is it just that people want 
to wait and see a little longer before they raise?  Can you give us some more insight into why 
people didn’ t go to four this time —the media n—even though the economic projections look very 
healthy?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one 
decision at this meeting , and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25  basis points.  
The projections are really just individual projections t hat ar e submitted and then compiled.  And, 
you know, you ’re mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close , but, 
you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they ’ll 
change depending on the way the outlook for th e economy changes.  So that ’s really all I can 
say.  It could change up.  It could change down.  I wouldn’ t want to —for now, these are the best 
forecasts that people could make , and, you know, it could be that if the economy ’s a little bit 
stronger or a li ttle bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual.  
HEATHER LONG.  So it wasn ’t one factor that was pulling at the heart of the 
discussion ? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Not, no . 
JIM TANKERSLEY.  Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a 
productivity question.  On trade, what would have to happen in policy —and, in particular , in 
potential retaliation from countries around the world—for trade policy to become a concern for 
the Committee ’s outlook?  And then, the second question is , you mentioned productivity growth 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 22  earlier.  What ’s your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in 
policy —any policy change in recent months changed that assessment?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC 
participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns , which were relatively new , 
about —about  future trade actions, really.  And they ’re seeing it as a risk -to-the-outlook kind of 
thing.  So —and the kind of thi ngs people are talking about would be, you know, more 
widespread retaliation and more widespread actions  back -and-forth kind of thing.  I can ’t be any 
more specific than that.  
In terms of productivity —productivity, as I ’m sure you know, has been very weak  since 
the financial crisis.  It’s averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years , I guess.  So 
that’s well below, you know, longer -run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it 
move up.  It has moved up just a little bit but not , kind of , decisively.  
And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity.  I 
think in the tax bill there’s —there are incentives for —there— a tax cut bill that allows expensing 
of investments should encourage additional i nvestment that should encourage productivity.  In 
theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force 
participation.  So I do think it ’s very important that we have a focus on productivity in the 
country.  It’s not something that we can really do at the Fed , but, you know, we ’re certainly 
hopeful that there will be supply -side effects like that from the tax bill.  I think estimates are 
really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those.  
JONATHAN SPICE R.  Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters.  I take your 
caveats on the dot plot , as it were, but I ’ll ask another question.  In 2020, it shows that  
policymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3½ percent , which is quite a ways —or, 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 22  defini tively , anyways —above the neutral rate.  Does that increase the risk of a Fed -induced 
recession and decrease the risk of a soft landing?  Which is asking , in a way , about the fiscal 
policy .  And, as a follow -up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the F ed 
around this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of “ low rates ” 
environment?  Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say that —remember that forecasts  three 
years out —so, you’ re righ t, in 2020 there ’s a—I think it’s 3.4 percent  is the median of the SEP 
dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would 
characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly  tightening policy, but that’ s three years 
in the future.  It’s highly uncertain.  You know, we don’ t have the ability to see that far into the 
future, so I really wouldn ’t put a lot in that.  It could make sense.  You could imagine narratives 
in which that  would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn’ t put too much on that.  Sorry, your 
second question was?  
JONATHAN SPICER.   The second question was whether the secular stagnation 
narrative— whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that ? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we ’ve been throug h many years of growth around 
2 percent , and I ’ve given a number of public remarks where I ’ve called on, you know, the 
country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, wh ich 
drive potential growth.  So, you know, I think it ’s really important that we do something —do 
what we can as a country to increase our  potential growth rate.   I would say in the bill that passed 
Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs A ct, there were elements t hat should encourag e productivity, as 
I mentioned—sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor 
force participation.  We don’ t know how big those effects are going to be.  We don’ t know what 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 22  the timing would be.  I think , as you look around the table at the FOMC, there ’s a wide range of 
views on the amount and the timing of those.  I think all of us would agree that we hope that they 
will be large.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Hi.  Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires .  I have a question 
about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy.  I wanted to know whether you favor 
sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on ex cess reserves and reverse 
repo—the reverse repo rate to control interest rates —or do you want to s hift back to the old way 
of doing things at  some point of targeting the fed funds market?  And do you have any concern 
that if you do sti ck with the current system that , as rates rise, that you might see issues where the 
Fed is under —is being criticized fo r paying out ever larger shares of money to banks  to, you 
know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting 
this money?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  Our current framework for implementing monetary 
policy is wor king very well.  We have excellent contro l over rates, and it ’s working.  And it’s—
you described it accurately.   We haven ’t made a deci sion to keep that as our longer -run 
framework.  We haven ’t really addressed that question.  We ’ve had meetings where we’ ve talked 
about it, and we ’ve agre ed that it’ s working well.  But it’ s—and it ’s not something I see us as 
needing to urgently address.  I think we ’re continuing to learn about this framework.  For 
example, one —in the long -run, the size of the balance sheet  is going to depend on the public ’s 
demand for our liabilities , including currency and reserves.   So we don’ t know what the demand 
is for reserves in a world where you have —you know, you have regulations that require banks to 
hold lot s of high- quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those.  So it ’s not something we ’re 
looking at resolving in the near  term.  
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 22  You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it ’s a little bit of a 
misnomer to think that there ’s a subsidy there.  We pay interest on excess reserves.  We can ’t 
pay interest on excess reserves that are —is above the general level of short -term interest rates.  
So we ’re paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other —any other 
investment in the short -term money markets.  In addition, r emember that those liabilities —those 
are our liabilities.  The assets that we have on the other side are T reasury securities and 
mortgage -backed securities , which yield much higher than interest on reserves.  So, in fact, i t’s 
not a subsidy, and it ’s not a cost to the taxpayer.  
GREG ROBB.  Over here.  Thank you, Chairman.  Thank you very much.  Greg Robb 
from MarketWatch.  Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing 
concern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances.   I was wondering if 
you could give us your view on the asset markets.  Are—do you see any bubbles?   And do you 
have the tools you need, you think, to combat those?   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Since the financial crisis, we’ ve been monitoring financial 
conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings 
about the staff framework and , sort of , measures of various aspects of financial —financial  
stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are 
moderate, let ’s say .  And I’ll go through a couple of pieces of that. 
So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see 
higher capital.  You see much higher liquidity.  You see them more aware of their risks and 
better able to m anage them with stress testing.  And if one —if something does go wrong, you’ ve 
got—you’ve got  better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions.  So, therefore, you 
don’t see high leverage.  You don’ t see excess risk -taking in great quantity the way you did s ee 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 22  before the crisis.  If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better 
condition.  If you look at nonf inancial corporations, you see —you do see relatively elevated 
levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks.  And, of course, default 
rates are very low.   So those readings look okay.  I should mention also that for large financia l 
institutions, they ’re no longer funded by a lot of short -term wholesale funding, which can 
disappear very quickly , so they ’re far less vulnerable to liquidity issues.  Overall, those aspects, I 
think, suggest low levels of vulnerability.  
You identified t he—really, one area where—which is an area of focus , which is asset 
prices.  So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer -run historical norms.  
You can think of some equity prices.  You can think of commercial real estate prices i n certain 
markets.  But  we don’ t see it in housing, which is key.  And so, overall, if you put all of that into 
a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities , in our view.  In terms of whether we have the 
tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we ce rtainly —we use them.   We have— I think 
the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for 
the smaller financial institutions.  We regularly use that to —as a way to test against various, you 
know, mar ket shocks, c ertainly for the larger institutions.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  More on the regulatory side, you 
know, the F ed might soon be getting more power to de cide exactly which regulations —which 
stricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets.  And so I had 
a couple of questions about that.  So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that ’s based around, you 
know, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict divi dend payouts or stock 
buybacks, i s there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don’ t have CCAR 
every year for certain banks?  Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis?  
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 22  And then, m y other question is, you know, you’ve talked a lot about how size isn ’t the 
only thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering , what other factors do 
you think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay.  So, this is a matter that Congress has under 
consideration.  It’s not something —so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying 
enhanced financial standards to—f rom $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the 
ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it ’s appropriate.  
And, you know, we haven’ t been shy about doing that , because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs  
is below 250 already.  So we are fully prepared to do that.  But this is a decision t hat’s in the 
hands of Congress .  It’s not something th at’s been —been  taken.  The version of the bill, I think, 
that passed the Senate did have —did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests 
periodically , as opposed to annually , is the language.  We haven ’t made any decision about that 
at all.  We woul d want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would—whatever 
we do decide to do, we ’d put that out  for comment.  Is it, you know, logistically possible?  I 
would think it would be, but it ’s certainly not something that we ’ve decided to do.  And the 
second question you had was?  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   About w hat causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size . 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  Well, it’ s—I guess the next thing on the list would be 
activities.  So, you know, we —regular  way c ommercial banks that  do deposit  taking and lending 
and don’ t specu late in markets, y ou know, that ’s one business model.  Another business model 
might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right?   That ’s what they do.  They ’re 
speculating on markets, and— you know, so ver y different business models and different levels 
of risk and that sort of thing.  So, that ’s—that would be the next thing on the list.  I mean, there 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 22  would be a range of things, you know —how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those 
things. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I’d like to 
go back to the idea of the additional growth that you’ re getting from the fiscal package and ask 
you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand?   You use  
words like  “might ” and “ should”  about what results should come from this process , but, around 
the table, did any of the presidents or G overnors report that businesses are actually getting ready 
to spend?   Is this something that’ s going to happen?   Do we know that there ’s going to be a 
supply -side effect, or are you just guessing at this point?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Remember that there ar e 15 FOMC participants, and we —each 
of us has his or her own forecast.  So there ’s a real diversity of views on this, pa rticularly on 
these fiscal issues.  If I could try to summarize, it woul d be that , I think, broadly speaking , 
participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for 
at least the next, let ’s say, three years.  I think there ’s a general view as well that supply -side 
issues—that there could  be supply -side effects as well, and  you would see that again through 
higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment , 
which would drive —tend to drive productivity over time.  If you make investment more 
attractive, companies should do more  of it.  It’s uncertain, though.  I mean, I spent many years of 
my life working with companies and discussing—and , you know, the cost of capital is one  of 
many factors that they ’ll consider.  It isn ’t the only factor or the principle factor, but it should 
result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity.  
At the same time, the —you know, I mentioned labor supply.  You should see some labor  
supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates.  The whole thing is very 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 22  uncertain, and particularly the supply -side effects should and would be expected to take longer to 
appear and would be less certain in amount.  So that ’s really  as good as you can go.  And, you 
know, we ’ve all looked at the literature carefully.  We’ve all thought about it.  We ’ve discussed 
it with our in -house experts and come up with our own views, a nd they ’re disparate, but that ’s—
I’d say that ’s about where the —where the views are.  
DONNA BORAK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Just to go back to trade 
policy, if you don’ t mind.  You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade 
policy shouldn’ t necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there 
was any discussio n—if there are fears about inflationary effects , should t here be trade barriers 
imposed?  And, secondly, you know, we  might be on the verge of a tit- for-tat trade war with 
China.  Wondering wha t your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic —the global 
economic outlook going forward should that occur . 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants 
discussed —it wasn ’t—it was —it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low -
profile risk , which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook.  That ’s really 
what people were saying.  They didn ’t get into talking about particular —you know, whether it ’s 
inflation or growth or whatever it would be.   So that ’s not something that did come up.  You 
know —your second question, sorry, was China?  
DONNA BORAK.  Ye s.  I mean, in the event t hat the United States and China —in the 
event that the  U.S. and China end up in a tit -for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that 
are imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic 
outlook, and whether that was something that was discussed a nd are you worried about . 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 22  CHAIMRAN POWELL.   That didn’ t—it’ s not something that ca me up in particular.  
And, let me say, you know, we don’ t do trade policy here at the F ed, and, you know, I would be 
reluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Does the 
interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough?  Are you satisfied with 
the rate of wage growth right now?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  As I mentioned, you know, we ’ve had unemployment decli ne 
sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and 
we’ve seen only modest increases in wages.  So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory 
represent is inflation plus productivity increases.  You should get paid for yo ur productivity plus 
inflation .  And productivity ’s been very low.  Inflation ’s been low.  So these low wage 
increases —in a sen se, they do make sense in that —from that perspective.  
On the other hand, as the market ha s tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we 
hear reports of labor shortages and  we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are 
diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, w e haven ’t seen, you know, higher 
wages —wages going up more.  And  I would— I think I ’ve been surprised by that, and I think 
others have as well.  In terms of what ’s the right level, I don ’t think I have a view on what the 
right level of wages is, but I think we will —we will know that the labor market is getting tight 
when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages.  
VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie  Montet with Agenc e France -Presse.   If the economy 
behaves as the F ed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be —keep on 
rising, a nd the prime r ate wi ll be above —well above 5 percent , a level not reached in 10 years 
for what is a base of consumer credit.  And we know that , historically, raising rates —especially 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 22  in campaign times —has never been very popular in the White House.  Does this prospect of a 
possible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  No.  That doesn’ t keep me awake at night.  We don’ t consider 
the election cycle.  You know, we —we ’re looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities 
of maximum employment, stable prices, and that ’s really our focus.  You can count on us to stay 
focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to 
achieve them.  You ’re right, that ’s the highest rate.  By the way, I ’m hearin g this, the 10- year 
thing a few times these day s, and it ’s true that rates are higher than they ’ve been in 10 years.  On 
the other hand, the economy ’s healthier than it’ s been since—since  before the financial crisis.  
So, it ’s a healthier economy than it ’s been in 10 years.  The financial crisis, of course, was just 
really getting going 10 years ago.  
MYLES UDLAND.  Thanks.  My les Udland, Yahoo Finance.  Ch air Powell, I ’m curious 
if the F ed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve.  We continue t o see the spread 
between the 2 -year and the 10- year tighten , even with longer -term yields coming up since the 
beginning of the year.  This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we’ re likely 
to see sh orter -term rates come up as the F ed continues to increase rates.  So, I ’m just curious if 
you guys have discussed that, if you’ d be willing to push back against that , or if that’ s a dynamic 
you’d be comfortable with?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, it ’s an interesting question, and ther e are a range of 
views there.  I think it ’s true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back 
over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was  allowed to get out of 
control, and the F ed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession.  That ’s really not 
the situation we ’re in now, so I don ’t know that that ’s—I don’ t know that —I don ’t think that 
March 21, 2018  Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 22  recession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are.  
But, havin g said that, I think it’ s—there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or 
inverted yield curve does to intermediation.  It’s hard to find in the research data, but 
nonetheless, I think those are issues that we ’ll be watching carefully.  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference  
June 13, 2018 
 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Good afternoon.  Thanks very much for being here .  I know 
that a number of you will want to talk about the details of our announcement today, and I am 
happy to do that in a few minutes.  But because monetary policy affects everyone, I want to start with a plain -English summary of how the economy is doing, what my colleagues and I at the 
Federal Rese rve are trying to do, and why. 
The main takeaway is that the economy is doing very well.  Most people who want to 
find jobs are finding them, and unemployment and inflation are low.  Interest rates have been low for some years while the economy has been recovering from the financial crisis.  For the past few years, we have been gradually raising interest rates, and along the way we’ve tried to explain the reasoning behind our decisions.  In particular, we think that gradually returning interest rates to a more normal level as the economy strengthens is the best way the Fed can help s ustain an 
environment in which American households and businesses can thrive.  Today, we’ve taken another step in that process by raising our target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ of a percentage point. 
My colleagues and I meet eight times a year and take a fresh look each time at what is 
happening in the economy and consider whether our policy needs adjusting.  We don’t put our interest rate decisions on hold or on autopilot, because the economy can always evolve in unexpected ways.  History has shown that moving interest rates either too quickly or too slowly can lead to bad economic outcomes.  We think the outcomes are likely to be better overall if we are as clear as possible about what we are likely to do and why.  To that end, we try to give a sense of our expectations for how the economy will evolve and how our policy stance may change.  
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 26 
 As Chairman, I hope to foster a public conversation about what the Fed is doing to 
support a strong and resilient economy.  And one practical step in doing so is to have a press 
conference like this after every one of our scheduled FOMC meetings.  And we’re going to do that beginning in January.  That will give us more opportunities to explain our actions and to answer your questions.  I want to point out that having twice as many press conferences does not signal anything about the timing or pace of future interest rate changes.  This change is only about improving communications.  My FOMC colleagues and I will also continue to issue our economic projections on the existing quarterly schedule.  
Now, let me go into more detail over developments in the economy, our economic 
projections, and our policy decision.  Economic growth appears to have picked up in the current quarter, largely reflecting a bounceback in household spending.  Business investment continues to grow strongly, and the overall outlook for growth remains favorable.  Several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal policy is boosting the economy, ongoing job gains are raising incomes and confidence, foreign economies continue to expand, and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  These observations are consistent with the projections that Committee participants submitted for this meeting.  The median projection for the growth of real GDP is 2.8 percent this year, 2.4 percent next year, and 2  percent in 2020.  Compared with the 
projections made in March, this median growth path is little changed. 
In the labor market, job gains averaged 180,000 per month over the past three months, 
well above th e pace needed in the longer run to provide jobs for new entrants into the workforce.  
The unemployment rate declined over the past two months and stood at 3.8 percent in May, its lowest level in nearly two decades.  Meanwhile, the labor force participation  rate has been 
roughly unchanged since late 2013.  That is a positive sign, given that the aging of our 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 26 
 population is putting downward pressure on the participation rate.  And we expect the job market 
to remain strong.  As you can see in our Summary of Economic Projections, the median of Committee participants’ projections for the unemployment rate stands at 3.6  percent in the fourth 
quarter of this year and runs at 3.5 percent over the next two years, a percentage point below the median estimate of its lon ger-run normal rate.  This median path is just a bit lower than that from 
March.  
After many years of running below our 2  percent longer-run objective, inflation has 
recently moved close to that level.  Indeed, overall consumer prices, as measured by the pr ice 
index for personal consumption expenditures, increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April.  The core PCE index, which excludes prices of energy and food and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation, rose 1.8 percent over the same period.  As we had expected, inflation moved up as the unusually low readings from last March dropped out of the calculation.  The recent inflation data have been encouraging, but after many years of inflation below our objective, we do not want to declare victory.  We want to ensure that inflation remains near our symmetric 2  percent longer-run goal on a sustained basis.  As we note in our Statement of 
Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, the Committee would be concerned if inflation 
were running persistently above or below our 2 percent objective.  Of course, many factors affect inflation —some temporary and others more lasting—and at any given time inflation may be 
above or below 2 percent.  For example, the recent rise in oil prices will likely pu sh inflation 
somewhat above 2 percent in coming months.  But that transitory development should have little, if any, consequence for inflation over the next few years.  The median of participants’ projections for inflation runs at 2.1 percent through 2020.  Relative to the March projections, the median inflation projection is a little higher this year and next.  
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 26 
 As I mentioned, today we took another step in gradually scaling back monetary policy 
accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds  rate by ¼  percentage point, 
bringing it to 1¾  to 2 percent.  We also made some changes to our policy statement, reflecting 
that policy normalization is proceeding broadly as we have expected.  None of these changes 
signals a change in our policy views.  F or example, we removed the language stating that “the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  Since we introduced that language a few years ago, the economy has strengthened, and the Committee has raised the federal funds rate from near 0  to 1¾ to 2 percent.  
As we continue to note in our statement, we expect to make further gradual increases in that rate.  As a result, if the economy evolves broadly as we anticipate, the federal funds rate will, over the next year or so, move well within the range of estimates of the normal long -run level.  Therefore, 
we thought that now is an appropriate time to remove this forward guidance from our policy statement.  
We continue to believe that a gradual approach for increasing the federal funds rate will 
best promote a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2  percent goal.  We are aware that raising rates too slowly might 
raise t he risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road in response to 
an unexpectedly sharp increase in inflation or financial excesses, jeopardizing the economic expansion.  Conversely, if we raise interest rates too rapidly, the econom y could weaken , and 
inflation could continue to run persistently below our objective. 
The Committee’s gradual approach is reflected in participants’ projections for the 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  The median projection for the federal funds rate is 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

 2020.  By 2020, the median federal funds rate is modestly above its estimated longer-run level.  
These projections are very similar to those made in March.  Although the median federal funds rate edged up this year and next, most participants did not revise their projections. 
I’ll conclude by mentioning two additional matters.  First, our program for reducing our 
balance sheet, which began in Octobe r, is proceeding smoothly.  Barring a material and 
unexpected weakening in the outlook, this program will proceed on schedule, and our balance sheet will continue to shrink.  As we have said, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our prim ary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  
And, finally, as discussed in the minutes of our May meeting, we’re making a small 
technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy.  To keep the federal funds rate in the targe t range, we rely on the rate of interest on excess reserves, or the IOER rate.  
Up until now, we have set the IOER rate at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  In recent months, the federal funds rate has moved up toward the IOER rate as short- term 
interest rates have risen more generally.  So to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range, we are now setting the IOER rate 5  basis points below the upper end of the 
target range.  This minor technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path for the federal funds rate or financial conditions more generally.  Thanks for listening, and I’ll be happy to take your questions. 
JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times .  I have a 
question about inflation and a question about growth.  On inflation, I’m curious if there’ s 
anything that’s happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come.  And , on growth, you m entioned fiscal

Page 6 of 26 
 policy is adding to growth, and I’m curious if you could break that down a li ttle bit further for us 
and say—what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So since—I wouldn’ t say anything has h appened since 
March to really change the way I ’m thinking about inflation or the way the Committee ’s thinking 
about inflation.  We’ve seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective.  
And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation—measured inflation —down.  Part of it is just that continued tightening in the 
labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up.  So we continue to think, and the Committee continu es to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I 
mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven’t done yet. 
You also asked about fiscal policy, and there’ s a range of views on the Committee and , I 
think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally.  But I can say that the Committee members —Committee participants —generally believe that the fiscal changes —and 
that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes—will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years.  And the question—the other question is, what about the supply side?  So it is— it makes 
sense that if you lower corporate tax rates an d allow faster expensing of investment, you will 
encourage greater investment.  That should drive productivity.  That should increase potential output.  So that really ought to happen as well.  I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain.  There’s also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain.  So that’s how the Committee generally is thinking about—about fiscal policy.

 NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  So the Fed is about 
four interest rate increases , using the projections released today, away from what might be 
considered a neutral fed funds rate.  And I wanted to ask how you’re thinking about what to do 
once you get to neutral.  Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it’ s 
okay to stop raising rates?  And under what conditions would you want to keep going? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL .  So for many, many years, we’ ve been far from maximum 
employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been —has been 
clear.  As the economy has strengthened and as we’ ve gradually raised interest rates, the question 
comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative?  And how will you know?  How will you know where—at what point policy will be neutral?  Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it.  So we know that we’ re 
getting closer to that neutra l level.  We don’ t have an exact sense of how that will be.  So the 
Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise.  And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy?  And, you know, I—you asked, how will we kno w?  So 
I think we’ll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market.  We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment.  But also, what is the neutral rate of interest ?  What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down?  So I think we—
we’ll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move 
forward.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  2.1 percent above target for 
two and a half years  starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 26 
 here, be it price- level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2.  In 
deciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, the—our target for —our medium- term objective 
for inflation is 2  percent PCE inflation.  We feel that that target has served the econom y well, 
and I ’m strongly committed to it.  The Committee is strongly committed to it.  The sort of 
barriers to making a material change to that would be —would be very high because, again, we 
think it’s fundamental, and we think it’s worked. 
You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing.  You know, there are some 
ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower , we’ re near the zero lower 
bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we’ re going to be down 
at the  zero  lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation 
objective.  So the idea is to have kind of a makeup.  If you—if you ’re below target for a while, 
you have a—you have a time of being above target.  And the idea is to enhance the credibility of 
that 2  percent —that 2  percent target.  This is an idea that ’s been written about for many years.  
It’s not something that the Committee has looked at seriously.  I imagine we will be having 
discussions about it, but—not something that we have on the calendar right now. 
SAM FLEMING.  Well, thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times .  
Over the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7.  In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and  retaliatory action from major 
U.S. trading partners.  How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy?  And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions?  Is there something that’s beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies?  Thanks. 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 26 
 CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I ought to star t by saying that, you know, Congress has 
assigned us very important jobs and—you know, maximum employment, stable prices , we have 
a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies.  Congress has very specifically 
given authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn’ t comment on any particular 
specific trade actions.  I will say that we, of course, have—we have broad contacts in —among 
business leaders around the country.  And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that.  And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting.  And they do 
come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it’ s fair to 
say, and also that you’re beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people.  So right now we don’ t see that in the numbers at all.  The 
economy is very strong.  The labor market is strong.  Growth is strong.  We really don’ t see it in 
the numbers.  It’s just not there.  But—so I w ould put it down as more of a risk. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, you said there’ s a difference 
of opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there ’s not a whole lot of difference.  It ’s 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending 
upon how you count it.  Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee—including yourself, Mr. Chairman—agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long -run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher?  Do you believe in 
that?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, first of all, that’ s a—that ’s a reasonable range, I 
think, of—it’s not that we’ re all on the same number, but there are a range of views about 
potential gr owth.  And there’s so much uncertainty around this.  You know, we don’t—the thing 
about fiscal policy is, you don’t have thousands of incidents to, you know, to—you don’ t have 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 26 
 big data, in a way.  You have very small data.  You’ve got only a few instances here, so you have 
a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be.  They could be large.  We hope they’ re large.  
But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we’ re just going to 
have to see.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  How would you forecast it though? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think we ’re looking at a reasonable range of estimates and 
we’re putting every —different participants are putting differ ent estimates in and we’ re going to 
be waiting and seeing.  
DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  You said earlier that it’ s still a little too 
early to declare victory on inflation.  I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what—what  does the Fed say  in regards to the inflation target as 
symmetric ?  Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it 
would be rising above—whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long?  And now that you’re planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain —how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not 
overrunning? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, what we ’ve said in our Statement of Longer-Run 
Principles  and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation 
were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent.  And that’s what we mean by symmetric.  We ’re looking at it equally on either side and it’ s a matter of 
persistent overruns.  We know that inflation is going to bounce around.  For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there ’s a good chance that headline inflation will move up above 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 26 
 2 percent because of oil prices.  Things buffet inflation back and forth, but—so we acknowledge 
that, we understand that—and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target.  We do understand, though, that we don’ t have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that 
inflation will be above or below.  And we just hope that that is—happens on a symmetric basis.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty C rutsinger, Associated Press.  At this meeting, you 
hiked your —the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you 
took out a sentence that you’d been using for years about how long rates might stay low.  But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views.  But shouldn’ t we see from this 
combination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing 
to make progress.  The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years.  The economy is in a very different place.  We— unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis.  It’s 3.8 percent now and moving lower.  So reall y what you —the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great 
shape.  Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that’ s what 
you’re seeing.  For many years, as I mentioned —many years —we had inter est rates held low to 
support economic activity.  And it’ s been clear that as we’ve gotten closer to our statutory goals, 
we should normalize policy, and that’ s really what we’ve been consistently doing for some years 
now. 
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Heather Long from the Washington Post .  Can 
you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages?  Are we finally going to see that 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 26 
 wage growth pickup this year?  I know you’ re forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that 
going to translate through to wage growth? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, wages have been gradually moving up.  Earlier in 
the recovery, they were —there are many different wage measures, of course, but —so just—but 
just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they’ve moved gradually up 
into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger.  I think it’ s fair 
to say that some of us— and I certain ly would have expected wages to react more to the very 
significant reduction in unemploym ent that we ’ve had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 
3.8 percent.  Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we’ ve talked 
about at the Committee and elsewhere.  But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages —that in a world where we’re hearing lots and lots about 
labor shortages—everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages— but where is the wage 
reaction?  So it ’s a bit of a puzzle.  I wouldn’ t say it’s a mystery, but it’ s a bit  of a puzzle. 
And, frankly, I do think there’s a lot to like about low unemployment.  And one of the 
things is —you will see —pretty much people who want to get jobs—not everybody—but people 
who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs.  You will see wages go up.  You’ ll 
see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work.  They benefit from that.  Society benefits from that.  So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked.  Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, 
which is why we ’re gradually raising rates.  
DON LEE.  Just a follow-up on—Don Lee from the L.A. Times .  On both inflation and 
unemployment, the new projections—for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher.  
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 26 
 And how much is the Fed willing to accept that’s an overshoot for both of those before it affects 
policy? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You ment ioned that unemployment moved down and  inflation 
moved up by truly small amounts.  If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick  between now and March.  And you asked, you 
know—I mean, I think we ta ke a longer -run view that we’re shooting for— we’re aiming for —
2 percent inflation —inflation around 2 percent.  We know that it’ll be above or below.  We’ re 
not going to—we didn’t overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent.  We won ’t 
overreact t o it being over 2 percent.  And I think we’ll always be using our tools to move 
inflation in the direction of the target, if it—if it leaves —if it moves away from the target 
persistently, as I mentioned. 
In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are—no one 
really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time.  And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older.  Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates.  We don’t know this with precision.  So we have to be learning as we go.  We’ve got to be looking at data and informed by what’s coming in.  And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ ve learned —as 
unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’ t really reacted.  So I can ’t give you a precis e 
number, but I just—you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data.  And this uncertainty is why —the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we ’ve been gradually raising 
rates.  We’re not waiting for inflation to show up.  We’re go ing ahead  and moving gradually and 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 26 
 trying to navigate between two risks, really.  One would be moving too quickly—inflation never 
gets back to target  if we do that.  And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have—we 
have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly.  And that can also have bad outcomes. 
CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. Chairman, I have a 
couple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves.  And you mentioned, of course, that —that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20  basis points, and that’ s a result , as 
you said , of the upward drift of the effect ive fed funds rate in that target range.  Do you think that 
that’s going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in 
the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range?  And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what’ s causing that?  Is it purely technical, 
perhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves?  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thanks.  So I would say that—remember the important thing is 
that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range.  That ’s the whole, the whole idea.  
IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen.  And we’ve said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate.  We don’ t expect 
to have to do this often or again, but we’re not sure about that.  If we have to do it again, we’ll do it again.  Again, don’t expect it to happen.  You asked why.  And yes, you know, we—of course, we’re looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don’t—we don ’t know with any 
precision.  Really, no one does.  It’s— you can ’t run experiments, you know, with one effect and 
not the other.  You know, I think there’s a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 26 
 federal funds rate toward s IOER.  We don’t know that that’s the only effect and, you know, 
we’re just going to have to be watching and learning.  And, frankly, we don’t have to know 
today.  What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that’ s what 
this minor technical adjustment accomplishes.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  So with the numbers 
that we ’re looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing.  Are 
we seeing a— with the fiscal policy —a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower 
natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Your question—your first question, really, is, do we think the 
natural rate of unemployment is lower?  So I think we do believe it has moved down 
significantly over a long period of time.  We don’t think that the natural rate of unemployment—you know, it’s not one of those variables that moves around a lot.  It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that.  So, you know, it may—it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis , lower.  As th e economy gets hotter and hotter, there’s some possibility of that.  But, you 
know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which a re—which 
are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the—by the incoming data.  
You asked about inflation.  You know, inflation we look about—we look at the 2 percent 
inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed , really  control.  And we have to be 
strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that.  I think in—in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary—have been pushing down on inflation.  And 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 26 
 so we ’ve been pushing back up.  Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the 
opposite.  Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down.  It’ s really 
important that inflation not fall below 2  percent , that inflation expectations remain well anchore d 
at 2 percent —very important—because the implications of inflation below 2  percent are that 
you’re closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we’ ll 
spend more time there and we won ’t be able to do the job that we’ re assigned to do for our 
citizens.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television.  You guys moved the 
median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer- run at 
4.5 percent today.  But you’ re only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate 
beyond your longer-run value.  How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to 
that 4.5 percent rate?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would just —would—I would just emphasize, emphasize 
that—a couple things.  First, we’ re learning about the real location of the natural rate of 
unemployment as we go.  So it’s moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012.  So it’s not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we ’ve just got to go ahead and get that rate up.  If 
you—if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you’ re still seeing inflation 
very close to target.  So there’s no sense that inflation will—no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts—that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly  quickly from these 
levels, even if unemployment does remain low.  So that’s—that ’s what —so it’ s important to 
know that the—the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts.  And so each person who’ s submitting  them is submitting accommodate —you 
know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person’s assessment.  And their 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 26 
 assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent.  
So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we’d be showing higher rates, but that’s not what we think will happen. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  If I could just follow up really quickly.  Then why, I guess, would 
the longer- run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yeah, it may be.  It may be.  We may find that out.  You know, 
the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that.  Although, you know, there’ s a range 
of views, you know.  Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but ¾ of a percent, that kind of thing, so it’s very possible.  We have to be, you know— we can ’t do—we can ’t be too attached to these 
unobservable variables.  You know, we—I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  I have a couple of regulatory questions.  First of all, on the 
countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two?  And then my second question is, there’ s been a lot of 
talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise 
capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  That’s the language that we’ve used.  And that’ s certainly a 
possibility.  I wouldn’ t say that—I wouldn't look at today’ s financial stability landscape and sa y 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 26 
 that risks are meaningfully above normal.  I would say that they’re roughly at normal.  You 
have—you know, households are well—you know, are in good shape.  They’ re—they’ ve paid  
down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs.  So households are not really a concern.  And banks are highly capitalized, so that’ s not really a concern.  We see—there’s some concern 
with asset prices in a couple of pockets.  But overall, if you—if you bake it all  in, I think we see, 
generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate.  Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years?  Yeah, it could. 
You also asked about marijuana businesses.  So this is a very difficult area because we 
have state law —many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn ’t.  So it 
puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation.  I think it would be great if that could be clarified.  We don’t have—you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position.  And, of course, this isn’t our—our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don’t really —we just would love to see it clarified, I think.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker .  So since you—since even 
before you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee , you 
laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that ’s actually been pretty consistent .  So there was 
the guidance on boards of governors, there was the—some changes to the stress tests, and —not 
changes to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling —and now, more recently, the 
changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio.  The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer.  Are these kind of the—are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just—are you kind of done for the time being?  Or what el se can we 
expect from the Fed?  
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 26 
 CHAIRMAN POWELL.  It ’s actually a pretty full docket right now.  You mentioned a 
number of the things , but I would—I would point out—we ’re having, I guess, a public Board 
meeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision.  We’ve also got quite a lot of 
work to promulgate rules to—after S. 2155 that  Senator Crapo’ s bill passed —we’ ve got  a lot of 
work to do under that.  We’ve got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level. 
So what am I missing?  There’s —there —oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be 
done.  So there’s a lot of work to do, I think.  You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago.  We went to work for 10 years to 
strengthen it—stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning.  We want to keep all that stuff.  We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient.  We want to tailor those regulations for institutions.  We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions.  And so we ’re committed to preserving 
and enhancing that structure.  But we—we ’re finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring 
regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that’s a lot of what we’ re 
working on right now. 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  You said at the beginning of your press conference that you 
plan to be more plainspoken.  And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you’ve laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see.  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape.  If 
you look at household surveys, confidence is high.  Look at businesses, confidence is high.  If you ask —if you survey workers about the job market, they’ ll say that it’s a really good 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 26 
 environment to find jobs.  If you survey businesses, they’ ll say that workers are scarce.  So I 
think overall, we have—we have a really solid economy on our hands here.  And so what we’ re 
doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep 
the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above—right at—sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent.  That ’s really what we’re trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so 
far.  We ’re—we ’ve been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly.  I think we’ ve been 
patient.  I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to.  We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I’ m really glad we didn ’t.  But, at this time, the —
continuing on that gradual pace seems—continues to seem like the right thing.  If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we’ ll certainly react to that.  
DAVID HARRISON.  Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires.  Where do you 
see the neutral interest rate is right now?  Do you think it’s—do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures?  And how will you know when we’ re getting 
close to that neutral point?  So if—you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn’t go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the 
Committee, which I think is 2¼  to 3½, and the median is 2.9, right in there.  So that’ s the range 
of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest.  And we do understand that there’s high uncertainty around the level, but that’s kind of—so you can think of 2.9 as being—which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today’s decision.  You asked, is the—is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy?  Yes.  I mean , 
there’s—there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let’s say.  Again, though, they were estimating these things.  It’ s one 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 26 
 of these unobserved variables so it’s very hard to—we shouldn’ t try to speak about it with a —
with a lot of precision or confidence.  But, yes, that should put upward pressur e on it.  How will 
we know?  Well, I think you have to look at inflation.  You’ve got to look at— you’ve got to look 
at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at 
what ’s happening in the job market.  And inflat ion is really important.  It ’s worth noting that the 
last two business cycles didn’ t end with high inflation —they ended with financial instability —so 
that’s something we need to also keep our eye on. 
VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse.  Have you talked 
during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word “accommodative” that describe the monetary policy for almost 10  years?  And could this change in the vocabulary 
make the market nervous?  And have you thought already at some options so to know how you’re going to call it down the road? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes, that is —that is something that we discuss.  We look at all 
the language.  As you know, we made a—we made a significant number of changes at this  
meeting.  So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes.  That’ s 
what happens.  We really —our approach to policy hasn’t changed.  And, you know, as I 
mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has  needed accommodative monetary policy.  As 
the economy has recovered, we’ ve been gradually raising rates and we will —we will be at a 
place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral.  And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative.  We know that’s coming.  We kind of don’ t think it’s here yet, but it’s certainly coming.  And I think 
that the market will understand that.  I mean , the real message is that you ’re getting close to the 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 26 
 neutral rate.  It ’s a characterization about where policy is.  It ’s not a statement , really , that should 
upset the markets.  But, you know, we’ll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and 
communicate about it.  So. 
NAOATSU AOYAMA.  Thank you very much.  Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi 
Shimbun, Japan ’s newspaper.  Would you expand on the—on your views on the downside 
risks —downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues?  Many people are—in the key allies 
of the United States —are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of 
the international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment.  So —and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the 
global economy as well as the U.S. economy.  So would you—have you —can I have your views 
on that? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sure.  So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I’ m really 
committed to staying in our lane on things.  We have very important jobs assigned to us by 
Congress and that’ s maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability.  Trade is explicitly 
assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us.  So we don’ t really —we don’ t really 
seek to play a role in trade policy.  We’ re not at that table.  Those are—those powers and 
decisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do.  And, you know, I—as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I’ ve just mentioned what those are.  There is 
—there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive.  And I also—as I also mentioned, we don’t see it in th e numbers yet.  We really don’ t.  We see a very strong economy across a bunch 
of fronts.  It hasn’ t reached everyone, let ’s be clear on that.  But most people who want a job can 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 26 
 find one .  We’re well aware that there are pockets out there of people who hav e not felt the 
recession yet, but, broadly speaking, it’s a good economy.1 
STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for 
NPR.  About financial conditions, which worries you more—warnings that rising short- term 
rates are b ringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very 
slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20  basis points below their recent high?  How do you account for 
the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise?  And what does it say about the inflation 
outlook as well? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So let me —let me briefly mention the yield curve.  I mean, I —
the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants.  And I —you have a range of views.  It’ s something we’re going to continue to be talking about.  
It’s—but it’s only one of many things, of course, that we talk about.  I think that that discussion 
is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate.  How do we understand what the neutral rate is?  How do we know where it is?  And what are the consequences of being above or below it?  That ’s really what —when people are 
talking about the slope of the yield curve, that’ s really what they ’re talk ing about.  We know 
why—we know why the yield curve is flattening.  It’ s because we ’re raising the federal funds 
rate.  It makes all the sense in the world tha t the short end would come up. 
I think you asked—the harder question is, what’s happening with long rates?  And there 
are many things that move long rates around.  Of course, there’ s an embedded expectation of the 
path of short rates.  There’s the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards.  And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it.  In 
                                                 
1 Chairman Powell intended to say that there are pockets of people in the United States  who have not yet 
experienced the economic recovery . 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 26 
 addition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk -on, risk -
off.  In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries , and you see—you know, 
Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot.  So—but I think ultimately, you know, what 
we’re—what we really care about is what ’s the appropriate stance of  policy.  And there’ s a—
there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that’ s why 
people are paying attention to the yield curve. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  
Companies are buyin g back their shares at a record rate.  Corporate debt is up.  Consumer debt is 
rising.  Are we in a credit bubble?  Is that something that you’ re worried about?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit 
growth , you don’ t see high levels of credit going out.  So not so much households.  And that 
really was where the problems were before the financial crisis , was particularly in —among 
household borrowing, particularly around mortgages.  With—if you take banks, then, of cours e, 
their leverage is significantly lower.  Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher.  If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that’ s really where leverage is at levels that are high 
relative to history.  But defaults are low, inte rest rates are low, you know, so it’s something—
that’s something we’re watching very carefully.  But, again, I don’ t think we see it as —I think 
there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates.  Households are in good shape, though, and that is—that is so important because that’ s where —you know, that’ s 
where we got into trouble before.  And that’s—it’s often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge.  We don’ t really see that now, so we take some 
solace from that.

Page 25 of 26 
 MYLES UDLAND.  Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.  Chair Powell, you referenced a 
minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn’ t have as much of when rates are 
low and inflation is low.  And I’m wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your 
move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come.  And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions?  Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So it doesn ’t play any part in my thinking and I’ ll tell you why.  
If you raise rates too quickly , you’re just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that’ s 
exactly what you don’t want to do.  So the best thing you can do, I think—I think the incentives actually run in the other direction.  If you’ re—if you ’re worried about going back to the lower 
bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate —that ’s likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower 
bound.  I think we’re far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced.  And so I think it’s more just—we ’re just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we—
how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent?  
MARK HAMRICK.  Mark Hamr ick with Bankrate.  You talked earlier about wage 
growth and your basic message to workers.  How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future?  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, we don’t—we don’t have the tools to control that.  
If companies choose to—companies in our system are free to do what they can—what they need 
June 13, 2018 Chairman Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 26 
 to do once they’ve—once they’ ve made profits and have cash to distribute.  They can distribute 
it to their shareholders, they can buy—either through dividends or through buybacks.  They can 
pay their workers.  You know, the part—and, you know, we don’t play a role in those decisions.  The part that we focus on is maximum employment.  That’s our mandate.  So we view maximum 
employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it ’s not so much that it 
will cause the economy to overheat.  And so I think we’ ve been committed to that.  I think we 
take that obligation very seriously.  And, you know, over time, when— when labor markets are 
strong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages.  But, again, we don’ t really have 
the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing.

Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference 
September 26, 2018 
CHAIRMAN POWELL: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks f or being here.  I am going 
to start with an overview of how  my colleagues and I see the ec onomy, what we decided today, 
and then a bit about our expecta tions for the months ahead. 
Our economy is strong. Growth is running at a healthy clip.  U nemployment is low, the 
number of people working is ri sing steadily, and wages are up. Inflation is low and stable. All 
of these are very good signs. Of co urse, that’s not to say tha t everything is perfect.  The benefits 
of this strong economy have not  reached all Americans.  Many of  our country’s economic 
challenges are beyond the scope of  the Fed, but my colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep 
the economy strong, healthy, and moving forward.  That is the b est way we can promote an 
environment in which every American has the opportunity to succ eed. 
Each time my colleagues and I meet, we face the same question: How can we set policy 
to best support job growth and low , steady inflation?  For many  years, this question called for 
very low interest rates to hel p an economy that had been damage d by the deep financial crisis 
that gripped the world 10 years ago.  As the economy has steadi ly gained strength, the Fed has 
been gradually returning interest rates closer to levels that a re normal in a healthy economy.  We 
took another step on that path toda y with a quarter-point incre ase in short-term interest rates.  
These rates remain low, and my c olleagues and I believe that th is gradual return to normal is 
helping to sustain this strong economy for the longer-run benef it of all Americans. 
As I mentioned, 10 years have now passed since the depths of th e financial crisis—a 
painful part of our history that cost many Americans their jobs , their homes, and, for some, their 
hopes and dreams.  In addition to holding interest rates low to  support the recovery, we have also 
taken many steps to make the financial system safer.  In partic ular, we’re holding the largest 
Page 1 of 29 
   
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
banks to much higher standards in  the amount of capital and liq uidity they hold and in the ways 
they assess and manage the risks  they take.  I am confident tha t the system today is stronger and 
in a far better position to suppor t the financial needs of households and businesses through good 
times and bad.  We continue to work to sustain these fundamental improvements while also 
ensuring that regulation is  both effective and efficient. 
Now, let me go into more detail a bout the developments that mot ivated today’s policy 
decision. Both household spending a nd business investment are expanding briskly, and the 
overall growth outlook remains favorable.  And several factors support this assessment:  Fiscal 
policy is boosting the econom y, ongoing job gains are raising i ncomes and confidence, and 
overall financial conditions remain accommodative.  These condi tions are consistent with our 
Summary of Economic Projections  for this meeting.  The median o f Committee participants’ 
projections for the growth of r eal GDP is 3.1 percent this year  and 2.5 percent next year. 
Job gains averaged 185,000 per month over the last three months , well above the pace 
needed in the longer run to provi de jobs for new entrants to th e labor force.  The unemployment 
rate stood at 3.9 percen t in August and has been near that leve l since April.  Smoothing through 
month-to-month variations, the la bor force participation rate r emains about where it was in late 
2013—a positive sign, given that the aging of our population is  putting downward pressure on 
participation. We expect the job market to remain strong.  And the median of Committee 
participants’ projections for the unemployment rate later this year is 3.7 percent and a bit lower 
than that in 2019. 
Overall consumer prices, as m easured by the price index for per sonal consumption 
expenditures (PCE inflation), increased 2.3 percent over the 12  months ending in July.  The core 
price index, which excludes the prices of energy and food and t ends to be a better indicator of 
Page 2 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
future inflation, rose 2 percent over the same period.  The FOM C seeks, and expects to see, 
inflation remaining near our 2 percent longer-run objective on a sustained basis.  At any given 
time, inflation may be somewhat above or below 2 percent.  For example, the recent rise in oil 
prices has pushed inflation a little above 2 percent, but we ex pect this to be transitory, as is 
reflected in our projections. The median projections for both the overall and core inflation 
measures remain very close to 2 pe rcent across the whole projection horizon. 
 Today the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage 
point, bringing it to 2 to 2¼ percen t.  This action reflects th e strength we see in the economy and 
is one more step in the process that we began almost three year s ago of gradually returning 
interest rates to more normal levels.  Looking ahead, today’s projections show gradual interest 
rate increases continuing roughly as foreseen in June.  The med ian of participants’ views on 
appropriate policy through 2020 are  unchanged since the June me eting. 
These projections play an impor tant role in our work.  My colle agues and I believe that 
it’s useful to communicate our v iews on likely prospects for th e economy and for policy.  We are 
well aware, however, that the ec onomy regularly surprises, and that even the most carefully 
constructed projections are high ly uncertain.  The projections about the appropriate path of 
policy assume that the economy evo lves broadly in line with the  projections for growth, 
employment, unemployment, and inflation.  If the economy were i nstead to falter , lower interest 
rates would be appropriate. Conve rsely, if inflationary pressu res were to rise more than 
expected, higher inte rest rates would be appropriate.  Right no w, as our statement indicates, risks 
to the economic outlook a ppear roughly balanced. 
Readers of the FOMC statement likely noted that the Committee d ropped a sentence that 
indicated that “the stance of m onetary policy remains accommodative.”  This change does not 
Page 3 of 29 
   
 
  September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
signal any change in the likely pa th of policy; instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line 
with our expectations.  We still expect, as our statement says,  “further gradual increases in the 
target range for the federal funds rate,” and this expectation is reflected in the  projections that I 
just discussed. Thanks very much.  I’m happy to take your ques tions. 
NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, 
given the lags of monetary pol icy, I want to know how you think  about ending the tightening 
cycle?  How will you know when to stop?  And do you need to kee p going until something in the 
economy breaks? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So the tight ening cycle, as you know, is a re flection of the 
strength of the economy.  And it’ s almost three years now that we’ve been gradually raising 
rates. And I think the fact tha t we have moved quite gradually , in a way, allows us to carefully 
watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial ma rkets to see how the economy is 
processing higher interest rat es.  And the fact that we’re movi ng so gradually—I think it—I think 
it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know,  we’re being able to raise rates 
and then wait and see how the econo my absorbs these rate increa ses.  And so far, the economy 
has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expec tations. 
JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times.   President Trump has 
stated publicly he’s not thrilled with the interest rate hikes.  His comments didn’t appear to have 
any impact on you or your colleagues.  Were his comments discussed at your meeting?  And do you have any concerns about the eff ect of these types of commen ts on the perception of the 
Fed’s independence and your monetary policy? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we’ve been gi ven a really important job to  do on behalf of 
the American people by Congress , and we’ve been given the tools  to do it, and my colleagues 
Page 4 of 29 
   
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission.  We consider the best thinking, the 
best theory, and the be st evidence.  We have  disparate points o f view, which we debate 
extensively and come to a perspe ctive and try to set monetary p olicy to achieve maximum 
employment in a context of pri ce stability.  That’s what we do.   We don’t consider political 
factors or things like that. A nd so that’s who we are, that’s what we do, and that’s just the way 
it’s always going to be for us. 
STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you 
explain how—the stock market be ing at a near all-time high, cor porate spreads being very 
tight—how does the level of the market factor into your decisio ns to raise interest rates?  Is there 
a concern on your part? And then, as sort of a second and rela ted part, can you tell us what 
happens in 2020 and 2021 that—I know you can’t tell us when you ’re shaking your head 
[laughter]—that prompts—that pr ompts you—the Fed to think that the rates need to still be 
above neutral in that time period?  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So in ter ms of financial markets and m onetary policy, 
we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the br oader economy, and they’re one 
of the many things that we tak e into account.  T he part of it t hat we control, though, is what we 
do with the federal funds rate a nd that has—that has effects ou t through, you know, out through 
the full interest rate curve a nd into financial asset prices ge nerally.  So the answer is, we take 
everything into account, but, you know, broader financial condi tions are just one of the things 
that we take into account. 
In terms of ’20 and ’21, why—your que stion was why the funds ra te needs to be above 
neutral?  So you’re right. Some  of—some of the participants have mostly very modest 
Page 5 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple—thre e years out.  You know, it’s far 
out into the future. I think it’ s hard to be confident that th at’s—that that’s t he way things are 
going to be. What we’re going to be  doing as we—as we go throu gh time is asking at every 
meeting whether monetary polic y is set to achieve our goals.  And I think that that’s an 
assessment of where policy will  need to be some years down the road, and I’ll leave it at that. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howar d Schneider with Reuters.  Cha ir Powell, I 
think—is this too good to be true?  Because you’ve got four years here of unemployment below 
4 percent—very low, substantiall y below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU—but no reaction 
of inflation there. And so I don’t think that’s ever happened since the 1960s.  Why do you think 
it’s going to happen now?  Or in the alternative, is this forec ast for unemployment just being 
driven by your confidence interva ls to the extent that, well, w e don’t know what else to do, so 
just extend the lie out—line out until something happens? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. No, you’re right .  The Committee forecasts wh at they—what 
they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains  in the high and middle 3s 
throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains ver y close to 2 percent.  That is what 
the forecast shows.  And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly  nonreactive to changes in slack— 
that is to say, a flat Phillips curve.  And it’s just—it’s a—it’s a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations.  And that’s not just our forecast, that ’s many forecasts.  So that is—that is 
—that is the forecast.  So you may ask—I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural 
rate of unemployment mean?  And s o that really is a longer-run concept that we think the 
economy will return to over the longer run.  But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn’t— it’s not creating problems in the  short run for that forecast. 
Page 6 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
Now let’s just admit that the i nflation process  has changed dra matically from where it 
was in the 1960s to where it is now.  It’s in a good place now.   We can’t take for granted that it 
will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course , watching carefu lly.  If inflation 
reacts more strongly or more weak ly to the strong economy, then  we’ll adjust policy 
appropriately. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I coul d follow up on that, what are you buying with interest 
rates? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, interes t rates, of course, have effects  on growth, have 
effects—I mean if—I guess the —your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest 
rates? The question is, what  would the economy look like if yo u didn’t raise ra tes?  It would 
look very different, I think, if we didn’t raise rates. 
We’re always trying to, you know, w ork our way between the—sort of the two—the two 
problems we face.  One is that  if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery 
unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent targe t.  Or if we move too slowly, we have 
an economy that can overheat.  So w e’re—that—that’s happened th rough history.  We don’t see 
any signs of that now, but we’re a lways trying to navigate betw een those two shoals.  And we 
think that gradually, you know, rai sing interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those 
risks seriously. 
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  The Fed 
has recently been saying that fin ancial stability risks are mod erate.  What kind of developments 
could prompt a change in that asse ssment to elevated risks?  And is there an argument for 
moving the countercyclical capita l buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting 
until the risks are seen as elevated, which, arguably, could be  too late?  Thanks.

 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I think one of  the most important lessons from the financial 
crisis is really the importan ce of the stability of the financi al system.  And so we—since the 
financial crisis, as you’re aw are, we’ve had a major focus on b uilding up our monitoring of 
financial conditions and financial  stability issues.  We’ve als o put in place many, many 
initiatives to strengthen the f inancial system through higher c apital and better re gulation, more 
transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, 
which are meant to strengthen the  financial system.  We’ve done many of those things, and we 
feel that the financial system is in a much better place. 
As we look at—as we look at conditions most recently—and this was at our last meeting, 
and it was in our minutes for the last meeting—quarterly, we ha ve a briefing at the FOMC, and 
also at the Board, of the staffs’  views on financial stability,  and the staff judged the overall 
vulnerabilities to be moderate .  If you dig into the different aspects of that que stion, households 
or balance sheets are in good sha pe.  You know, employment is h igh, wages are rising, that sort 
of thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, is—you know, muc h higher capital, much higher 
liquidity—is much stronger.  I f you look at asset prices, it is  true that some asset prices are in the 
upper range of their historical —upper reach of their historical ranges.  And then if you look at 
nonfinancial corporates, you get—th ere is the story of leverage there.  So it’s not that there aren’t 
any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate. 
Now, you ask about the countercyc lical capital buffer.  The cou ntercyclical capital buffer 
is a tool that we added to our  toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016.  We said that we would 
deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal.  We revisit that on a regular 
schedule, and the last time we r evisited it was, I think, last year—sometime last year—and 
concluded that the test was not  met.  As I mentioned at the las t briefing, the—you know, the 
Page 8 of 29 
   
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
assessment was that vulnerabili ties were moderate, but it remains a kit—a tool for our toolkit that 
we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate. 
SAM FLEMING.  Has the chance of  needing to deploy it increased? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. As I said, I think I’m in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as 
relatively moderate. I think the f inancial system—I think another thing that we learned in the 
crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabil ities as a long expansion continues.  I 
don’t see that in troubling—troubl ing amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it’s 
appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully. 
MARTY CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsi nger, Associated Press.  The researchers at the 
European Central Bank this wee k put out a paper saying that the  impact of a trade war on the 
U.S. could be dire, that the  U.S. economy could drop by 2 perce nt in the first year after a 
widespread trade war. Could you talk about the discussion you’ve had—your policy statement, 
does it mention the trade ten sions?  You did not mention them.  What do you—what kind of 
outlook do you have right now for the trade war? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So I gue ss I need to start by saying t hat we’re not 
responsible for trade polic y, and we don’t comment on particula r, you know, trade actions and 
that sort of thing.  But you will ha ve seen that we have this v ery extensive network of business 
contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we’ve been hearing a rising 
chorus of concerns from businesse s all over the country about d isruption of supply chains, 
materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that.  So we’ve been hearing 
quite a lot of that, and we—the Reserve Bank presidents talk ab out it in the meeting, and it goes 
in the minutes.  So we, you know, tha t’s—we’re very transparent  about hearing a ll that.  I think 
if you look at the aggregate perfor m—the performance of the U.S . economy at an aggregate—at 
Page 9 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
a national level, it’s hard to see much happening at this point.  And—or you can look at it the 
other way: You can ask, if all  of the tariffs that have been a nnounced are applied, what would be 
the effect at the aggregate le vel?  And they’re still relativel y small. 
You know, we worry about a couple of things.  One is loss of business confidence, which 
could reduce investment.  Agai n, we don’t really see effects th at we could measure yet.  Also, 
the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to une xpected trade developments.  More 
than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know.  If the— 
if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good , you know.  Trade generally 
supports productivity, supports higher incomes.  And, you know,  fair trade—fair trade under 
internationally accepted rules can be a good thing.  I think if  this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a 
place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for  a long time—a more 
protectionist world—that’s goi ng to be bad for the United States’ economy and for American 
workers, and families, and also for other economies. 
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  This is the third time 
this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts.  I’m w ondering if you could share a little 
bit about what’s causing that rise and whether you see supply-s ide effects coming through from 
the fiscal policy—fiscal stimulus yet.  Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it’s true. This year has—we’ve kept raisi ng our forecast for 
this year. This—as the year’s gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that’s a really good thing. And the  economy, as I mentioned at  the beginning, is strong, and 
there’s good reason to expect that to continue.  You ask why.  You know, some of it is, no doubt, 
the effect of the fiscal policy c hanges, the tax cuts, and the spending increases—that’s got to be 
part of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the 
Page 10 of 29 
   
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
oil patch. But, you know, the growt h picture is very much supported by very high readings of 
household confidence, business c onfidence, so it’s a—it’s a—it’ s a—it’s a pretty particularly 
bright moment, I think.  If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for 
the U.S. economy. 
HEATHER LONG. And the supply-side effects? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, supply- side effects, yeah.  So, you know,  we hope they’re 
huge, frankly. You know, the idea is, you cut—you reduce taxation on corporations and 
particularly—and allow faster expensing for investment.  The id ea is to encourage more 
investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes.  So t he effects are very uncertain,  they’re—you know, they’re—the 
literature is—it’s—there’s no cl ear answer to exactly how these  mechanisms work or how 
effective they are. And it w ould be soon to be seeing supply-s ide effects.  The other—supply-
side effects are probably both more uncertain and they’re proba bly slower to come in.  But, you 
know, as I said, we—I certainly hop e—I hope that we’ll be marki ng up our estimates of potential 
growth as well. 
CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News.  Taking a page  from your risk-
management approach in Jackson H ole, Mr. Chairman, I’m wonderin g if you can talk about what 
risks would make the Committee —plausible risks—go faster in 201 9.  What risks would make 
them go slower?  If you could talk about scenarios. And then I’d like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, poss ibly cutting rates to soft-land the 
economy?  I know the forecast doesn ’t show that, but I’m curiou s how you soft-land without 
doing that. 
Page 11 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so I thi nk I mentioned in the opening r emarks maybe 
something that addressed your question about what would make us  go faster and slower.  You 
know, the main thing where we mi ght need to move along a little  bit quicker would be if 
inflation—inflation s urprises to the upsid e.  We don’t see that.  We really don’t see that.  It’s not 
in our forecast, but any—so I woul d—I regard that as a risk.  I  think either a significant— 
significant—correction and lasting correction in financial mark ets or a slowing down in the 
economy that’s inconsistent wit h our forecast—those are the kin ds of things we’d react to. 
In terms of what, you know, what we would do—you know, I think we’re always going 
to be adjusting monetary policy to—in light of conditions on th e ground.  So if the economy is 
weakening, then it’s very possible we’d be—we’d be cutting rate s and, you know, vice versa.  
And so I can’t rule that out. I t—I think it’s  quite difficult,  though, to know what the effects— 
what the sort of end effects of  fiscal policy are going to be i n 2020.  It’s difficult to know what 
the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that f ar out.  So we have to make estimates, 
but we know that they’re highly uncertain. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawre nce from Fox Business.  Thank you , Chairman.  
The unemployment rate is now at  3.9 percent.  The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the 
past 12 months.  Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady.  The amount of job 
vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this 
year—where is the point at whic h, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment 
and the Federal Reserve should r eexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not 
to cool an expanding economy? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. You mean—you mean, where’s the point at which  inflation— 
unemployment is too low?  Y eah.  Yeah. You know, so we’ve been —I think the perform—labor 
Page 12 of 29 
   
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
force participation has surpri sed us on the upside.  There is a  long-run trend there, and we’ve 
now had basically five flat  years.  If you look—if you look at labor force participation, since the 
fourth quarter of ’13 till now, you really have a—kind of an oscillation that basically is a 
sideways movement in the face of  a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other 
factors. That’s a gain of well more than a percentage point in  participation, so that’s really— 
that’s really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining  in contact with the labor force 
and looking for jobs, finding jobs .  So that’s a great thing.  
And, by the way, it’s a signal. It’ s one of the things that ha s allowed the unemployment 
rate not to fall further. And it’ s a—it’s a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply 
side, that there may be more labo r supply than th e prior trend would indicate.  So it’s a very 
positive thing to see people staying in the labor force.  And, you know, we don’t know how long 
it can continue. We have models, and we look at this—we look a t this question all the time.  
And, you know, admittedly, we’ve been surprised on the positive  side here, so we’re open to the 
idea that that may continue or not. 
DONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair. Donna Bor ak with CNN.  Just to follow  up on the tariff 
question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven’t quite 
materialized—those weren’t your w ords verbat[im]—but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General 
Motors, Macy’s have all said that they expect the tariffs to af fect the prices of everyday 
consumer goods.  So my question is, when—should there be an eff ect—when would you expect 
to see that?  And at what point  do you start to become worried that it’s actual ly going to affect 
consumer spending and dampening economic growth? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. It’s a concern.  It’s a risk. You know, so y ou could see prices 
moving up. You don’t see it yet, but we—you could see retail p rices moving up.  The tariffs 
Page 13 of 29 
   
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
might provide a basis for companie s to raise prices in a world where they’ve been very reluctant 
to and unable to raise prices, whe re raising prices is really d ifficult, you know, with the ability to 
shop on the internet. This coul d provide, you know, a way for— again, we don’t see it in the 
numbers.  And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it’s h ard to say how one would react.  
And the other question would be, if you’re just talking about the effect on inflati on is, is it just a 
one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling  higher inflation going forward?  And 
that’s a real—that’s an importa nt question in, in how we would think about the appropriate 
response. 
DONNA BORAK. But is there a sens e of timing, in terms of when you might see that 
kick in, the effect of? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Don’t see it yet.  You know, don’t see it yet, but we—you’re 
hearing—I mean, broadly across the economy, it’s not just tarif fs.  You’re hearing—we’re 
hearing a lot of talk of labor s hortages, of material costs in particular industries.  We’re hearing a 
lot, you know, what amount to supply -side constraints and things like that, but we’re not seeing 
it. We’re seeing a sort of modest  increase in wages, inflation  right around 2 percent, no sense of 
it moving up really, so we’re not seeing it yet.  And, you know , we just aren’t, and we’re 
watching very carefully. 
MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.  
Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measu res that track that.  The flow of 
funds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in T reasuries.  So I’m wondering if 
that suggests a change in the wa y that tightening affects the e conomy.  And along those lines, 
you mentioned that you dropped the word “accommodative” doesn’t  suggest a change in policy.  
But if you’re dropping forward guidance in terms of “accommodat ive,” does the do t plot really 
Page 14 of 29 
   
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
serve any purpose anymore if , as you say, you can’t be confident out to 2021 what’s going to 
happen with the economy? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. A couple questions in there.  So the dot plot —I mean, I—it’s 
not new. I don’t think it’s a new point that forecasts two and  three out—two or three years out 
are fairly uncertain. The dot plot  is individual FOMC particip ants who are writing down their 
individual views on the evolu tion of the economy and of appropr iate monetary policy.  We don’t 
vote on that.  These are individual forecasts.  I think market participants generally find that 
interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. 
I think the point with “accommodative” was that its useful life  was over.  You know, we 
put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and  the idea was to provide assurance 
that we weren’t trying to slo w down the economy, but, in fact, we were still—interest rates were 
still going to be pushing to suppor t economic activity.  Well, that—you know, that purpose has 
been well served, and the language now doesn’t really say anyth ing that’s important to the way 
the Committee is thinking about policy going forward.  That’s w hy that came out.  Did I get— 
did I get all of your ques—? 
MICHAEL MCKEE. The idea that f inancial conditions remain loose  even though you 
raised rates 200 basis points? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, you know, it’s—if you look at a broad f inancial 
conditions index, that’s pretty m uch the answer you’ll get.  We  don’t control that, and, as I 
mentioned earlier, we do take fi nancial conditions into account in what we do.  And financial 
conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we’re taking them into account.  
But if you look at—look at interest rates, you know, interest r ates—look at long-term interest 
rates this year and short-term int erest rates this year, there’ s very significant increases.  And, you 
Page 15 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
know, with your long and variable lag s, that should be—that sho uld be having an effect over 
time. 
VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, V ictoria Guida with Politico.  So Nellie L iang was just put 
forward by President Donald Trum p to the Fed Board, and I was j ust curious, you know, given 
that she’s a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could spe ak to what role you played in, you 
know, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate.  And 
then also, if I—if I may follo w up on the financial stability d iscussion from earlier, you know, 
you’ve mentioned before that corpor ate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you 
know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on le veraged lending by making that 
guidance less of a—less of a cudgel, I guess, while—at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, 
completely under the control of  the White House and, ultimately , the President.  And 
traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I ’m happy to say that that has 
continued. But these are—these are really decisions for the Wh ite House, and, you know, we 
are—think of us as just being c onsulted.  I will say that I’m v ery happy and excited about the 
team that we’re putting together , and I’m very much looking forward to having those offices up 
and down our hall filled.  It’s b een pretty quiet, more quieter  than usual, which is saying 
something on the Board hall.  S o we’re looking forward to getti ng some people confirmed. 
In terms of corporate debt, so t his is a—this is a—you know, I was an investor for a long 
time in areas that were very clo se to the leveraged lending markets.  So, you know, I have had a 
lot of experience in that. That m arket has evolved really sign ificantly since before the crisis.  
And, you know, the banks take much l ess risk than they used to.  They’re—the—they’re 
Page 16 of 29 
   
 
  September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bon ds rather than keeping them on their 
balance sheet, to a much greater  degree.  But it’s also true—an d there’s significant research on 
this—that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending market s does have channels for 
affecting the real economy, if there’s overheating and that kin d of thing in those markets, so we 
monitor that carefully. You know , the guidance is —isn’t binding, as you pointed out, that the 
leveraged lending isn’t binding, a nd that’s just—that’s just th e way that the law is interpreted.  
So it’s something we’re monito ring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are 
moderate. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.   If I could come 
back to “accommodative,” do you think of policy as accommodativ e at present?  How close are 
you to neutrality, and do you share t he view of some of your co lleagues that you’ll eventually 
need to be restrictive? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so are we accommodative now?  So I thin k if you look at 
the—look at the dot plot in the S EP, you’ll see that the federa l funds rate, even after today’s 
move, is below the longer-run neu tral estimate of every single participant that—who submits a— 
an estimate of that.  So that’s why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you 
know, it’s perfectly clear that there can’t be a signal because, you know, by definition, that 
means an accommodative policy.  So it wasn’t because policy is not accommodative.  It is still 
accommodative.  The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it’s mor e that the language has run its 
useful life. 
There’s another point, th ough, too, which is, you know, we don’ t want to suggest either 
that we have this precise understanding of where “accommodative ” stops or suggest that that’s a 
really important point in our  thinking.  You know, what we’re g oing to be doing, assuming we 
Page 17 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
stay on this path, is, we’re going to be carefully monitoring i ncoming data from the financial 
markets and from the economy a nd asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals 
we want to achieve—you know, sustai n the economy, maximum emplo yment, stable prices.  
That’s the way we’re thinking about it, and that does kind of a mount to thinking less about one’s 
precise point estimate of the ne utral rate.  So that’s how I think about that. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  The second question was, do you think you’ re going to end 
up in a restrictive posture?  Gove rnor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you 
will need to do that. Do you agree with that? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. It’s possible. It’s very possible.  It happens often.  And, as I 
mentioned, many of the participan ts have written that down, and  they’ve written down really 
modest overshoots, you know, amoun ting to one rate hike kind of  thing, which wouldn’t have a 
big effect on the economy.  
You know, it—I would just say, you know, it really depends on w hat happens.  It 
depends on if we keep going—you can t hink of it different ways.   Maybe we’ve underestimated 
the neutral rate. Maybe we’ll  be raising our estimate of the n eutral rate and we’ ll just go to that, 
or maybe we’ll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or tw o rate increases beyond it.  I 
think it’s very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn’t really the question we’re  answering.  The 
question we’re answering is, how  do we provide the economy just the right amount of support— 
not too much, not too little—to susta in the recovery and achieve our statutory goals? 
GREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  Greg Robb from MarketWatc h.  The 10-year 
anniversary of the bankruptcy of  Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month.  I 
was wondering if you thought there w ere any lessons from the cr isis that you want to share—and 
two points on that. You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress.  Now, Secretary 
Page 18 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
Paulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Cong ress made a mistake when it 
took away the Fed’s emergency powers in Dodd-Frank. And then o ne other thing is that, are you 
confident that all these  nonbanks didn’t—you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know, 
the FSOC, you know, system.  So are you confident that the—you can see the risks in the 
financial system?  Thank you. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, three things there.  The first thing is the single biggest thing 
I think that we learned was th e—as I mentioned, I think, earlie r, the importance of maintaining 
the stability of the financial system.  So I think if you look— if you look back at the way the 
models worked and the way people thought about risk in the econ omy, that’s what was missing, 
and I think it’s not missing anymore.  So we—you know, we put a tremendous focus on that.  
We raised capital, liquidity. We  have stress tests, which force banks to understand—the largest 
banks particularly—to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to 
survive a really substantial shock that’s at least as bad as th e financial crisis.  And if all that 
doesn’t work, we’ve got resolution plans, which we’ve, you know , through many cycles, have 
made really substantial progre ss, more than I had thought was l ikely.  So we’ve done a lot. 
Nobody’s—you know, nobody is, I think, overc onfident that we’ve solved every problem.  And, 
you know, now we’re going back and kind of taking a hard look a t everything and, you know, 
trying to make—trying to—t rying to keep at it. 
So I think those are the rea lly important lessons, and, you know, we—we’re determined 
not to, you know, not to forget them .  And that’s, I think, a r isk now—is to—is to forget things 
that we—that we learned. That’ s just human nature over time. 
I saw the article you’re talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, 
emergency powers from the Fed?  S o there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under 
Page 19 of 29 
   
 
 
  
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
13, section 13(3), to provide s upport to individual nonbanks, w hich is really holding companies 
and other companies. In exchange for that, we got orderly liqu idation authority and a resolution 
authority. Was it a mistake?  I don’t think there’s any sense that Congress would seriously look 
at changing that. I have real  doubts about whether it was wise  to take away our crisis-fighting 
tools. I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but—and I certainly 
strongly oppose efforts to tak e away more of our tools. 
You know, the third thing you ment ioned is the designation powe r.  So it’s a really 
important power.  In my mind, it should be used—my thinking, it  should be used sparingly, and 
that means, you know, in situations where you have—I mean, in principle, you could have 
another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that’s not a bank, and it could be very 
threatening—or it could be capab le of creating systemic risk.  And so I think it’s a critical power 
to have. But, again, I would use it—I would tend to use it fairly sparingly. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Are you 
worried about the effect of risi ng interest rates on consumers? Credit card rates have jumped to 
more than 17 percent since the Fe d started raising interest rat es.  Mortgage rates are up. What do 
you say to consumers? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, we look—of  course, we look at that very  carefully, and 
interest rates are going up acro ss a broad range of consumer bo rrowing, as they would when we 
raise short-term interest ra tes.  They’re still quite low by hi storical levels.  And the other thing 
I’ll say is, take—if you take  housing, if you look at the NAR A ffordability Index, housing is still 
more affordable now than it was be fore the financial crisis.  S o you’re right that the cost of 
borrowing is going up, but it’s going up from what were extraor dinarily low levels, and it is 
Page 20 of 29 
   
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
something that we watch carefully.  You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very 
important channel through whic h interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects. 
HANNAH LANG. Hi , Hannah Lang, American Banker.  OCC’s decision to go at CRA 
alone suggests that there’s som e sort of disagreement among how  to proceed with a joint plan.  
What are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, at th e Fed, we are, you know, deeply co mmitted to the 
mission of CRA, which is for banks  to provide credit and other banking services in the 
communities they serve.  And we  have also been of the view for some time that with the 
evolution of technology particular ly and changes—changes in the  nature of banking, that it’s an 
appropriate time—it’s past an a ppropriate time, but now it’s ce rtainly an appropriate time to 
revisit the way we think about CRA.  But we don’t want to lose that focus on community, and, 
you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained.  Many of the 
issues that we had were reflect ed in the OCC’s ANPR, and we’re— we’re hopeful that, over time, 
there will be a joint proposed r ulemaking with the OCC, the FDI C, and the Fed.  It’s a process, 
and, you know, we’re very much interested in continuing to push it forward. 
STEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckner, f reelance journalist filing for NPR.  Mr. Chairman, 
following up on the neutral rate  issue—and you touched on this— but, you know, you and your 
colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral  funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but 
that’s still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it w as six years ago.  What are the odds 
that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor ma rket, other developments could 
further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the p rojected funds rate levels less 
restrictive than they now seem?

 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, in principle,  the—these starred variables—the long-run 
growth rate of the economy, the neutral ra te of interest, the n atural rate of unemployment—don’t 
move quickly. They move very gr adually.  They’re  pinned down b y longer-run forces, like 
demographics.  In the case of the funds rate, it’s more—it’s pr oductivity—it’s appetite for safe 
assets and demographics and other things, too.  So they move quite slowly through time. 
I think we all look at them—those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that 
every quarter and not make a cha nge every quarter but, every no w and again, make a change.  
And you’re right—we actually—t he median ticked up a tenth.  It’ s a tenth we’re talking about 
here, so—but still, I think it’ s a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the 
longer-run neutral rate and poten tially the longer-run growth r ate.  Who knows?  And maybe 
reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which  has been the trend.  It’s just that 
you change those estimates over time.  They’re informed by inco ming data.  They don’t change a 
lot, though, although they did—it’s interesting that  the neutra l rate changed quite sharply after 
the financial crisis in many di fferent models, and it’s been slow to recover.  I don’t expect a 
dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we—we’re so bad at fore casting productivity.  It’s just 
very hard to know when productiv ity is going to arrive and in w hat quantity.  So I think we have 
to be humble about how little we re ally know about where these starred value variables either are 
or are going. 
PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman.  Paul  Kiernan from Dow Jones Newsw ires.  Thank 
you for taking the question. I’d lik e to just kind of ask agai n—you mentioned earlier that 
gradual—a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react.  But, specifically, what are 
you going to be looking to see, because you’ve also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that may be we’ve reached the end of the 
Page 22 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
tightening cycle or where we s hould stop?  Secondly, if you wor ry about the divergence between 
interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a  time when emerging markets are 
under pressure. Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So, you know , some of the things that we’d be looking at 
to tell us whether we’re getti ng close to supply-side limits wo uld be, first, does job growth slow 
down?  A slowing down in job grow th would be an indicator, you know.  An unexpectedly sharp 
increase in wages or infla tion could tell you that you’re reach ing those points.  You know, if 
headline growth slowed down, that’ s another one.  So all of those things would be worth taking 
into consideration. 
I think also, though, we’ve seen s ometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we 
saw at the beginning of 2016, can ha ve a substantial effect pre tty quickly on our economy if it’s 
a broad and significant tight ening.  So we would be looking for  those kinds of things and many 
other things. 
So, in terms of divergence, yes.  So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is 
at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, heal thy labor market, inflation right 
on target, as I mentioned.  So—a nd we’ve seen growth abroad, bu t growth, I think, both in 
advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed do wn a little bit.  And in that 
world, you know, if the U.S. is stro nger, then that’s just part  of the context, part of the 
environment that could mean a  higher dollar.  It could be—it co uld therefore mean that some of 
our demand will wind up being shared with other economies.  That’s the way the integrated 
international economy works.  So you could see that, and, you k now, it’s just—it’ s just all of 
the—all things tha t go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy. 
Page 23 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
I would say, you know, we’re not res ponsible for the dollar.  O f course, the Treasury is 
responsible for managing the dol lar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it 
had in 2017. It’s moved up off its lows, but it’s not as high as it was at the beginning of last year 
yet by a significant margin. 
JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Mar ket News International.  Can  you give us an 
update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary pol icy that the Fed made earlier 
this year when it decoupled the i nterest on excess reserves rat e from the upper bound of the 
target range?  And have you bee n happy with that adjustment?  A nd do you see the need to make 
another such adjustment in the near future? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we’ve said that we would use our tools to assure that the 
federal funds rate trains—trade s within the target range.  And the principal tools we use have 
been interest on excess reserv es and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility.  So we—in 
June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on exce ss reserves by 20 basis points and 
raised the range by 25, and that move d federal funds sort of back into the range.  It worked, and 
it was successful. The federal  funds rate traded in the low 19 0s, well within the range. We 
may—we may do that again.  You know , we—again, we have our tools, and we will use them.  
We think it’s principally a f unction just of a number of things , but particularly high Treasury 
supply, and—which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well.  So we 
don’t see it as a—as a big problem.  We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and 
we’ll use them if we have to. 
COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman.  C ourtenay Brown from Axios.  L ast month, 
the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth.  Has  the Fed looked at th at at all, and 
what are you seeing in terms of non wage-based compensation? 
Page 24 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I wouldn’t co mment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine 
they probably wouldn’t comment on our stuff, either, but I woul d just say this.  So I am familiar 
with the question and the work. You know, we look—we look at a  range of indicators of wages, 
and I think the broader, the better.  You really—in a perfect—a perfect wage measure would also 
include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it’ s right to choose those broade r ones. 
But they’re kind of all telling the same story right now.  If y ou look at the principal four 
that we look at—we look at a w hole range of wage and benefit co st indicators—they are all now 
showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right?  Clu stered around 3 percent.  That’s 
a full percentage point higher th an it was five years ago.  Tha t’s a good thing.  Then the 
question—the other question is , what about inflation?  You know , if you’re—if you’re looking 
for real wage increases, you’ ve got to ask inflation, and there , you have to pick an inflation 
measure.  Some people pick CPI .  We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures 
because we think it’s a little better measure.  It’s a little b roader, and it tends to run a little bit 
lower as well, but that’s not w hy we pick it.  We just think it’s more accurate.  And that—the 
trend there is running around 2 perc ent, so if wages are runnin g at rough—wages and benefits 
running at roughly 3 percent and in flation running at around 2 percent.  PCE headline inflation is 
at 2.3 percent. PCE core is at a bout 2, and I think we see tha t, you know, the temporary increase 
in headline inflation as bei ng a function of oil prices probabl y, and we expect inflation to go back 
down to 2 percent. So we think of t hat as 2 percent.  That’s how we think about it.  Is that—I 
hope that helps. 
MYLES UDLAND. Myles Udland, Yahoo F inance.  Chair Powell, I wa nt to follow up 
on something you said, actually, at Ja ckson Hole.  You were talking about longer-te rm structural 
Page 25 of 29 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which 
has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. I’m just wondering if you could, you know,  maybe expand on your thoughts 
there and if this is an issue th at comes up among members of th e FOMC at all. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it doesn’t really come up.  It’s not reall y our job.  And we 
do—we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of 
thing. We don’t have responsibil ity for fiscal policy.  But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will 
have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have 
commented on fiscal policy. But the y’ve commented on—at a high  level rather than trying to 
get involved in particular , you know, particular measures.  And  so—and I—my plan is to kind of 
stick to the same appro ach and stay in our lane. 
And, you know—so I would just say, it’s—it’s no secret, it’s been true for a long time 
that with our uniquely expensive he alth-care delivery system and the aging of our population, 
we’ve been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and  there’s no hiding from it.  In the 
end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better.  And also, these are good times.  These are, you know, this is—this is the economy a t nearly full employment or in 
the range—in the neighborhood of f ull employment.  Interest rat es are low.  It’s a—it’s a good 
time to be addressing these thi ngs.  So I just—I put that out there and leave it at that. 
TAKESHI KAWANAMI. I’m Takeshi Kawanami from Nikkei newspaper. Thank you 
for taking my question. I’d like to ask about emerging markets.  What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emergi ng markets—interest rate, curr ency depreciation, or capital 
outflow from emerging countri es?  And do you think there is a p ossibility to stop t he interest rate 
hike due to emerging markets turmoil—due to turmoil in emerging  markets? 
Page 26 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sorr y, the second question was? 
TAKESHI KAWANAMI. There is a possibility to stop the . . . 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, to stop. TAKESHI KAWANAMI. . . . hike. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is a ssigned to us by 
Congress, and that is to have max imum employment and stable pri ces.  About half of global 
GDP is outside the United States,  and way more than half of the  growth is outside the United 
States and in emerging markets,  I should say.  And so the perfo rmance in the emerging market 
economies really, really matte rs to us in carrying out our dome stic mandate.  I’d also say that, 
you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying thi ngs and the economy is 
growing and our—you know, that’s going to support demand all around the globe, so that’s a 
good thing. 
Now, we do understand, though, that when we—when our economy is  strong and we’re 
raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates arou nd the world and can affect 
countries, particularly countries  that have significant externa l dollar borrowing.  And what we try 
to do is be very transparent a bout what we’re doing and why.  A nd we have been, I believe, and 
we’ve also moved quite gradually.  So I—you know, I think we’ve been performing well on that front. 
There are some countries that are—that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, 
and—but not most emerging market countries.  It’s a relatively small number, and those 
particular countries have,  you know, have particular vulnerabil ities, which are w ell known in the 
form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrow ings, and high inflation, and things 
like that. So, again, we’ll cont inue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we 
Page 27 of 29 
   
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
possibly can, and that’s really  the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth.  I’ll 
just—I think that answers both your questions, actually. 
VIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse.  Y ou mentioned 
earlier a possible, not probable , correction, and I want to com e back to the high level of the stock 
market.  Are there any participants to the FOMC to think that w e are witnessing an episode of 
irrational exuberance or rationa l exuberance?  And if there was a steep correction, would it 
provoke financial stability concerns? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I don’t comme nt on the appropriateness of the level of stock 
prices. I can say that by some valuation measures, they’re in the upper range of their historical 
value ranges. But, you know, I wouldn’ t want to—I wouldn’t want to speculate about what the 
consequences of a market corr ection should be.  You know, we would—we would look very 
carefully at the nature of it, a nd I mean, it—really—really what hurts is if consumers are 
borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value.  So that’s a 
really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly  levered consumers and housing 
values fall. And we know that that’s a really bad situation.  A simple drop in equity prices is— 
all by itself, doesn’t really have those features.  It could certainly feature—it could certainly 
affect consumption and have a ne gative effect on the economy, though. 
MARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chair man.  Mark Hamrick with Bank rate.com . 
One thing that’s changed since the crisis is, the majority of m ortgages issued last year came from 
so-called nonbank lenders, as trad itional banks scaled back.  W hat confidence do you have about 
supervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given  the role of housing finance in the 
crisis?  Thank you. 
Page 28 of 29 
   
 
 
 September 26, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. It’s a good que stion.  So you’re right that a  lot of mortgages are 
now originated outside the s ystem.  Many of those, though, have  to meet certain basic standards 
to be bought by the GSEs. I think we—if we look at mortgage cr edit more broadly, though, what 
we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with  high scores and with good credit— 
good credit records, and much, much  less available than it was before the crisis to people with 
low scores and perhaps troubled credit history. You know, it’s —have we—have we set—have 
we got that exactly right?  I  don’t know.  I mean, I—but that’s  clearly—that’s the reality.  In 
terms of those institutions, t hey do have supervision by the CF PB and other state regulators.  But 
you’re right. They’re much—much of the origination process has  moved outside the banking 
system, and it’s something we monitor.

Transcript of Chairman Powell’s Press Conference 
December 19, 2018 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Good afternoon, e veryone.  Thanks very much for being here 
today. [Cough] Pardon me.   
Over the past year the economy ha s been growing at a strong pac e, the unemployment 
rate has been near record lows , and inflation has been low and stable.  All of those things remain 
true today. Since the Septembe r meeting of the FOMC, however, some crosscurrents have 
emerged.  I’ll explain how my co lleagues and I are incorporatin g those crosscurrents into our 
judgments about the outlook and t he appropriate course of polic y. 
Since September, the U.S. econom y has continued to perform well , roughly in line with 
our expectations. The economy ha s been adding jobs at a pace t hat will continue bringing the 
unemployment rate down over time.  Wages have moved up for work ers across a wide range of 
occupations—a welcome developmen t.  Inflation has remained low and stable and is ending the 
year a bit more subdued than most had expected.  Although some American families and 
communities continue to struggle and some longer-term economic problems remain, the strong 
economy is benefiting many Americans. 
Despite this robust economic  backdrop and our expectation for h ealthy growth, we have 
seen developments that may signa l some softening relative to wh at we were expecting a few 
months ago. Growth in other econo mies around the world has mod erated somewhat over the 
course of 2018, albeit to still-solid  levels.  At the same time , financial market volatility has 
increased over the past couple of  months, and overall financial  conditions have tightened—that 
is, they have become le ss supportive of growth. 
In our view, these developments  have not fundamentally altered the outlook.  Most 
FOMC participants have, instead, m odestly lowered their growth and inflation forecasts for next 
Page 1 of 22 
 
  
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
year. The projections of Committ ee participants released today  show growth continuing at 
healthy levels, the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year, and infla tion remaining near 
2 percent. The projections also s how a modestly lower path for  the federal funds rate, which 
should support the economy and keep us near our goals.  As the economy struggled to recover 
from the financial crisis a nd the subsequent recession, the Com mittee held our policy rate near 
zero for seven years to give the economy the best chance to rec over.  And the economy did 
recover steadily, if slowly at times. 
Three years ago the Committee cam e to the view that the best wa y to achieve our 
mandate was to gradually move interest rates back to levels tha t are more normal in a healthy 
economy.  Today we raised our target range for the short-term i nterest rates by another 
¼ percentage point. As I’ve mentio ned, most of my colleagues e xpect the economy to continue 
to perform well in the coming year .  Many FOMC participants had  expected that economic 
conditions would likely call for about three more rate increase s in 2019.  We have brought that 
down a bit and now think it is more likely that the economy wil l grow in a way that will call for 
two interest rate increases  over the course of next year. 
We always emphasize that our po licy decisions are not on a pres et course and will change 
if the incoming data materiall y change the outlook.  And, given  recent developments, the 
statement notes that we “will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments 
and assess their implications  for the economic outlook.” 
Now I will provide some additiona l context and detail, starting with a review of policy 
over the last year.  Last December, the unemployment rate was 4 .1 percent, and inflation had 
been running just below 2 percen t.  FOMC participants and many other forecasters were 
predicting that grow th in 2018 would be strong.  This growth wa s predicted to push the 
Page 2 of 22 
 
  
 
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
unemployment rate down to near his toric lows, and the increasingly tight labor market was 
expected to help push i nflation up to 2 percent. 
Given this outlook, Committee members judged that the appropria te way to sustain the 
expansion with inflation near 2 pe rcent was to continue gradually withdrawing the extraordinary 
support for the economy that had been in place for almost 10 years.  Thus, in December 2017, 
the median of the projections of  FOMC participants pointed to t hree ¼ point interest rate 
increases in 2018, which would have left the target range for the federal funds rate at year-end at 
2 to 2¼ percent, still below most e stimates of the longer-run n ormal rate. 
Early in 2018, it became clear tha t the economy was likely to be even stronger than we 
had expected, in part because the  fiscal stimulus adopted near the start of the year was larger and 
more front-end loaded than most ha d anticipated.  The signs of a more robust economy proved 
accurate, and the FOMC has now rai sed rates four times this yea r, counting today’s action, one 
more time than anticipated in the median projection a year ago. 
This illustrates the nature of data dependence that we always e mphasize.  In 2018, the 
economy was somewhat more robust than expected, and this led to  a slightly faster pace of 
policy normalization than had been projected.  When the economy  has, instead, turned out 
weaker than expected, the Comm ittee has slowed or paused the pa ce of rate increases as we did 
in 2016. And when the economy has performed about as expected,  the Committee has generally 
moved in line with the med ian projection as we did in 2017. 
What kind of year will 2019 be?  We know that the economy may n ot be as kind to our 
forecasts next year as it was this year.  History attests that unforeseen events as the year unfolds 
may buffet the economy and call fo r more than a slight change f rom the policy projections 
released today. 
Page 3 of 22 
 
  
  December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
With that caveat, there are tw o important differences in the po licy outlook today versus 
next year. In early 2018, we saw a rising trajectory for growth; today, instead, we see growth 
moderating ahead. FOMC participants, along with many other forecasters, had long predicted 
some moderation of growth in 2019.  T he additional tightening o f financial conditions we have 
seen over the past couple of mont hs along with signs of somewha t weaker growth abroad have 
also led us to mark down growth a nd inflation projections a bit.  The median of FOMC 
participants’ projections show s growth of 3 percent this year a nd 2.3 percent in 2019.  With 
growth remaining next year above its longer-run normal value, the unemployment rate is 
projected to fall a bit furt her, to 3.5 percent by the end of 2 019.  Inflation in the median 
projection remains near 2 percent. 
Second, the economy has continued to strengthen this year.  And , given our four rate 
increases and the ongoing reduction in our portfolio, monetary policy will be providing a smaller 
boost to the economy in 2019.  After today’s action, the target range for the feder al funds rate is 
2¼ to 2½ percent, putting it at the lower end of the range of e stimates of the longer-run normal 
rate provided by the Committee. 
Over the next year, if events pl ay out broadly as expected, the federal funds rate will be 
in a range in which judgments  of people both inside and outside  the Fed will sometimes differ 
regarding whether the stance of policy is modestly accommodativ e, neutral, or modestly 
restrictive. When rates are in this range, the FOMC makes poli cy in light of the array of diverse 
views on the Committee.  Moving forward, my colleagues and I will be watching the economy 
closely for indications that th e stance of policy is appropriate to sustain the expansion with a 
strong labor market and i nflation near 2 percent. 
Page 4 of 22 
 
  
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
It is worth noting that the Summ ary of Economic Projections is a compilation of the 
individual projections of all FO MC participants.  We sometimes point to the median of these 
projections to illustrate the broad middle of views of the Committee.  Each participant’s 
projection represents appropr iate policy under the baseline out look—baseline outlook provided 
by that participant. We believe t hat the SEP provides useful i nformation about Committee 
participants’ thinking, but the me dian is not a consensus judgm ent and certainly does not 
represent a Committee plan.  Actual policy will, as always, be adjusted as incoming data shed 
light on the state of the ec onomy, the outlook, and the changin g balance of risks. 
Neither the pace nor the ultimate  destination of any further ra te increases is 
predetermined.  We will adjust monetary policy as best we can t o keep the expansion on track, 
the labor market strong, and inf lation near 2 percent.  We know  that our policy decisions affect 
all American families and businesses, and we’ll continue to mak e our decisions objectively and 
based solely on the best inf ormation and analysis.  Thank you, and I’ll be happy to take your 
questions. 
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  One of 
the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data.  I w onder, first of all, if you could explain 
why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we’re still not seeing much in the way 
of inflationary pressu res.  And in the context of a more data-d ependent Fed, how will the Fed 
respond to further undershoots of  inflation moving into next year?  Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, you’re rig ht, Sam.  Inflation has come in just a touch 
below where we expected it to be—not by a big amount, but by a small amount.  More broadly, 
2018 has been the strongest year since the recov—since the fina ncial crisis.  And during that 
period we’ve had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflat ion has still remained just a 
Page 5 of 22 
 
  
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
touch below 2 percent.  So I do thi nk that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving 
forward. As I mentioned, there’s  significant uncertainty about  the—both the path and the 
ultimate destination of any further rate increases. 
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Today, the Fed 
lowered its expectations for interest rate increases.  Given th at, I’m wondering if the Fed has had 
any discussion of altering the cour se of balance sheet normaliz ation and if you could give us any 
insight on what might lead the F OMC to alter that balance sheet  normalization in 2019. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. If you go b ack some years, I think we— people who were 
working at the Fed in 2013 and ’14 t ook away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive 
to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and 
things like that. So we thought carefully about this, on how t o normalize policy, and came to the 
view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on  automatic pilot and use 
monetary policy, rate policy, t o adjust to incoming data. 
And I think that has been a good decision.  I think that the ru noff of the balance sheet has 
been smooth and has served its purpose.  And I don’t see us changing that.  And I do think that 
we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate p olicy, as the active tool of 
monetary policy. 
NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chairman 
Powell, you talked a little bit ea rlier about the ability to be  patient.  And so as you think about 
your next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current r ecent pace to a slightly different 
destination that’s laid out i n the projections today?  Or does the current environment of 
restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few  moves and take more time to 
get there? 
Page 6 of 22 
 
  
 
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as background, I would just point to 2018  being a very 
strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still  having what amounts to a 
positive forecast.  We still are forecasting, individually, gro wth a bit above its longer-run 
potential—2.3 percent is what we’re forecasting.  We’re forecas ting that growth will be strong 
enough that unemployment will drop  still further and inflation will remain right near our target.  
So I’d say that’s a reasonably positive forecast. 
Going forward, you know, I will be l ooking, in particular, to see whether incoming data 
tell us that we’re, in fact, on tha t path, that development of the economy is in line with that 
expectation.  That will be the main thing.  More broadly, thoug h, I think we’ve reached the 
bottom end of the range of Comm ittee estimates of what might be  neutral.  I think, from this 
point forward, we’re going to be l etting the data speak to us a nd form the outlook and inform our 
understanding of what would be a ppropriate policy.  So there’s a fairly high degree of 
uncertainty about both the path a nd the ultimate destination of  any further increases. 
STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you t ell us how three 
things affected the outlook for t he economy and rates?  The fir st is how the market’s decline 
affected the outlook for the economy and for rates.  The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or 
how you factor that into your outlo ok.  And the third is commen ts by the President urging you 
not to hike rates. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as I menti oned, we monitor a broad range of economic 
conditions, including financial c onditions—a broad range of financial conditions.  And we took 
on board the tightening in financial conditions, which—not any one condition, but, broadly 
speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really.  So we took that on board in our forecast. Tha t’s why the forecast for gro wth and inflation went down a little 
Page 7 of 22 
 
  
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
bit. But, remember, that’s in a context of a more accommodativ e path.  So we also took down 
our rate forecast. So we defin itely did take that into account , and, as you can see from the 
statement language, we acknowledge d those risks in the clause a bout monitoring developments.  
And we’re going to be watching car efully to see as those things develop. 
I think, more broadly, there’s been a sense of concern among business people and market 
people about global growt h, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be 
partly about a variety of things .  If you just mechanically dro p into a model of the U.S. economy 
tariffs, you don’t see very large effects.  The large effects w ould have to come from financial 
market changes or from losses in business confidence.  And those are things that are very 
difficult to model. 
On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever 
in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy.  We’re a lways going to be focused on the 
mission that Congress has given us .  We have the tools to carry  it about.  We have the 
independence, which we think i s essential t o be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way.  And 
you know, we are—we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will 
deter us from doing what we t hink is the right thing to do. 
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times.  You’re about to 
undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year.  Your new forecasts say that you’re 
going to undershoot it for the ei ghth straight year.  Should we  interpret the dot plot as suggesting 
that some members of your Comm ittee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the 
end of next year?  If so, can you help us to understand why peo ple would be advocating 
restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation u ndershoots? 
Page 8 of 22 
 
  December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inf lation 
undershoots. And you’re right, infl ation has continued to surp rise to the downside—not by a lot, 
though. I think we’re very clo se to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it’s a symmetric 
goal for us. Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that ’s how we’re going to look at it.  
We’re not trying to be under 2 perc ent.  We’re trying to be sym metrically around 2 percent.  And 
I don’t—you know, I’ve never said t hat I feel like we’ve achiev ed that goal yet.  The only way to 
achieve inflation symmetricall y around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 
2 percent, and we’ve been close t o that but we haven’t gotten t here yet, and we have not declared 
victory on that.  So that remains to be accomplished. 
JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News.  Just foll owing up on 
Binya’s question—I guess if you have n’t achieved 2 percent infl ation and you don’t see an 
overshoot, which would be sort of  implied by a symmetrical targ et, what’s the point in raising 
rates again at all? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, again, I go back to the health of the eco nomy.  If you look 
at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial  crisis.  You’ve had growth well 
above trend. You’ve got unemploym ent dropping.  You’ve got inflation moving up to 2 percent.  
And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in t hat context, we think this move 
was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy. 
Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative.  It can  move to neutral.  It seems 
appropriate that it be neutral. We’re now at the bottom end of  the range of estimates of neutral.  
So that’s the basis upon which w e made the decision.  I also th ink we took on board, you know, 
the risks to that, and, you know, w e’re certainly cognizant of them. 
Page 9 of 22 
 
  December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairma n, Marty Crutsinger with the AP.  You’ve 
established for this coming year  a communicatio ns panel to look  at how the Fed communicates.  
Could you talk a little bit about  what you expect to get from t hat panel, and will the dot plot be 
involved in that at all? H ow do you think the dot plot is work ing?  Are we dealing with it the 
way that you want us to be handli ng the dot plot, or is it something that you mi ght tweak a bit? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So this review, w hat it really is—it’s coming  at a time when 
the economy is strong, and it’s a goo d time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our 
strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary p olicy are doing the job that 
Congress has assigned us to do on be half of the American people .  And what we’re going to do 
is, we’re going to open ourselves  up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all 
different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academi c conference in June in Chicago. 
And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, bett er ideas, old ideas—many of 
them have been around—and try to assess whether there are bette r ways we can do things.  One 
of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three 
decades now.  We may be in a worl d where interest rates are jus t lower for the time being, and, 
therefore, we’ll have less policy space to react to economic do wnturns.  And we’d want to be 
evaluating ideas for—again, for be tter achieving the goals that  Congress has given us. 
We’re not looking at law change s at all, and we’re not looking at changing t he inflation 
target, for example.  We are look ing for better ways to achieve  the inflation goal—for example, 
on a symmetric basis.  So that’s the sense of that. 
As I mentioned, on the dot plot—yo u asked about the dot plot.  I think the dot plot 
generally does provide useful in formation about the reaction fu nction of Committee 
participants—sometimes more usef ul than others, I’ll admit.  Bu t, in general, I think people sort 
Page 10 of 22 
 
  
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
of have it figured out and unders tand what it is  and what it is n’t.  But that doesn’t mean we don’t 
like to repeat what it isn’t, whi ch—it’s not a consensus foreca st.  It’s not something that we vote 
on. It’s something that each of  us writes down, and we always update it as—you know, as data 
come in and as we update our outlooks. 
MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee fr om Bloomberg Radio and Televisi on.  The 
balance sheet reduction—how much additi onal tightening do you t hink has come from that?  We 
know in the markets that the co st of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread 
widening—do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow 
the markets?  And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don’t adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we do watc h all of that, but the amount of —the amount of 
runoff that we’ve had so far is pretty small.  And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes.  So we 
don’t think, you know, things that are happening at the short run—at the short end—are driven 
by many other factors other than  the balance sheet runoff.  For  example, just—very large bill 
supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates .  Tightening of the federal funds 
rate has raised short-term  borrowing costs.  So, you know, we’r e alert to these issues.  We’re 
watching them carefully.  But we don’t see, you know, the balan ce sheet runoff as creating 
significant problems. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE. Hi, Edward Law rence, Fox Business Network.  T hank you, 
Mr. Chairman.  We’ve seen enorm ous volatility in the markets re cently.  We know the President 
said, you know, don’t raise interest rates.  It’s well documented.  The National Association of Realtors’ chief economist says t hat it’s starti ng to affect fir st-time homebuyers with the mortgage 
Page 11 of 22 
 
  
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
rates going up. When do you think t hese pauses need to come in  next year?  Do we need to keep 
this, as you say, gradual?  And then, in addition, what data ar e you specifically looking at for you 
that shows when the Federal Reser ve starts to become that headw ind in the economy with the 
rates? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we’re w atching—we have a strong forecast, 
generally, for next year. That  forecast involves growth, you k now, between 2 and 2½ percent.  It 
involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving un employment down and inflation 
near 2 percent. So that’s a pretty positive forecast.  So, to make further moves, I’ll be looking 
for data that suggests that tha t’s, in fact, the path that we’r e on. 
As I mentioned, once you—once you’re, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think 
it’s appropriate to be putting asi de individual estimates of that and be looking at what the 
incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might 
be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so—and 
letting that lead you to adjust  your outlook and, therefore, yo ur appropriate path for policy.  So 
that’s what we mean when we say w e’re “data dependent.”  Of cou rse, we’re always data 
dependent, but I think it has a  particular meaning in this cont ext, which is that. 
VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chair man.  I wanted to ask, first of a ll, whether you’re 
worried that President Trump’s tweeting and statements might in terfere with your ability to 
communicate with markets and w hy you’re doing what you’re doing.  And then, also, I was 
wondering if you could comment on—Governor Brainard gave a spee ch recently where she laid 
out the case for the countercyc lical capital buffer being activ ated.  Do you disagree with her 
analysis?  Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing? 
Page 12 of 22 
 
  
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. I’m not worri ed, because—about—on the first q uestion— 
because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that w e’re going to do our jobs the 
way we’ve always done them.  And that involves, you know, I thi nk getting the best thinking 
together, diverse perspectives. We—every business—every FOMC c ycle, we talk to hundreds of 
people in all different parts of  society, not just business peo ple or market people, but people from 
community development organizatio ns.  We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we 
really do have a pretty broad e xposure to what’s going on in all different parts of the country.  
And we’re going to take all that  information, and we’re going to make the best decisions we can, 
and nothing will cause us to deviate from that. 
In terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is—the countercyclical capita l buffer is a tool that 
allows us to build capital at a t ime when vulnerabilities—finan cial stability vulnerabilities—are 
meaningfully above normal.  And so that’s a tool I’d be absolut ely willing to use and happy to 
use at such time as that test is met.  We meet and discuss that  and evaluate it on roughly an 
annual basis. We haven’t done i t since early this year.  I think we’ll be doing it early next year, 
and we’ll be reaching that judgment then.  I will tell you, I r ecently gave a sp eech saying that I 
believe that financial stabili ty vulnerabilities were roughly a t a moderate level.  So, for me, 
that—but I would want to leav e open—my mind open on that and ha ve that discussion with my 
Board colleagues when the issue arises. 
ANN SAPHIR.  Ann Saphir with Reuters.  You said that policy doe s not need, at this 
point, to be accommodative.  But does it need to be restrictive , as the dots seem to suggest that it 
will be? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Does it current ly need to be restrictive?  No .  And I don’t 
believe that it is. I  don’t believe that po licy is restrictive . 
Page 13 of 22 
 
  
  
 
                                                 
    December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
ANN SAPHIR. Next year. The dots suggest it will be restrictiv e next year.  Should 
it be? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, I—I’ve di scussed this a couple of times .  It’s a very good 
question. And I guess I would just go back to this:  The indiv idual forecasts are not something 
that the Committee votes on. They’re out in the future.  We vote on the rate increase, and we 
write down our—you know, our own personal paths. So people hav e disparate views on what 
the endpoint could be. 
Ultimately, it’s going to depend on what the circumstances are.  There would be 
circumstances in which it w ould be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be 
circumstances in which it woul d be wholly inappropriate to do s o.  So I don’t—I wouldn’t put 
too much on—it does inform you, the  way people are thinking about things.  But don’t—I 
wouldn’t take it as a signal about current policy or about near -term policy. 
PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Paul Kiernan f rom Dow Jones Newswires.  Than ks for the 
question. In Dallas last mont h you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses, 
sometimes hearing things that aren’t yet showing up in the econ omic data.  And I was just 
wondering if you’re hearing anythin g from businesses that might  explain the recent market 
moves. You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn ’t showed up yet in the data? 
Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, if  you look at the Tealbook, or—you know,  we get the 
Tealbook in person from the Rese rve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their 
discussions not just with their directors, but with literally h undreds of business and nonprofit, 
you know, and labor union people around the country.1 And I personally find it really 
1 Chairman Powell was referring to the Beige Book, not the Tealb ook. 
Page 14 of 22 
 
  
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
interesting. My background is ve ry much working—starting with,  you know, a small group of 
people, maybe a company, and w orking out.  So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me 
capture the picture better. 
So—and, you know, what—what you’re  picking up now, I think, is,  there’s, you know, a 
mood of concern, or it’s a mood of angst about growth going for ward, if I could just capture it in 
one thought. There are many reasons  that are given for that, b ut, generally speaking, it’s—it’s a 
concern about, is growth going to be  as strong as it was?  Why not?  What might it be—to 
different people?  But that mood i s out there.  That doesn’t me an that it’ll come i nto the real data 
in a big way—it may, but—or that fi nancial conditions will tighten further.  We’ll just have to 
see. For now, financial conditions  have tightened a little bit .  We’ve taken t hat on board both in 
the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to —you know, to provide some 
accommodation to push back against that tightening.  That’s how  I think about it. 
GREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Just following up on P aul’s question— 
President Trump said recently that you should feel the markets.   So when you see the markets, 
you know, what are the markets telling you? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, financial conditions—broadly speaki ng, we don’t 
look at any one market.  We look at a really big range of finan cial conditions.  And what matters 
for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of  financial conditions that are 
sustained for a period of time .  A little bit of volatility—spe aking in the abstract—some volatility 
doesn’t probably leave a mar k on the economy.  So we look for that. 
And, you know, what we’ve seen here is a tighten ing.  There’s been a tightening since 
right around after—a week or so a fter the September meeting.  A nd, you know, that—we tried to 
factor that into our models of t he economy and to the results t hat come out of those models.  
Page 15 of 22 
 
  
 
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
That’s how we think about it. So we do, you know—we follow mar kets really carefully.  But, 
remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the  single dominant indicator 
and it really matters if changes are sustained over time. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER .  Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace.  Do you 
still think core PCE is a good m easure of whether the economy i s overheating?  What do you 
think of other measures like setting a target for economic grow th and relying more on that? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator.  
It has—what’s happened over, rea lly, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to 
changes in growth. There was a  time when inflation reacted rea lly quickly to changes in growth 
and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us.  And t hat is often attributed to the 
success of central banks in anchorin g inflation expectations so  that people believe that inflation 
will come back to the target or a round the target so it doesn’t  go down as much—inflation 
doesn’t go down as much in a  downturn and doesn’t go up as much  when the—you know, when 
the economy is strong. 
It’s really true, though, that infl ation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent 
unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment.  Now, it did move  up last year.  But in terms 
of just targeting growth, you know , I think—I actually think ou r dual mandate works very well, 
which is maximum employment and s table prices.  Most of the tim e, those two things work 
together. When they work temporar ily in different ways, we tak e a balanced approach.  But I 
think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it. 
DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, D onna Borak with CNN.  Next year, every 
meeting will be a live meeting.  S o, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the 
market anticipates when a rate  hike is coming.  How has the Com mittee thought through 
Page 16 of 22 
 
  December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
communicating those potential policy moves, especially in light  of the fact of the tremendous 
amount of uncertainty g oing into next year? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. I think having regular press conferences will  be a big gain for 
communication. I certainly hope it will.  That’s the plan.  An d so, being able to come out after 
each meeting and explain the Committee’s thinking and relate th at to the state of the economy 
and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it ’ll be—the idea is that it’ll be 
helpful in explaining how we ’re thinking and, you know, explain ing what we’re thinking about 
policy going forward. So that’s the plan.  I do believe it wil l be a positive development. 
I think it’ll also become the case, over time, that there will be no “prior” as to whether we 
would move at a quarterly mee ting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP.  As 
you know, we only update our projecti ons under the current appr oach quarterly, whereas we 
have eight—eight meetings.  So I think we’ll move to a more—we’ ll have the ability to move 
eight—at eight different meetings .  Not eight times, but at eig ht different meetings on the year. 
DONNA BORAK. I guess that’s sort  of the question that I’m tryi ng to drive at is, in 
terms of communicating to the market, because we’ve been—the ma rket’s been so adjusted to 
the fact that these are quar ter-end rate hikes, and now you hav e the potential to move eight times 
a year—is the Fed thinking thr ough how it’s going to communicat e when it plans, especially 
given the amount of uncertainty? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. I mean, I  think that’s probably pretty straightforward.  If 
we, you know—if we’re—if we want to communicate something about something that’s going to 
happen in a future meeting, I  think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, 
and such. 
Page 17 of 22 
 
  December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.   You mentioned broad-bas ed wage gains this 
year, and I’m wondering if you see further acceleration in wage  growth and just how much slack 
there is in the labor market. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So what we’ve se en is, is a very gradual—and, I think, 
ongoing—increase in wages. If  you go back a few years, you’ll see that we look at many, many 
indicators of wages and compens ation.  But there are four princ ipal ones.  And they were all kind 
of clustered around 2—if you go back five years ago—2 percent i ncrease per year.  Now they are 
all at 3, and they’ve just con tinued to gradually move up—not p erfectly in sync, but—and that’s 
a number that is, you know, right  in keeping with 2 percent inf lation and 1 percent productivity 
growth. So in an economic sense, it makes sense. 
I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage inc reases will continue, and 
that would be a welcome development.  Wage—wage increases do no t need to be inflationary.  
There’s plenty of evidence of situations—for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 
1990s of a—I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, w e had wage increases above 
productivity plus inflation, and w e didn’t have high inflation.  So it would be welcome.  We hear 
a great deal of anecdotal infor mation about labor shortages, al ong with other, you know, 
bottlenecks and things. So I woul d expect that wages will keep  moving up, and it doesn’t 
necessarily mean inflation.  We  don’t think of it that way.  So  did that answer your question? 
DON LEE.  Labor slack? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Labor s lack.  Yes. So, you know, by most ind icators—we look 
at a very wide range of indicator s on the labor market.  And, b y most indicators, we are at or 
even above longer-run normal levels.  But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, 
labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particu larly prime-age males, is still, 
Page 18 of 22 
 
  
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
you know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level.  Most other age groups in both genders have 
moved back up pretty close to where  they were at the last cycli cal peak.  You know, there’s a 
question, can we go above that cy clical peak?  And—or, or are the problems more structural than 
cyclical, and that there isn’t— so we’ll have to find that out.  I think, given the strong economy, 
we’ve had the luxury of finding out  that labor force participat ion can be higher than we had 
thought. And that’s not hing but a good thing. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker.  A regulatory question, if I 
may.  So, many of the Fed’s regul atory proposals so far, especi ally this year, have been primarily 
focused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range.  That is , a sort of tailoring enhanced 
prudential standards, particular ly for those banks, and I’m thi nking of the stress capital buffer as 
well as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion. 
G-SIBs and the largest banks s eem to be sort of left out in a l ot of these proposals, and 
I’m wondering if that is meant to s end a message that the Fed d oes not really intend to change its 
regulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if  you’ll get to that maybe later.  And 
I’m thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which  several members of Congress 
have sent letters to you asking you t o revisit and reconsider. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. So you’re right that a big focus of what we have been doing 
has been tailoring regulations.  And the sense of “tailoring” is that we want to look below the 
level of the G-SIBs at the l arge regionals and then on down to the community banks at various 
steps and ask whether we have appr opriately tailor ed regulation  and supervision to account for 
the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the 
economy and to the community shou ld they fail—should they exper ience material difficulty.  So, 
in the nature of that, you’re foc used more on the smaller insti tutions. 
Page 19 of 22 
 
  December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
I think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and s upervision to be effective 
and efficient. I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker 
rule. That’s something we ’re working on.  You know, we—we think that things need to be 
looked at carefully. And, again, I  wouldn’t want to materially  change capital levels, because, I 
think, you know, it’s important that the largest financial inst itutions, the largest and most 
complex—the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher 
expectations. And while we may tai lor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations 
are not going to change. 
STEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, f reelance financial journalist reporting for NPR, 
Chairman Powell.  I know you look at many different financial i ndicators, but let me focus your 
attention briefly on bond yields. T he 10-year note yield has g one down pretty steeply, roughly 
50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks.  I wonder what you m ake of it.  Is it a worrisome sign 
for you in terms of the outlook for  growth, for inflation?  On the other hand, could it be a 
positive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates a nd helping the housing sector? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. Again, we do focus on a broad range of financ ial indicators, 
and I—really, we don’t obsess about any particular one.  You kn ow, we look at a whole range of 
them, and we ask ourselves, what’ s really going on in the broad  picture out there?  You know, if 
you ask what’s going on with the l ong—certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has 
come in some.  That’s consis tent with, you know, a risk-off fee ling in the stock market as well.  
And, you know, we don’t know whether t hat’ll persis t.  Really, the longer Treasury has moved in 
a range above 3 percent and down 3 pe rcent as the risk sentimen t has changed.  You know, I 
think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of 
expectations of lower grow th.  But, you know, we don’t know tha t that’ll happen.  As I 
Page 20 of 22 
 
   
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
mentioned, our forecast for next year is—I think, in keeping with most other forecasts—is that 
we’ll still have solid growth ne xt year, declining unemployment , and a healthy economy. 
COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman, C ourtenay Brown from Axios.  I’ m wondering 
if you could clear up what’s become  a little bit of a debate in  the financial community.  You said 
in October in an interview with P BS that interest rates were a long way from neutral.  A month 
later you said interest rates we re just below neutral.  And I t hink a lot of people interpreted that 
as a shift in tone from you.  Were  they right to interpret it t hat way? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, monetar y policy is a forward-lookin g exercise, and 
I’m going to—I’m just going to stick  with that.  It’s—where we are right now is, we’re at the 
lower end of the range of neutra l.  We’ve arrived effectively a t the bottom end of that range.  
And, you know, there are implications of that.  For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there’s real uncertainty about the path—t he pace, rather, and the desti nation for further rate increases.  
And we’re going to be letting inco ming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path. 
MICHELLE FLEURY.  Michelle Fleury, BBC News. Chairman Powell, you talked 
about monitoring global developm ents.  I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute 
with China. But could you elabor ate on what economic developme nts you’re referring to, 
whether Brexit is one of those?  What else? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL. More broadly, I’m referring to global growth.   So, if you go 
back a year, 2017 was a year of  kind of ongoing upside surprise s in global growth.  It was the 
year of synchronized global growth.  And people raised their fo recasts for growth around the 
world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that  to continue into 2018.  What 
has happened instead has been a  modest retracing of that.  So you have still healthy levels of 
growth in the aggregate around the  world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the 
Page 21 of 22 
 
  
 
 December 19, 2018 Chairman Powe ll’s Press Conference FINAL 
global economy.  But you no longer ha ve the really strong level s of growth you had in 2017.  So 
that is one—that’s, I think, the key fact. 
We also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit—like, you kn ow, like the 
negotiations between Italy and t he EU over their budget.  And, you know, as far as those are 
concerned, we monitor them very carefully.  And I’m going to—I’ ll mention Brexit.  Our 
financial institutions have had a long time now to get ready fo r the full range of possible exits 
from the EU by the U.K.  And the y’ve had supervisory involvemen t from U.S. supervisors, from 
U.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors—we think they are fully p repared for the full range of 
outcomes that may come out of t hat.  I was very happy to see th e developments around central 
counterparties today. That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time 
being, resolved. So it’s somethi ng we’re watchi ng carefully.  Honestly, it shouldn’t have major 
implications for the United S tates, but, you know, there’s a lo t of uncertainty because it’s not 
something that’s happened befo re.  So we’ll be watching it carefully.  Thanks very much.

Page 1 of 24  Transcript of Chair man  Powell’s Press Conference  
January 30, 2019 
 
CHAIRMAN POWELL .  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.  I will start with a 
recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the 
judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet.  I will cover the 
decisions we made today as well as our ongoing discussions of matters on which we expect to 
make decisions in coming meetings.  
My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with 
a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.  The U.S. economy 
is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.  
The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with 
stronger wage gains.  Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal.  We continue to expect that the 
American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong 
pace of 2018.  We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time.  
Despite this positive outlook, over the  past few months we have seen some crosscurrents 
and conflicting signals about the outlook.  Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, 
particularly in China and Europe.  There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved 
government policy iss ues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the 
partial government shutdown in the United States.  Financial conditions tightened considerably 
late in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018.  An d, while 
most of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and 
consumer sentiment have moved lower, giving reason for caution.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 24  We always emphasize that our policies are data dependent.  In other words, as economic 
condit ions and the outlook evolve, we take that new information into account in setting our 
policies.  We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S. 
macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents.  At such times, 
common- sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity —an approach that 
has served policymakers well in the past.  With that in mind, I’d like to spell out how the Federal 
Open Market Committee has been thinking about these issues. 
At our December meeting, we noted the solid outlook for steady growth, vigorous job 
creation, and price stability.  We also stressed that the extent and timing of any rate increases 
were uncertain and would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook.  We therefore said 
that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and 
assessing their implications for the economic outlook. 
Today the FOMC decided that the cumulative effects of those developments over the last 
several months warrant a patient, wait- and-see approach regarding future policy changes.  In 
particular, our statement today says, “In light of global economic and financial developments and 
muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determin es what future adjustments 
to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.”  
This change was not driven by a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy.  
Like many forecasters, we still see “sustained expansion of economic activi ty, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation near . . . 2 percent” as the likeliest case.  But the crosscurrents I 
mentioned suggest the risk of a less  favorable outlook.  In addition, the case for raising rates has 
weakened somewhat.  The traditional  case for rate increases is to protect the economy from risks 
that arise when rates are too low for too long, particularly the risk of too- high inflation.  Over the 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 24  past few months, that risk appears to have diminished.  Inflation readings have been muted, and 
the recent drop in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation lower still in coming months.  
Further, as we noted in our postmeeting statement, while survey -based measures of inflation 
expectations have been stable, financial market measures of i nflation compensation have moved 
lower.  Similarly, the balance—the risk of financial imbalances appears to have receded, as a 
number of indicators that showed elevated levels of financial risk appetite last fall have moved 
closer to historical norms.  In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by 
being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy.  
Let me now turn to balance sheet normalization.  Over its past three meetings, the FOMC 
has held in- depth discussions on the final stages of this process.  Today we made some important 
progress in clarifying the path forward, as summarized in the Statement Regarding Monetary 
Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization that we released with today’s F OMC 
statement.  
The Committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our 
current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy.  That is, we will continue to use 
our administered rates to control the policy rate with an am ple supply of reserves so that active 
management of reserves is not required.  This is often called a “floor system” or an “abundant 
reserves system.”  Under the current set of operating procedures, as outlined in the 
implementation note released today, th is means that the federal funds rate, our active policy tool, 
is held within its target range by appropriately setting the Federal Reserve’s administered rates of 
interest on reserves, as well as the offer rate on the overnight reverse repo facility, without 
managing the supply of reserves actively.  As the minutes of our recent discussions have 
indicated, the FOMC strongly believes that this approach provides good control of short -term 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 24  money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effective tran smission of those rates to 
broader financial conditions. 
Settling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further 
questions regarding the remaining stages of balance sheet normalization.  The decision to retain 
our current operating procedure means that, after allowing for currency in circulation, the 
ultimate size of our balance sheet will be driven principally by financial institutions’ demand for 
reserves, plus a buffer so that fluctuations in reserve demand do not requir e us to make frequent 
sizable market interventions.  Estimates of the level of reserve demand are quite uncertain, but 
we know that this demand in the post -crisis environment is far larger than before.  Higher reserve 
holdings are an important part of the stronger liquidity position that financial institutions must 
now hold.  Moreover, based on surveys and market intelligence, current estimates of reserve 
demand are considerably higher than estimates of a year or so ago.  The implication is that the 
normali zation of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner, and with a larger balance 
sheet, than in previous estimates. 
In light of these estimates and the substantial progress we have made in reducing 
reserves, the Committee is now evaluating the appro priate timing for the end of balance sheet 
runoff.  This decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance 
sheet goals while minimizing risks to achieving our dual- mandate objectives and avoiding 
unnecessary market disrupti on.  We will be finalizing these plans at coming meetings.  
The process of balance sheet normalization is unprecedented.  Throughout this process 
we’ve attempted to lay out our plans well in advance, and we’ve been willing to make changes as 
we learn more about the process.  The implementation and normalization statement released 
today is intended to provide some additional clarity regarding the conditions under which we 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 24  might adjust our plans.  The statement makes three points:  First, as we’ve long emphasi zed, the 
federal funds rate is our active monetary policy tool. 
Second, as far as the particular details of normalization are concerned, we will not 
hesitate to make changes in light of economic and financial developments.  This does not mean 
that we would use the balance sheet as an active tool, but occasional changes could be warranted.  
Third, we repeat a sentence of the normalization principles we adopted in June of 2017.  
While the federal funds rate would remain our acti ve tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios, 
we recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy 
is not sufficient.  In those cases, the FOMC would be prepared to use its full range of tools, 
including balance  sheet policy.  
Times of economic uncertainty put a premium on the clarity and predictability of FOMC 
policy.  We are committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we’re  doing it, both 
regarding the path of rates and also regarding management of  the balance sheet.  We believe that 
this transparency is how we can best contribute to macroeconomic stability. 
Thank you. I ’ll be glad to take your questions.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So you’ ve said many times 
recently that policy was still accommodative and that it needn ’t be so.  You ’ve said recently that 
policy —the state of the policy was still accommodative and that the economy didn’ t require that 
anymore.  Is that still the case?  If so, how do you justify the removal of  the need for some 
further interest rate increases?  Basically, are we at neutral now , or does the economy still need 
accommodation?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now.  
We think our policy stance is appropriat e right now .  We do.  We also know that our policy rate 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 24  is now in the range of the Committee ’s estimates of neutral.  So we ’ll be—again, we think our 
policy stance is appropriate.  
HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Last week, the IMF said 
risks are clearly skewed to the downside for the U.S. and global economy.  Can you clarify —
does the FOMC see risks as skewed to the downside, particularly after you removed the 
statement about risk s being balanced?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the 
risks to the baseline , and the risks are , of course , the fact that financial conditions have tightened, 
that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let ’s say, government -related risks like Brexit 
and trade discussions , and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown.  So we 
looked at —we look at those , and the way we think of it is that policy —we will use our policy , 
and we have, to offset risks to the baseline.  So we view the baseline as still solid , and part of that 
is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks.  So that ’s the way we ’re thinking 
about that now. 
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks.   Sam Fleming from the Financial Times.  The Fed has linked 
its commitment to patie nce in part to subdued inflation outcomes.  Would you be comfortable 
with continuing patience even if there are modest, if transient, overshoots to the inflation target 
by core inflation?  How sensitive are you right now to developments in core inflation w hen 
determining the next move?  Thanks.  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is 
favorable , and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to —these risks —are going to be 
with us for a while.  We think our stance is appropriate.  We think there ’s no pressing need to 
change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 24  I would say that we ’ll be looking at a full range of data , and that will include inflation 
data.   It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum 
employment.  Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are —
we’re always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don’ t look at —we look at inflatio n equally on 
both sides.  So I can ’t get into specific hypotheticals , but I do believe that we have a symmetric 
objective , and I believe we’ ll act that way.  
RICHARD MILLER.  We learned from the last minutes  of the meeting that some of the 
tweaks you make t o the statement have a lot more portent than we thought.  In light of that, I ’m 
wondering if you can provide us with a “ decoder ring ” for this statement.  “ Adjustments ”—does 
that suggest the next move in interest rates is as likely to be up as down?  And w hen you twin “ in 
light of global economic and financial developments ” with “ muted inflation pressures, ” does that 
suggest you have to see both the cessation of these crosscurrents that you’ ve talked about and 
inflation moving up before you get off the dime , so to speak, and move?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Sorry —say again what the first question was ? 
RICHARD MILLER.  First question is, “ adjustments ”—is that meant to imply the next 
move is as most likely to be up as down?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Ye s.  I’m just going to say that the —it’ s going to depend 
entirely on the data.  We ’re not making a judgment.  We don’ t have a strong prior.   We will be —
we will patiently wait and let the data clarify.  Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be 
with us for a  while , and I think we ’ll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to —as they 
relate to the outlook for the U.S . and that will be an important aspect as well.  Your second 
question was?  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 24  RICHARD MILLER.   Would it be not just the cessation of those crosscurrents, but the 
end of these muted inflation pressures —are they both sort of things that are necessary for you to 
change this “ patient ” stance?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, it ’s really hard to speak about generalities.  We ’ll 
be looking at everything , but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures —you know, 
you would want —I would want to see a need for further rate increases , and, for me, a big part of 
that would be inflation.  It wouldn’ t be the only thing , but it would certainly be importa nt. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, did the Committee discuss 
an actual change to the runoff policy or the runoff schedule right now?   If so, is that under 
consideration right now , and when might we know?  The second thing is, I have to nail down this 
thing.  You guys, Fed folks, keep mentioning the “market average”  or the “market outlook”  for 
the size of the balance sheet.  Are you endorsing the market average, which is 3 ½ trillion?   And 
if you ’re not endorsing it, why do you keep mentioning it?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Okay.  So today I ’m here to talk about decisions and also 
discussions about decisions that haven’ t been made.  So we ’re talking about the latter thing, 
which is discussions , and so I can’t get ahead of where decisions are.  But so the Committee is —
what we ’re looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer -run 
goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct —
efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn’ t put our 
goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil.  So there are a lot of pieces to that , and 
we’ve learned over time that it ’s—when making these —when designing these plans, like , for 
example, the  original normalization plan, it’ s good to take your time.  Let the best ideas rise to 
the top.  Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you’ re really 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 24  comfortable with what you’ve got and when you feel you can communicate it clearly.  So I don’ t 
want to get ahead of that process today.  
But—so we ’ve discussed —there are a number of pieces to that puzzle.  There are several 
different pieces to them , and I think they ’re coming —and I’m very pleased with the progress that 
we’ve made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those 
discussions.  That ’s the first question.  I’m not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else ’s 
estimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today.  There are estimates out there, but 
I’m not at a point today where I ’m going to be giving out numbers on that.  But there are 
estimates , and I think they ’re consistent with what I said, broadly speaking.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  So, just to clarify —I’m sorry, you did discuss reducing the pace of 
the runoff?  That sounds like what you said, to  me. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL .  Yes, it’s —so, a gain, we haven’ t made any decisions.  There n o 
decisions have been made.  There are different pieces of the thing , and that is in the discussion as 
one of many pieces that is in the discussion.  A nd that was reflected in the last minutes, actually.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  Chairman 
Powell, I want to follow up on Steve ’s question.  The size of the balance sheet obviously matters 
a great deal , but, so, too, if you follow the arguments that were made when the Fed was 
purchasing these assets, does the duration of those holdings.  So once you are —once you reach 
the terminal level of reserves and you have to reinvest maturing mortgage -backed securities into 
Treasuries , it will matter a great deal , of course , where along the curve the Fed resumes those 
reinvestments.  
And so I wonder, what does your staff research show about the degree of accommodation 
that would be provided by either moving to the front end of the curve and holding or investing , 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 24  perhaps , in shorter maturity assets , versus the other approach that was identified in the December 
meeting minutes, which would be to si mply reflect issuance of the outstanding T reasury 
maturities?  And which approach do you think is more a ppropriate in the current environment ? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  These are great questions.  Let me say that the question of the 
ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one , and it ’s one 
that we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings.  It won ’t be 
the first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve.  We had 
discussions at one of the last two meetings on this , and we haven ’t come to a judgment on that .  
And, you know, I wouldn’ t comment beyond saying that we understand that ’s a key question, 
and there are, you know, there are issues to be decided.  There are benefits and costs to doing —
to taking different approaches , and I wouldn’ t want to prejudge them today.  
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Binya Appelbaum, New York Times .  I am struggling a 
little bit to understand what has changed since we sat here with you six weeks ago.  You ’ve said 
today that you think that inflation would be the reason that the Fed would need to continue 
raising rates.  Has the inflation outlook shifted that dramatically in the last six weeks?  Can you 
speak specifically to why you ’ve mo ved from a posture of saying we expect to keep raising rates 
this year to a posture of standing still?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I’d point to a couple of things.  First, the narrative of slowing 
global growth continues, if you will.  The incoming data have shown more of that.  We ’ve seen 
that both in China and in Western Europe, and so that ’s an important —that has important 
implications for us , and that story has —let ’s just say it continues.  
And, in addition— I mean, I think important —possibly less important now —probably 
less important now , but—has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first -
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 24  quarter GDP.  We don’ t know the ultimate resolution of it.  If that ’s all there is , and the 
shutdown is gone and there isn’ t another shutdown, then we ’ll get most of that back in the 
second period—second quarter.  
So those things —in addition, you know, you have to look back.  Financial conditions 
began to tighten in the fourth quarter .  And they now have persisted and remain tight er—
significantly tighter, let ’s say —than they were , and that ’s something that we have to take into 
account as well.  So that ’s where we are.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  You said 
you like to be a plain speaker , so let me try to have you put this as plainly as possible.  Is it fair to 
characterize this as not a pause in a tightening cycle, but the end of the tightening cycle now —a 
new regime for the Fed?  And , if not, can you put a time frame on “patient ”?  Does “ patient ” 
have some sort of time frame?  And I ’m wondering about your reaction to the criticism you got 
on your December 19th news conference, your later statements —do you feel you’ve put a 
“Powell put” into the markets ? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So , patience— I think we ’re going to know in hindsight , 
because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its 
implications for the outlook.  So that ’s going to be —so it’ s hard to say, you know, it’ s hard to 
think of what to call it a t this point or how to label it.  
So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions.  
And I would say this :  We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two 
things.  You know, it’ s interest rates, it’ s risk spreads, it’ s currency, it’ s the stock market, it’ s 
credit availability, it’ s many, many factors.  And what matters for financial conditions is , when 
there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 24  importa nt for us because they have important macroeconomic implications.  So that ’s how we 
think about it.  
So we don’ t react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets.  But 
when we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that ’s something that has to play 
into our thinking.  In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions , so it’ s sort of 
the essence of what we do.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I just wanted to ask, first of all , 
about whether t he Fed is gathering information about some of the new money  laundering 
information that ’s come out about Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank and whether you have any 
concerns there?  And then, also, I was just wondering if you could say whether there’ s any kind 
of timeline on when the Fed might make a decision on real -time payments and whether you’re 
going to build a real -time payment system?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.   Right.  So, on the first question, I can —we don’ t comment on 
individual investigations or whether they ’re happening.  I will say that we take our enforcement 
powers very seriously , and we put them to work when we feel it’ s justified.  
In terms of real -time payments, it’ s something we ’re very actively working on.  As you 
obviously know, we have some proposals  out, and we’re considering them.  You know, the thing 
is, it’s very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and 
interest groups, consumer groups , and we ’ve done that, as I’m sure you know, over a period of 
years.  We don’ t have plenary authority to just do things , for the most part , in the payment space.  
We’ve been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public —public interest groups —and  
all those groups around the table.  And we’ve— I think we ’ve played a constructive role in that 
respect , and I believe that will continue.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 24  JIM PUZZANGHERA.  Thanks.  Jim Puzzanghera with the L .A. Times .  You and your 
colleagues may have noticed, President Trump, for the past six months, has been urging the Fed 
not to raise r ates—to stop raising rates.  How would you respond to those who would suggest 
that the Fed just caved to the president ’s demands?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So what we care about —and , really, the only thing we care 
about at the Fed —is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately.  So 
that’s very strongly our culture.  I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the 
Fed would recognize that description.  So we ’re always going to do what we think is the right 
thing.  We ’re never go ing to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of 
our work.  You know, we’re human.  We make mistakes .  But we ’re not going to make mistakes 
of character or integrity.  And I would want the public to know that , and I would want them to 
see that in our actions. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from F ox Business News.  Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.  The long -term federal funds rate is 2.8 percent.  I’ve talked the last year with a 
number of Fed presidents who worry that under 3 percent is not enough to handle the next 
recession.  You say that ’s your first tool , that’s your primary means of adjusting monetary 
policy.  So with a larger balance sheet —with a larger balance sheet, could you —how could you 
handle that next re cession , then , with the combination of those two?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.   I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a 
situation in the future —we hope not , but—we could be in a situation where we ’d like to cut rates 
more than we can effectively , and we hit the zero lower bound.  We don’ t think anything like 
that is in the cards.  Now,  there’ s no reason to think that it would be.  But as we said in today ’s 
release, if that happens, then we ’ll use the full range of our tools , and that includes the balance 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 24  sheet.  But we would use it after using our conventional tools, which would be the interest rate 
and forward guidance about the interest rate.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Even if you have a large balance sheet —$4 trillion?   Above 
$4 trillion?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Yes.  There would be room to do substantially more.  
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  I just wanted to go back 
to—you had mentioned on the crosscurrents, the government shutdown issue.  You mentioned a 
couple of weeks ago that that information would clearly show up in the data.  I’m wondering, as 
you guys discussed during this week ’s meeting, what the potential economic impact would be of 
the shutdown, the possibility of a second one, whether or not it would dim inish consumer 
confidence, have some severe ripple effects ?  Just talking to other folks outside, businesses —
clearly they were suffering and seeing a lot of pain.  I’m just wondering about , for American 
families that missed two paychecks, how is this going  to play  out for them for the months 
to come?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Right.  So let me give you the economic side of it  first—is that, 
even with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that ’s the end of it and everyone gets their 
backpay —except the contractors, I guess, the private- sector contractors , but—some people get 
their backpay , then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter.  So that’s that.  I would 
say that the —you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go 
through.  I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I’m, you know, really 
grateful they did.  I mean, to be doing your work while you’re not getting paid, it’s something we 
should all be grateful for.   Did that answer both your questions?  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 24  DONNA BORAK.  Yes, it does.  So you don’t see a permanent effect of this shutdown?  
And I’m just wondering if you’re thinking about the path of future policy and the possibility of 
reaching this point again on February 15?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So would there be a p ermanent effect?  As I mentioned, there 
wouldn’ t be if there isn ’t another shutdown.  If there were going to be a permanent effect or a 
lasting effect, let ’s say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and 
that would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the 
United States.  That would be the channel.  And I think that was something that we and many 
others were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown.  In terms of ideas for 
not having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those , so I think that 
could be a profitable thing to explore.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger, AP.  The Beige Book that was prepared for 
this mee ting noted a rising concern among business contacts about higher trade tariffs and the 
tensions there.  Did that play a part in the discussion and the decision that you made on shifting 
the wording i n your statement?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So , trade— you sound l ike you’re an avid reader of the Beige 
Book, and that ’s great —the trade, as you will know , then —trade has been a big feature in the 
Beige Book for some time now.  The Beige Book is a collection of all of our —of the comments 
that our Reserve Bank presidents  get from their D istricts.  It’s incredibly valuable , because 
you’re getting actual reports from people who are on the line.  And there have been real concerns 
about trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retal iation 
and that kind of thing.  So that ’s been a concern.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 24  I would say the longer -term concern , though, is the negotiations that are going on.  If they 
linger, then there could be more and more uncertainty , and you worry over time that that could 
have an effect on business confidence.  So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied 
both here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China.  So 
the concern is more a longer —for me —a longer , drawn -out set of negotiations back and forth, 
which could result in sapping business confidence.  Uncertainty is not the friend of business.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  I’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.   I 
want to talk to  you about corporate debt.  Are you worried that by taking a pause in raising 
interest rates —we ’ve had low interest rates for so long —are you contributing to a bubble in 
corporate debt?  
CHAIRMAN  POWELL.  So , we did —we ’ve called out corporate debt as a risk —more 
of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, t he sense of that being that if you 
have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they ’re going to be less 
able to weather that and keep serving their customers  and, you know, may have to do layoffs and 
things like that.  So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn.  So we watch that.  
We also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies.   In 
other words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans.  The question is, what is their exposure?  
Do they retain big pieces of the loans?  Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build 
up in a pipeline?  So we monitor those risks very carefully.  And, frankly, the banks monitor 
them much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis.   So it’ s a concern.  
It’s something that we ’re watching.   Of course, you know, November, December, and January 
were much slower months for those sorts of things.  But , you know, it’ ll be something that we ’re 
always paying close attention to.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 24  GREG ROBB.  Chairman Powell, Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Financial markets 
have reacted strongly to the decision and the press conference.  The Dow Jones i ndustrial 
average is up more than, like, 500 points.  There’ s a sense in the market that there’ s, you know, 
what people call the “ Powell put ” on the markets.   Are financial markets wrong in that 
assessment?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, I would point to all the continuity here.   You know, 
the thing we did on the balance sheet is something we ’ve been working on for, frankly, years —
the thing we announced today.  And so we ’re providing clarity there.  I think that ’s a 
constructive thing to do.  
My—honestly —only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the 
American people—that ’s it.  And this situation, I think, calls for patience —I think it does.  And 
it’s just the stance of policy we think is appropriate.  We see these uncertainties , and we see a 
time wh en we can afford to —we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch , and that ’s 
what we ’re planning to do.  And I think it’ s the right thing .  I feel strongly that it is.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Chairman Powell, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last  
year completed its f intech c harter .  And one of the questions around that charter has been 
whether the Federal Reserve will allow such a chartered bank to access the payment system.  I’m 
curious if you think a f intech c harter is a good idea in general , and what conditions you think 
might be necessary to allow the Fed to allow such a chartered institution access to the payment 
system.  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I’m not going to be able to help you much on that.  Those are 
great questions , and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are 
looking at.  I think we ’re open to these ideas , but I don’ t have any news for you on that today.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 24  STEVE BECKNER.  Thank you.  Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR.  
Mr. Chairman, you’ve echoed the widespread concern about slowing growth in China and 
elsewhere in the world , but I wonder whether it’ s possible that slower growth abroad might 
actually be beneficial to this country , in some respects , at least —for example, perhaps increasin g 
capital inflows and putting downward pressure on long -term rates in this country, as happened in 
the Asian financial crisis in the late  ’90s. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  You know, Steve, it’ s certainly possible.  Ultimately , though, 
you know, a strong global economy is good for us.  We export to these countries.  We trade with 
these countries.  I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept 
coming in stronger and stronger , and that meant the euro was strong , and that supported our 
exports.  So , ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point 
to an interesting case.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Chairman Powell, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  Thank you.  As 
you probably heard, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that federal debt is expected 
to surge to about $29 trillion over the next 10 years, reaching the highest share since the end of 
World War II.  First of all, does that sound like it could be a reasonable forecast, with the 
Administration seeming to take plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy of CBO?  And 
then, secondly, what effect does that have on interest rates and the public if indeed that ’s even 
close to being true?  
CHAIRM AN POWELL.  So , first, it is important —we don’ t do fiscal policy.  We don’ t 
advise the government or Congress on fiscal policy , so I’ll limit myself to more high -level 
comments and say that it is not a secret—it is a long -known fact that the U.S. federal g overnment 
budget is on an unsustainable path, and that needs to be addressed.  And that is driven principally 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 24  by the combination of health- care costs —really , due to our health- care delivery system —and the 
aging of the population.  And there’ s no time like now—when the economy is healthy, growing, 
people are working —to go after that problem.  Ultimately, we will have to.  We don’ t have a 
forecast.  We don’ t forecast those things.  I have no reason to doubt CBO ’s numbers on this.  I 
haven ’t actually looked at  that report , but my general experience with them is that it’ s a 
professional outfit. 
MARK HAMRICK.  What does that look like , if that really takes place 10 years down 
the road?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So, you know, first of all, our —the work that we do relates 
more to the medium term rather than the long term.  And so I don ’t see this , in particular , as a 
threat to this business cycle or to the economy this year.  It’s more in the longer run, we ’ll be 
spending all of our money on paying interest and not on the t hings that we really need to be 
doing for future generations and for our own generation.  So it’ s a serious problem , but it’ s not a 
problem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today.  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman.  Paul  Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.   I know 
where the FOMC participants ’ estimates for the long -run interest rate are.  They ’re all above 
2½ percent.  Right now we’re between 2.25 and 2½.  So I think a key question right now is, is 
policy accommodative at this moment?   Are we looking at staying accommodative for some 
time, or has your estimate of neutral come down, in light of the recent volatility in markets?  
Thanks. 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at 
2½ percent , and th at’s kind of roughly where we currently are.  And as I ’ve said a couple of 
times, when you get to that range —you know that we can ’t directly observe the neutral rate.  We 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 24  only know it by its works.  And so we have to put aside our own priors of what that r ate might be 
and let the data speak to us.  So we can do that.  We’re in the range.  There are a number of 
Committee members who are, you know, right around that range.  And I think we ’re watching 
to see. 
We don’ t—I don’t —again, I think that our policy sta nce today is appropriate for the state 
of the economy.  That ’s my feeling.  We’ re going to be watching data to see whether that ’s right , 
and we ’re also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and 
how the U.S. economy performs this year.  
VIRGINIE MONTET.  Thank you.  Virginie  Montet with Agence France -Presse.  
Among the global developments that the Fed is monitoring, how much of a risk for the American 
expansion would be the prospect of a “hard” Brexit?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.   So we ’ve been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully 
for a long time.   And for us, that starts with U.S. financial institutions that have a presence either 
in the U .K. or in the EU or both.  So we have worked with those institutions alongside U .K. and 
EU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and have liquidity and have all of 
the things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes.  So we ’ve done a lot of 
work on that , and, generally speaking —again, a lot of w ork has been done —we have to be 
humble and say that this is an unprecedented event.  But that ’s the financial system aspect of it.  
If there is a hard Brexit, then that would very likely involve disruptions both to the 
continental economy and certainly to t he U .K. economy , and we would feel that.  The question 
for us —it wouldn’ t be a huge first -order thing, the economic effects, unless you saw financial 
disruptions.  So , if you saw financial turmoil and that kind of thing, that would be the way it 
would reach us.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 24  I would expect that we would feel some of this , and it’ s very hard to have great 
confidence that you know what that would be .  But it would be something —probably  not 
material to our economy , but it’ s something we ’ll be watching very carefully and certainly 
hoping that there is a resolution short of a hard Brexit.  
JEAN YUNG.   Hi, I’m Jean Yung with Market News.   I have a question about the 
ultimate size of the bala nce sheet.  How will the Fed judge what is a reasonable level for 
financial institution s’ demand for reserves when it appears to be rising at a fast pace over the past 
year and perhaps at a faster pace than can be explained by regulatory changes during that same 
time frame?  Would you prefer to err on the side of being more generous, or would you try to 
encourage banks from holding —to hold less reserves?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Let me be clear .  I don ’t know that demand for reserves has 
risen over the past years.   I think our understanding of demand for reserves —remember that the 
banks have more reserves th an they need.  Reserves are still quite abundant.  
So the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end 
after, you know, after t he firms adjust to our very gradual decrease?  And so our understanding , 
really , of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past 
year.  And then there would be a buffer on top of that.  And then we would want to be —we  
would want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in 
an abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates. 
If you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these 
big, ongoing interventions in the market.  We don’ t want the Fed to have a, you know, a large 
ongoing presence in the market around this.  We ’d rather just, you know —in managing the 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 24  federal funds rate, we ’d rather have it set by our administered rate s.  So that implies you’d want 
to be a bit above what that equilibrium demand for reserves is.  
And, again, there’ s no cookbook here, there ’s no playbook.  No one really knows.  The 
only way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligen ce and then, 
ultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully.  
JEAN YUNG.  But do you take the survey result s as given , or do you try to encourage 
banks from holding a [inaudible ]? 
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  We don’ t take— you know, we don’ t think we have a precise 
understanding of this at all.  I want to be clear about that.   These estimates are fairly uncertain.  
So if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here  [gesturing with hands together, in the 
middle] , all you can say is , it’s probably somewhere in this range  [gesturing with hands apart, 
equidistant from the middle] . 
If banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason— which is to say , to hold 
liquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio , to meet their resolution 
requirements and resolution planning —we ’re not going to discourage them from holding them.  
They are , in fact , a very safe asset —in a way, the safest asset.  And we want the banks to be safe 
and sound. 
We didn’ t create the reserv es, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since —in the 
post-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand- new and quite substantial liquidity 
requirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit.  So it’ s not a bad thing 
that ba nks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset.  We don’ t—we ’re not encouraging 
them to hold reserves inste ad of T reasuries .  Treasuries or reserves  are roughly equivalent for 
this purpose. 
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 24  COURTENAY BROWN.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.   A data-
dependency question:  H as there been a prioritization of market data over the economic data?   
How do you balance those two things?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.  I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum 
employment and stable prices , and that ’s about, you know, hard, real -side economic data.  We —
as I mentioned earlier, we —our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy 
through financial conditions.  So financial conditions matter , and they matter in the way that I 
suggested ear lier—which is to say , broad financial conditions changing over a sustained 
period—that has implications for the macroeconomy .  It does.  So if you lower interest rates and 
they stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate.  That ’ll have an 
effect on —over time , an effect on the economy.  But, again, the entire focus we have is on 
maximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial 
conditions generally.  
MYLES UDLAND.  Chairman Powell, Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance.   I would just 
ask, I guess, about the balance sheet in general .  And are you surprised at how much of a 
conversation we ’re having around the balance sheet , and how much talk about the balance sheet 
from you rself and various Fed official s have moved financial markets?  Because putting out a 
statement, clarifying your view on the balance sheet, you know, is somewhat surprising, 
considering it is restating, you know, what the Fed had said all along was the goal  with balance 
sheet normalization —to roll it off, not have it be a key part of policy.  And so I would just ask, 
are you surprised by how far that conversation has gotten just in the last six weeks?  
CHAIRMAN POWELL.   You know, I’ll quickly go back—in 2017, we were—in 
designing the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy.  
January 30, 2019  Chairman Powell’s Press C onference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 24  We learned during the taper tantrum, frankly, in 2013 that was —that would be confusing to 
markets.  So what we did was we set up the normalization of  the balance sheet in a way that was 
very transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to T reasuries , pretty much 
the exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands.  
And we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced  in and 
understood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have inter est rates be 
the active tool of  policy.  
So that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one 
for our policy and for the benefit of the country.  I think that there’s —I think  the market is now 
looking for more clarity around that , and I think we’ll be providing it.  That ’s what ’s happened.  
Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
March 2 0, 2019  
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome.   I will begin with an 
overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at 
today’s meeting.  
My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with 
a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people.  The U.S. economy 
is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.  
The jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or 
remain in the workforce.  The unemployment rate is near historic low s, and inflation remains 
near our 2 percent goal.  We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid 
pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018.  We believe that our 
current policy stance is appropriate.  
Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the 
world that bear close attention.  Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my 
colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of pol icy may be 
needed.  Let me  explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a 
wait-and-see approach to changes.  
With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong —in 
fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest  year in more than a decade.  For some time, most forecasts have 
called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace.  For example, 
last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 perce nt this year.   
 Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than 
expected.  Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter.  While conditions 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 o f 23 
 have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018.  Growth 
has slowed in some foreign economies —notably , in Europe and China.  While the U.S. economy 
showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this 
year have been somewhat more mixed.  Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was 
followed by little growth at all in February.  Smoothing through these variations, average 
monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains 
remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.  Many other 
labor market indicators continue to show strength.  Weak retail sales data for December bounced 
back considerably in January but , on balance , seem to point to somewhat slower growth in 
consumer spending.  Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than 
last year.  Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer -term inflation expectations 
remain at the low end  of their ranges in recent years.  Along with these developments, 
unresolved policy issues , such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations , pose some risks to 
the outlook. 
Much of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varie d 
indicators.  Today’s Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of 
individual Committee participants.  And these views are in line with a broad range of other 
forecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remai ning favorable.  FOMC 
participants sought —now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unem ployment rate 
remaining below 4  percent.  Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy 
prices, remains close to 2  percent.  Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push 
headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary.  Now , I’m 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 o f 23 
 describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth 
and inflation this year could be stronger or wea ker than what we now project. 
The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral —the rate that 
tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy.  As I noted, my colleagues and I think that 
this setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing 
the need for any change in the stance of policy.  “Patient ” means that we see no need to rush to 
judgment.  It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a 
change in policy.  
In discussing the Committee’s projections, it’s  useful to note what those projections are, 
as well as what they are not.  The SEP includes participants’ individual projections of the most 
likely economic sc enario , along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate 
in that scenario.  Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy 
discussions.  We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worr isome 
outcomes.  These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not 
reflected in projections of the most likely case.  Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate 
projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision.  They are not a Committee plan.  As Chair 
Yellen noted some years ago, t he FOMC statement , rather than the dot plot,  is the device that the 
Committee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates . 
Today the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans —
revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans .  We have long said that the size of the 
balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest 
level consistent with conductin g monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  We have sought to 
make the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 o f 23 
 disruption and risks to our dual -mandate objectives.  Today’s announcement is the result of 
discussi ons over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals.  The plans 
have many technical details, and I’ll be happy to answer questions on those details .  But, for 
now, I’ll summarize the key elements.  
Since October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not 
reinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid.  Today we 
announced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff 
entirely in September of  this year.  
In September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct 
policy efficiently and effectively.  If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings 
roughly constant for a time.  During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our 
other nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances.  When the 
Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to 
rise, as dictated by the grow th of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities.  We believe 
that these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make 
additional adjustments if conditions warrant.  
The Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the 
desired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities.  We maintain our long-
stated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities. 
Thank you.  And I will be glad to take your questions. 
HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  On the broader economy, 
can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown?   Some of the actions today 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 o f 23 
 look like there is more worry .  And on the balance sheet, can you clar ify:  Does the FOMC see 
the runoff as  a form of monetary tightening?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one.  So, as I mentioned, 
FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what 
we saw  back in —at the end of last year.  And part of that is seeing that economic 
fundamentals —underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong.  You have a strong labor 
market by most measures.  You have rising incomes.  You ’ve got very low unemployment.  You 
have confiden ce surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and 
you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of 
months ago.  So we see the outlook as a positive one. 
As far as  balance sheet —the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether 
that’s related to our monetary policy , in effect, and the answer is really “ no.”  We are—we still—
we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of 
ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months .  
And we ’re not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how 
global developments are affecting the U.S.?  What ’s the cause of the weakness over there?  How 
much is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here ?  And what impact are tariffs , both in 
the United States and retal iatory tariffs , having on both the U.S. and the global economies?  
Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017.  
That was the year of synchronized global growth.   And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for 
more of the same.  What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow, 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 o f 23 
 and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially —and so has 
the Chinese economy, although the European economy more.  And just as st rong global growth 
was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy.  How big is that 
effect?  It ’s hard to be precise about it, but , clearly , we will feel that.  It is an integrated global 
economy, and global financial markets are int egrated as well.  
In terms of what ’s causing it, it seems to be a range of different things.  In China , you 
have, you know, factors that are very specific to China.  The main point , though, is that, I would 
say, the outlook—let ’s look at the outlook.  Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the 
middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that , ultimately , 
Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level.  And in Europe, you know, we see some 
weakening, but, again, we don’ t see—we don’ t see recession, and w e do see positive growth still.  
You ask about tariffs.  I would say , tariffs may be a factor in China.  I don’ t think they ’re 
the main factor.  I think the main factors are the de levering campaign that th e government 
undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer -term slowing to a more sustainable pace 
of growth that economies find as they mature.  In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs 
is relatively small in the size of our economy —relative to the size of our economy.  We have, 
since the beginning of the year —and before , really —been hearing from our extensive network of 
business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported 
products , and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry , so there ’s a 
fair amount of uncertainty.  It’s hard to say how much of an effect that ’s having on our economy.  
It’s very hard to tease that apart .  But I will say , it’s been a prominent concern among our 
business contacts for some time now.

 JAMES PUZZANGHERA.  Hi.  Thank you, Chairman.  I want to switch gears 
temporarily to Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a 
5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various 
consumer abuse and reports that new consumer -unfriendly sales incentives are returning.  Do 
you have concerns about Wells Fargo ’s efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset 
cap to remai n in place beyond this year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Wells Fargo.  So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a 
remarkably widespread series of breakdowns , really , in their risk -management apparatus, which 
resulted in significant consumer abuses , let’s say.  And as  it’s gone on and on, it ’s become clear 
that—I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be 
addressed in a fundamental kind of a way.  So there ’s a lot of work to do on that .  And we put in 
place, really , an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift 
that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those 
plans, and we ’re satisfied with what they ’ve done.  And that ’s not where we are right now.  
JAMES PUZZANGHERA.  Do you believe it ’s appropriate —do you believe it ’s 
appropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions , in terms of 
corporate governance?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its 
risk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach.  We don’ t approve 
individual pay packages.  We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of 
compensation practices that don’ t reward short -term risk -taking and that sort of thing.  And w e 
will supervise based on that.

 MICHAEL MCKEE.   Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  I wonder 
if you could discuss the balance of risks.  I know you said that the outlook among the C ommittee 
members is a positive one, but since the end o f the meeting, the 3- month– 10-year Treasury 
spread has fallen to 7 basis  points, and now, according to f ed funds futures trading, there ’s a 
50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January.  How far off are  the market s?  W hat do you 
think the risks actually are?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to 
move in one direction or another, in my view.  I would say it this way :  We see a positive 
outlook for this year, a favorable out look for this year, as I mentioned.  So, in our SEP 
projections, C ommittee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent.  They 
see unemployment remaining below 4 percent.  They see inflation remaining close to target.  
And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent.  So, you know, that ’s a positive outlook.  It’s a 
favorable outlook.  We ’re also very mindful —and we have been, of course, all along —of what 
the risks are.  And you see —you mentioned  some of them .  You know , you see slowing global 
growth.  You still have —there’ s no resolution of Brexit.  There’ s no resolution, really , of the 
trade talks.  These are ongoing risks.  We ’re also carefully monitoring what ’s happening with 
U.S. growth.  We called that out in our st atement.  You know, the limited data that we have do 
show a slowdown.  On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic 
fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive.  So that ’s really how we’ re thinking 
about it. 
JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.   I’m curious, 
you’re now a full percentage point —actually , more than a percentage point —below the White 
House in your projections for growth this year.  By my calculations, that ’s the largest spread 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 o f 23 
 we’ve seen since the end of the recession b etween the White House and the F ed.  Why, for one, 
do you see —do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at 
all about imp lications for policy from that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I haven ’t—I haven ’t seen their projection.  I wouldn’ t comment on 
their projection.  I would take it this way.  You can think of growth as being composed of two 
things.  And one is really growth in the workforce —more hours worked.  And the other is 
productivity —it’s output per hour.  You can really think of growth as those two things.  And I ’ve 
been calling —often mentioning  these days that it would be great if we had national -level policies 
to support higher labor force participation.  The United States is now one of t he lowest countries 
among the advanced economies , in terms of our labor force participation by prime -age workers.  
And that ’s a place where we can grow faster.  If we can bring more people into the labor force 
and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a 
great thing for the country.  So  I would like to see that. 
Productivity is much harder.  It’s v ery difficult to  project productivity over long stretches 
of time.  It’s a function of evolving technology.  So , I guess I would say, what is the potential 
growth rate?  It’s quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you 
know, undertake an ef fort to make it be as  high as it can sustainably be.  
JIM TANKERSLEY.   A quick follow -up on that .  Do you see the tax cuts —the 2017 tax 
cuts as having provided a large boost to labor force  participation as the White House does ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I would say so.  I think it ’s clear that the tax and spending policies 
that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year.  And it ’s also 
the case, I think, that they should have some supply -side effects.  I think it ’s hard to know, it ’s 
hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they ’re—we hope they ’re very large.  You 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 o f 23 
 know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, 
which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor 
force participation.  I wouldn’ t want to be handing —you know, assigning credit  or blame for 
that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last , really , three or 
four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn’ t see coming, and it ’s extremely 
welcome.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger  with the Associated Press.  With the new 
dot plot today, you’ ve gone from two rate hikes in 2019 to zero.  You still have one showing for 
next year.  The f ed funds futures trading , as has been alluded to, is  showing rate cuts at the end 
of this year.  Are they —is that a possibility in your mind , given the sharp change you’ ve made at 
this meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.   As I mentioned, the data that we ’re seeing are not currently sending a 
signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we ’re being patient.  
We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral.  The economy is growing at about  trend.  
Inflation is close to target.  Une mployment is under 3 percent.1  It’s a great time for us to be 
patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida  with Politico.  On stress testing, I wanted to 
ask, how do you respond to criticism that the F ed’s recent move to remove the qualitative 
objection from CCAR makes it less transparent to the general public?  And then, also, Governor 
Brainard dissented on that decision, and she ’s dissented on some other decisions as  well 
regulatorily recently.  Does  it concern you, given that the F ed has traditionally been a consensus -
                                                 
1 Chair Powell intended to say that the unemployment rate is under 4 percent.  
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 o f 23 
 based organization, if you keep having thes e decisions where, you know, a B oard member is not 
onboard with them?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR .  And U.S .—the 
large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at 
the capital planning process .  And for , really , some time now, for a couple of years, we ’ve talked 
about moving supervision of that process —moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than 
having a pass/fail in the stress tests .  We ’ve been talking about that for quite a while .  And I 
think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that .  It shouldn’ t 
be a big surprise —something we ’ve been talking a bout doing for a couple of years.  For banks 
that are newer to CCAR and haven ’t made that kind of progress, then they ’re still going to be 
part of —they ’re still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach  similar levels of 
achievement.  
In terms of having disparate views, I —look, we try —we are very much a consensus -
driven organization.  We try very hard to reach consensus on things.  In the end, it ’s very healthy 
to have disparate v iews and to state them publicly and put them on the record.  It’s nothing but 
healthy from my standpoint.  We ’ll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I ’m 
committed to that.  
TREVOR HUNNICUTT.  Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters.  Just —you mentione d that 
you have , kind of , a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the 
household side and the business side.  Given how big of a part of the U.S. economy that is, what 
gives you, kind of , confidence that both the slowdown we ’re seeing is temporary ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on 
retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading .  And, you know, it was a 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 o f 23 
 surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a signif icant amount of other data.  We ’re not 
dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending ?  
It’s 70 percent of the economy, as you point out .  It’s strong economic underlying fundamentals , 
so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job 
creation , confidence.  The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they 
were last summer.  So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks l ike a setting in 
which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals.  And that ’s 
really what we’ re thinking there.  So, you know, we ’re also patiently watching and waiting and 
not assuming.  We ’re not taking no signal from the incomi ng data ; that’s why we called it out in 
our statement.  So I t hink our eyes are open on this. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.   Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, in 1998 the 
Fed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have 
helped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble .  And financial conditions have eased considerably 
this year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January .  The S&P, for example, is  just 
3 percent below last summer ’s peak.  And so, I wonder, does this episode from 20 years ago bear 
at all on your thinking today about the risks posed by rising asset values in an environm ent of a 
shallower policy path?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We ’re in a very different world today and post -crisis, because we 
now very care fully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing 
basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meeting s and briefings 
where we look deeply into these things.  So this is something we have very much on our radar 
screen.  And I would say , overall , we don ’t see financial stability vulnerabilities as high.  There 
are some aspects of the financial markets that we’ re carefully monitoring, and those are in the 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 o f 23 
 nature o f things that might b e amplifiers to a downturn—as opposed to a financial stability 
concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don’ t see.  So we 
do monitor that . 
And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and 
financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world.  We do think that the principal 
tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential 
tools, and those sorts of things a s opposed to changing the interest rate.  But we ’re certainly very 
mindful of financ ial conditions and those risks. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could ask a follow -up—i f it’s the case that we’ re in a lower 
neutral interest rate world where you could have more asse t price appreciation, do you think the 
Fed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn’ t have to lean  on monetary policy to do 
so much ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  It’s a very difficult question with a long answer.  We —in our system, 
we mainly rely on “ through the cycle ” tools like high capital and stress tests.  Our financial 
stability system is built on those tools :  high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress 
testing.  So those are always on.  We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, 
which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal.  But we do 
rely on those tools.  And I would say , our banks are well capitalized.  They ’re far better 
capital ized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial 
crisis.  So they ’ll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states o f the economy.  
DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Included in the President ’s fiscal 2020 
budget is a new estimate that the nation ’s debt will balloon to more than $31 trillion over the 
next decade, by 2029.  You’ ve previously said that the country is on an unsustainable fiscal path.  
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 o f 23 
 How alarming is that number to you ?  And, while the United Sta tes might not be quite there yet, 
when do you begin to worry about a possible credit crisis?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I do think that deficits matter, and I do think— I think it ’s not really 
controversial to say that our debt can ’t grow faster than our economy indefi nitely and that ’s what 
it’s doing now.  So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can ’t really lose 
sight of that, and I ’d like to see a greater focus on that over time.  It’s not in the nature of a near -
term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn’ t want to try to predict when that would 
happen, but it is something that it ’s important that the public discussion really come back to, if I 
can say that .  And we will have to deal with it eventually.  
JAMES POLITI.   James Politi of the Financial Times.  There’ s huge uncertainty at the 
moment over the fate of the Brexit negotiations.  How much of a factor has this been for the F ed 
in turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what ’s your base case on 
that?  And on the size of the balance sheet, what ’s your —do you have a numerical estimate for 
where it will be at the end of Septemb er once the runoff is complete?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we ’re watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can 
be resolved in an orderly way.  From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that 
we’ve been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the 
United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they ’re ready for the  full range 
of possible outcomes to the —to Brexit.  So —and in doing so, we ’ve also had —we ’ve also 
worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU.  So we do, again, hope that 
that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilien t to 
different kinds of events.  
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 o f 23 
 In terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of 
approximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at 
the end of 2014—s o, significa ntly smaller relative to GDP than it was.  I’m guess ing you’re 
looking for a dollar number , though, probably, and that would be —so , for the size of the balance 
sheet, it looks like it’ ll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then. 
GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketW atch.  Chairman Powell, could you talk 
through your outlook for inflation this year?  Aren’t —you’re  not concerned about it ?  And 
rising —why aren ’t risin g wages feeding into inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Let me take wages first, if I can.  So wages have moved up in the last 
couple of years and are now running at healthier , higher levels, and that ’s a good thing .  In fact, a 
lot of the wage gains have been going to lower -paid workers , as can happen late in the cycle, 
which is also a good thing.  So —but that ’s not price inflation , that’s wage inflation.  Our 
mandate, sorry, is price inflation.  So what I see is inflation that’ s close to 2 percent but that sort 
of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe  moving back down a little bit.  
And I don’t feel that  we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a 
symmetrical way.  Now, what do we mean by “ symmetrical” ?  What we really mean is that we 
would look at —we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we 
say is  that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as  persistently below 
the target.  
So that ’s really our framework .  And I don’t think we’ve quite achieved that yet, because 
we’re really 10 years deep in this —almost 10 years —in this exp ansion, and inflation is still kind 
of, I’d say , not, you know, clearly meeting our target.  So that ’s one of the reasons why we ’re 
being patient.  I think, as I’ve said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target—
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 o f 23 
 particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for 
most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that  core will be too—t hat gives us 
the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being ac hieved.  
GREG ROBB.  I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the C ommittee —
you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is 
the story that emerges?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So there are a bunch of different stories.  There ’s no real easy 
answer.  One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think.  
That’s one way to think about it, that there’ s still more slack in the economy.  Another is tha t 
expectations play a very —inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other 
frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations 
being anchored but below 2 percent.  And so, either way, inflatio n itself has kind of bounced 
around a little below 2 percent.  That ’s the record.  
PAUL KIERNAN.   Hi, Chairman Powell .  Thanks for the question.  Paul Kiernan from 
Dow Jones Newswires.  I’m just kind of curious —I mean , this below -target inflation is a globa l 
phenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I’d just like to kind of hear your thoughts 
about what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy 
in general.  Ye s, thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  It’s a major challenge.  It’s one of the major challenges of our time, 
really, to have inflation— you know, downward pressure on inflation, let ’s say.  It gives central 
banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right ?  So if inflation expectations a re 
below 2 percent, they ’re always going to be pulling inflation down, and we’re going to be 
paddling upstream in  trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 o f 23 
 to cut, you know, when it’ s time to cut rates when the economy weak ens.  And, you know, that ’s 
something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too.  It’s 
one of the —one of the things we ’re looking into as  part of our strategic monetary policy review 
this year.  The proximity to the  zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we 
can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we ’re open minded 
about ways we can do that. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network.  So I counted 
five downgrades in the first paragraph of the FOMC statement.  What conditions do you need to 
see in order for a rate cut or a rate hike on the other side of that then?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , we—I think we were —we wanted to be careful to go ahead 
and acknowledge the things.  I think it’ s relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were 
careful to point out lower retail sales —the weak November meeting —BFI, all those things , and I 
think that was the right thing to do.2  Notwithstanding th at, we do have a positive outlook for the 
year for the reasons I mentioned— you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et  cetera.  
So, and in terms of what it would take, I’d say, again, today we don’ t see any —we don’ t see data 
coming in that suggest s that we should move in either direction.  They suggest that we should 
remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time.  When the time comes, we ’ll act 
appropriately.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi.  Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  Fed Vice Chairman Rich 
Clarida has talked about how the decline in labor ’s share of income and the corresponding high 
profit margins might mean that lower unemployment and high er wage growth is not flowing 
through to price inflation the way it used to.  Bu t, so far throughout this tightening cycle , the Fed 
                                                 
2 Chair Powell intended to point to  the weak reading on retail sales  for December 2018.  
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 o f 23 
 has not allowed wage growth to rise above longer -term interest rates until just very recently .  So 
I’m wondering if , going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit 
margins and t he linkage between wages and prices, would you be in favor of allowing wage 
growth to continue accel erating without matching that with  higher interest rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , let me say that we ’ve had, you know, a significant move up in 
wages and compe nsation over the last few years, and I —which does not trouble me from the 
standpoint of inflation.  We ’ve had —also had —in other cycles, we’ve had situations where, you 
know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn’ t lead to price inf lation.  It 
does—you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins , and, you know, that can ’t go on 
indefinitely .  But, nonetheless, I don’t see the current wage picture as concernin g from an 
inflation standpoint. 
MATTHEW BOESLER.  More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of 
interest rates allows households to pay down debt faster , whereas interest rates in excess of wage 
growth risk s a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability 
consequences of varyi ng interest  rates relative to wage growth?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t think we look at —I understand what you’re asking, but we ’re 
looking at —our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that ’s what we ’re 
looking at with setting interest rates.  And we also monitor financial stability very carefully 
across all meaningful asset categories.  I don’ t think we tie it particularly to the relationship 
you’re talking about.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer  with Marketplace.  Just a 
quick foll ow-up on Brexit.  You mentioned that you’re making sure that U.S. financial 
institutions are ready for whatever outcome.  I’m wondering, can you be a little more specific 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 o f 23 
 about that ?  And also, how are you preparing for any pressures that a hard Brexi t would put on 
the U.S. dollar?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress test s that the largest 
financial institutions —and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally —that they 
undergo every year, we put them through very  large financial shocks with large losses and big 
changes in markets every year.  And we vary that every year.  So that ’s a pretty good —you 
know, having done that for a number of years now, that ’s—and having them be required to have 
adequate capital and li quidity even after all that happens.  So that ’s a good thing to have done , 
knowing that you’re going into something that ’s quite unknown, which may prove stressful , it 
may not prove stressful , depending on what the outcome is.  So I think all that has probably 
prepared our institutions well.  That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so 
it’s really hard to be confident.  So we ’re very watchful about what ’s going on. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And as far as the dollar goes?  
CHAIR POWELL.  S o we don’ t—you know, we —the dollar is really the business of the 
Treasury Department.  It’s certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, 
but we don’ t, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies . 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi.  John Heltman— John Heltman with American Banker.   I have a 
question about the F ed’s proposal from October of last year regarding enhanced prudential 
standards for banks above $250 billion.  Some analysts have suggested that tha t proposal could 
encourage consolidation mergers and acquisition among banks , particularly at the upper end of  
the range.  I’m curious if the F ed anticipated that outcome and whether you have any 
reservations or whether you—the F ed cares about ban k consoli dation more generally.  
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 o f 23 
 CHAIR POWELL.  We ’re not motivated by a particular view of industry structure that 
we’re trying to achieve through our regulation.  I think we want to have banks of all different 
sizes and with different business models out there car rying out their functions in the economy.  
So that ’s how we think about that. 
I would also say, when banks merge and move into a larger asset category, they get 
stronger regulation, not weaker regulation.  So if you think about it, you know, if you’re a 
medium -sized bank and you merge with another medium -sized bank, you w ind up being more 
than a medium -sized bank, you know.  
But the sense of our tapering is that —“tailoring, ” sorry —our tailoring policy is that the 
highest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex 
institutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the 
risks that that institution actually presents to the economy .  So— 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chair  Powell.  Brian Ch eung wi th Yahoo Finance.  Thanks for 
taking my question.  So as the F ed remains on pause, does the c entral bank find the onus on 
fiscal policy to extend its economic recovery and f end off a slowdown—as in , is the F ed 
positioning itself to take on a reactionary role to whatever fiscal policy is doing ?  I’m asking 
because we’re seeing the waning  effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, s o 
just wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy –fiscal policy balance is in swing 
right  now . 
CHAIR PO WELL.  So we take—we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to 
what we do.  You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that.  We 
don’t evaluate it , we don ’t criticize it, and we don ’t overreact to it either.  So I think it’ s just a 
fact.  It’s just an external fact about the economy for us.  I mean , our policy is —the reason we ’re 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 o f 23 
 on hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good 
place, and we’re watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home, 
and we think that ’s what we need to be doing.  
STEVEN BECKNER.   Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR, Mr. 
Chairman.  The F ed has been allowing the average maturity of securities in its bond  portfolio to 
lengthen.  Is this aimed at—consciously aimed at flattening the yield curve, and is that going to 
be part of the Fed’s longer -run balance sheet strategy?  And if flattening the yield curve is a 
conscious long- term strategy, are you concerned about the side effect of the heightening 
concerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve being a harbinger of recession ?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The basic answer to your question is “ no.”  We are—the decision 
about t he maturity composition of the F ed’s balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us.  We 
have not made that decision, and we’re—we really haven ’t begun to have a serious series of 
discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that.  That, I think, will be something we 
turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time.  It’s a consequential decision and one 
that needs some thought.  We ’ve had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the 
last four meetings, but this is the next big one that—big decision that w e’ll face.  And, you know, 
I think we ’re not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we ’ll turn to it soon. 
STEVEN BECKNER.  Can I just follow  up, please?  Well , how do you account for the 
fact that the average maturity has in fact been lengthening and co ntributing to a flattening of the 
yield curve?  Is that —what’s —what ’s causing that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think, isn ’t it just that as securities roll off , you wind up investing 
in—you know, as a 10- year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10- year, and automatically  that 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 o f 23 
 lengthens things.  It’s not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet.  It’s just been —we try to 
have a practice that we don’ t deviate from , and it’ s transparent , and—no policy message in that.  
JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market New s.  I wanted to ask, at what point do you 
expect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again?  What are—how will you make 
that decision?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I —as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at 
about —at September  30.  A nd if it is our view at that time that we ’re still a ways away from—a 
ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently  and effectively conduct monetary 
policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant.  A nd then what ’ll happen is , 
organically , very gradually , currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow , and reserves 
will shrink.  
And the question you’re asking is , how long will that go on?  The truth is, we don’ t 
know, and we don ’t really know that we ’ll move past September  30th.  The level of reserve 
demand is something that we ’ve put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates , based on 
market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing.  The truth is, we don’ t know.  It may 
evolve over time.  So we ’ll just have t o see.  I wouldn’ t want to put a time out there for that, 
but—so I’ll just leave it th ere. 
COURTENAY BROWN .  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Are you 
concerned at all what the market impact will be should the F ed resume policy tig htening 
somewhere down the line?   As I’m sure you know , the market lis tens to you very, very closely.  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I ’m just going to say that I think we ’re in a good place 
right now, which is , we’re being patient, we ’re watching , we don’ t see any data pushing us to 
March 20, 2019      Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 o f 23 
 move rates in either direction, and we ’re going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow 
events to evolve .  And when they do clar ify, we will act appropriately.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  
May 1, 2019 
 
CHAIR POWELL .  Good afternoon, and welcome.  At the FOMC meeting that 
concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the Uni ted States and 
around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged.   
My colleagues and I have one overarching goal:  to use our monetary policy tools to 
sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the 
American people.  Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with 
our expectations.  Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we 
anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker.  Overall, the economy continues  on a 
healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate.  
The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the 
economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and j ob growth, 
rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment.  Job gains rebounded in March a fter a 
weak reading in February  and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the 
pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force.  Although first -quarter GDP rose more 
than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed 
investment slowed.  Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting 
our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year.   
The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  For 
much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside 
considerable slack in resource utilization.  But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 
4 percent, inflation moved up.  From March through December, core inflation—which excludes 
volatile food and energy components —was at or very close to 2 percent.  Overall inflation 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 20  
 fluctuated from a few ten ths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the 
moves mostly due to changes in energy prices.  As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of 
this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system.  Overall inflation fo r the 
12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent.  Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, 
and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months.  We suspect that some 
transitory factors may be at work.  Thus, our baseline view remains t hat, with a strong job market 
and continued growth, inflation wil l return to 2 percent over time  and then be roughly symmetric 
around our longer -term objective.   
At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents  presented risks to the outlook, 
including  weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive 
Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations.  While concerns remain in all of 
these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat.  Global financ ial conditions have 
eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy 
and, in some cases , fiscal policy.  Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, 
and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now.  Further, there are reports of 
progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.  The Committee views these 
developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted 
inflation  pressures , as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in 
monetary policy.   
Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about 
our balance sheet.  In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary pol icy using our 
current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves.  In March, we 
decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff , starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely

Page 3 of 20  
 in September.  These plans support our longer -run dual -mandate objectives and also provide 
clarity about the path of our asset holdings.  
Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer -run maturity composition of the 
portfolio.  Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter -term debt of the 
federal government.  In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer -term 
securities with the aim of lowering longer -term interest rates and, thus , supporting the recovery.  
Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer -term securities.  As part 
of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term.  
This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy.   
Today ’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and 
discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the 
year.  There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately 
reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for 
smooth adjustment.  As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet 
normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds.   
Final ly, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing 
monetary policy :  the interest  rate on excess reserves, or  IOER rate.  The change does not reflect 
any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.  We use the IOER rate to help keep the 
federal funds rate in our target range.  As balance sheet normalization continues, we have 
expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate.  
Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range 
after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range.  These actions helped keep the 
effective federal funds rate well within the  target  range.  And t oday we made one more such 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 20  
 change.  The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, 
and it remains unchanged.   
Thank you very much .  I will be glad  to take your questions. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chair .  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  As the statement 
noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent —it’s been falling for three straight months , 
and while you’ ve been close, it ’s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012.  Mr. 
Chair , I guess I wonder , is it time to address low inflation through policy , and can you give us 
some sense of your metric for when it would be time?  At what level would it require a policy 
response from the Committee?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation 
objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.  As I mentioned, we think our 
policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’ t see a strong case for moving in either 
direction.  I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation —actually ran 
pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.   
As you point out, both headline and core , though, did come in on the soft side in the first 
quarter , and that was not expected as it relates to core.  So we say in our S tatement of Longer -
Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation 
were running persistently above or below 2 percent.  So “ persistent ” carries the sense of 
something that ’s not transient, something that will sustain over a per iod of time.  And in this 
case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think 
that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient.  And I ’d point to things 
like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.  In addition, the 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 20  
 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.  I ndeed, the Dallas trimmed mean 
is at 2 percent.   
But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent —inflation running persistently 
below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we 
would take into account in setting policy.  
SAM FLEMING.  Thanks very much.  Sam Fleming from the Financi al Times.   Let me 
carry on on the same theme.  There ’s obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the 
prospects for a rate reduction this year.  Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of 
themselves on this?  And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious 
consideration of a rate cut?  The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example —do you 
actually need to see a looming recession to cut rates , or could an insurance cut be appropriate?  
Thanks.  
CHAIR P OWELL.  So as I mentioned, we ’ve just come through a two- day meeting , and 
we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the 
world and thought about our policy , and we do think our policy stance is appropriate r ight now.  
We don’ t see a strong case for moving in either direction.  So — w e do, of course , though—as a 
routine matter , as you well know —we look not only at our baseline , but we also look at 
alternative simulations, both better and worse , and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy 
response would be .  But that ’s all we do .  And I would just say that we ’re comfortable —the 
Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Shifting gear s a little 
bit, I wondered if you could flesh out —I know you’ re describing it as a small technical 
adjustment , but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 20  
 not this breaches the upper limit a little bit.  Is there any f eed-throug h to broader credit 
conditions and financial conditions that you worry about , or is it simply a matter of the Fed 
showing that it can control what it says it’ s controlling?  And I do have a follow -up.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So a small, temporary deviat ion outside of the range would really 
carry no —wouldn’ t be important, as your question suggests.  But we do think it ’s important that 
we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.  That ’s just 
good monetary policy, good monetary control.  So we think it ’s important , and we have the tools 
to do that , so we ’ve use d them again today .  And, again, this is just a technical fix.  It really has 
no implications for policy.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But a s a follow -up on this, it is demonstrating that you can 
control the market you want to control.  And I guess the question is , at what point would these 
steady declines in the IOER —steady widening of this spread , if it continues , essentially become 
the poli cy choice?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s, I mean —so , generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we 
control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate.  And the transmission of 
the federal funds rate into other short -term rates —money market rate s—has been very good over 
a long period of time.  And that ’s important , because it ’s really broader financial conditions that 
matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate.  So I think the Fed controlling the federal 
funds rate is actually important from that standpoint , and I don’ t see us not controlling it.  So I 
think we ’ll continue to control it , and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial 
conditions.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg.  I’m curious about the financial  
conditions that you see out there.  The minutes of the March meeting tell us “ a few ” officials  
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 20  
 worried about financial stability risks.  Was there a broader discussion at this meeting?  Any 
consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit ne w highs , and we do see some 
instability in short- end trading —is it possible that rates are too low at this point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for 
comment every other meeting.  So we had our quarterly briefing today —yesterday, as a matter of 
fact—and had that discussion as well.  And I think there haven’ t been a lot of changes since the 
last meeting , but I ’ll just go through the way we think about it.  First, we ’ve developed and 
published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities —put it out for comment 
and welcome any feedback that we get from the public.  And that enables us to focus our 
assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.   
So there are four aspects of it that I ’ll go through quickly , but I ’d say that the headline 
really is that while there  are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding 
is that, overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are mod erate, on balance .  And, in addition, I 
would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital 
and liquidity.  But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.  And as for asset prices, some 
asset prices  are somewhat elevated , but I would say not extremely so.   
Leverage in the financial sector —I mentioned households are actually in good shape 
from a leverage standpoint.  Default rates are low.  Borrowing is relatively low.  Nonfinancial 
corporates is an area that we’ ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns 
about that —not so much from a financial stability standpoint , but from the standpoint that having 
a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn.   
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 20  
 And then the last two —the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial 
system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United 
States.  So , on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up on that —I’m just curious as to whether the 
level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates.  
CHAIR POWELL.   So we do say that risks to the financial system —we say in our 
longer -run stat ement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks  to the financial system that 
could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.  I 
would say  that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns a re better —capital 
liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that.  Those are better first -order 
tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell,  with the 
benefit of hindsight, did last year ’s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 
2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact , a ceiling?   And, if so, would it be appropriate 
to lower rates if core inflation remained  persistently closer to 1 ½ percent instead of 2 percent?   
And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates , given the recent softness 
in core inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle 
of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.  And the economy was 
quite strong and was growing strong.  The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very 
positive way.  And so I think the expectation was that inflat ion would remain up around 
2 percent.   The weak first quarter performance was not expected —of core was not expected , and 
I don ’t think is related to anything we did , in terms of raising rates.   It appears to be more —we 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 20  
 don’t know this, but you never know until—with hindsight, with perfect hindsight , but some of it 
does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic.  Now,  the second part of your question?  Sorry.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower 
rates if co re infl ation held closer to 1½ percent?  And, if not, are you worried that there is 
unwanted tightening from real rates , being where they are?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I mean —so , as I said earlier, we do address this in our , sort of , 
constitutional document.  If infl ation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently 
above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee , and the Committee would take that 
into account in making policy.  I do think it ’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably 
—for a sustained period of time —and symmetrically around 2 p ercent .  Because if it doesn ’t, 
you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on 
the downside —inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put 
downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us 
to, you know, support the economy in difficult times.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   So as you just mentioned, las t 
year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this 
benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus.  And you still have that to some extent, although the tax 
cuts have mostly fe eded through— we’ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending 
cap increases.  So , I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward 
the end of this year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Inflation, first of all—month- to-month, quarter -to-quarter —is going 
to move around.  Ther e will always be factors hitting it.  So probably the biggest single factor 
driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 20  
 expectations are anchored —the thought being , that ’s where inflation will go in the long run if it ’s 
not been pushed by those other factors.  So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the 
economy does play some small role.  It’s actually still a measurable role.  It’s nothing like it was 
in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite  steep, so that ’s also something that plays a role.   
And so we take all those things into account , and the part of it that we can control is the 
slack part.  And , again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move 
back up.  And if it isn ’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then 
that’s something we ’d take into account in setting policy.  
DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN.  Pivoting a little bit—
about wages, since 2010, women’ s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to 
men’s, which have risen about 2.1.  Do you think the relative increase in women’ s wages is a 
problem for the U .S. economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.   You know, I think, generally, I ’d have to see the data on that.  It 
sounds like you picked a particular time frame .  Over time, I really wonder whether that ’s the 
case.  You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large.  
So— 
DONNA BORAK.  Just to push a little bit on this .  But if the data shows that women ’s 
wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U .S. economy if male’ s wages are declining or 
not growing as fast as women ’s?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we ’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the 
Fed indirectl y, and that ’s something I ’d rather avoid.  It’s really not my role to engage with 
potential nominees to the F ed, so I ’m really not going to go there.  I haven ’t seen this research 
either , so I don’ t really —really  know.  Thanks.  
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 20  
 VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask —early last month, I 
believe it was April 2, the Fedwire ® system went down.  A nd I was just wondering if you could 
talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether 
you’re still looking into it, and whether it’ s something that could happen again.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So that ’s right.  I want to say it was April 1 , but it may have 
been April 2.  In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three - or fou r-hour 
range.  We were able to quickly identify the problem :  It was an internal problem , and we were 
able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat 
themselves.   So, you know, we learn from these instances .  They ’re fairly rare , but we learn from 
them , and in this case it was interna l, and it ’s been corrected.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.   Next month, we have the 10th 
anniversary of the end of the recession , and there are some countries that have had expansions 
for 15, 20, 25 years.  Do you think that ’s something that ’s practical for the U .S., that  we could 
have that kind of lengthy expansion?  And for you personally, if we had a recession during your 
tenure,  would you consider that a failure?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I wouldn’ t want to speculate.  There ’s always the 
example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of , where I think they ’re in year 28 of their 
expansion.  So things are possible.  All I c an see is that we have an economy where the 
expansion is continuing.  Growth is at a healthy level.   The labor market is strong.  We see job 
creation.  We see wages moving up.  Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient , and 
we do expect it  to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent.  So I see us on a good path 
for this year.  
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 20  
 STEVE MATTHEWS.  Do you see parallels with the 1990s , when —for example, some 
people have pointed out, in the U .S., the longest expansion before this one , there was a rate cut in 
1995, and rates went up , and then they came down , and there was that kind of management.  Do 
you see similarities in today ’s situation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Similarities in the length.  I mean, the situations were quite different 
then.  This was before inflation really was under control , but, you know, it’ s very interesting to 
look at the history.  I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.  But I think, in our own 
cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really wh at’s relevant for us now.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.   Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP.  You ’ve 
repeatedly said that the F ed’s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside 
political pressure , but it seems like the P resident is intent on in creasing that political pressure.  
Yesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing.  
What do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey 
your decisions to the public?  
CHAI R POWELL.  Ye s, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution,  and that 
means we don ’t think about short -term political considerations, we don’ t discuss them, and we 
don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other.  And what we ’re alw ays 
solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the 
economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent.  
So to give you an idea of what our process is like , maybe as a way of pu tting all that in 
context —so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive 
preparations :  catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues 
and their staff.  As you also are I ’m sure aware, Marty,  we talk to literally thousands of 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 20  
 businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector 
just to get a better sense of the economy.  We put all that together , and we come together for 
two days.  
The first day begins  with an economic briefing, which is , sort of , economic and financial 
developments in the United States and around the world.  That takes up most of the first day , and 
we talk about this in great detail.  We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the 
next day we talk about monetary policy.  And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous 
decision , after an extensive discussion , that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is.  
And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we ’re going to be patient as we 
consider adjustments.  And we also see, by the way, the evolving -risk picture as very consistent 
with that outlook.  
So we don’ t feel like the data ’s pushing us in either direction.  Of course, we ’ll not 
hesitate  if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction.  But that ’s our process.  
That’s how we think about things.  We don’ t think about other factors.  We don’ t let them into 
our decisionmaking.  We don’ t discuss them.  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Paul Kiern an from Dow Jones Newswires.  Thanks for the question.  
In the l ast 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that 
coincided with the housing bubble.  I’d like to know what you would say to people who worry 
that it will pr ove difficult for the F ed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset 
bubble of some sort.  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So you’ re pointing to, really , the fact that in recent years 
inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to 
reach their inflation goals from below.  And that includes us, although we ’ve actually done —
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 20  
 we’ve come closer, I think, than most others.  And it ’s just a question, I think, of demographic 
and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent , and it 
creates significant challenges.  One, I would say, is , it means that interest rates will be lower —
will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because t hat means lower interest 
rates.  And that ’s one of the reasons we ’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, 
tools, and communications this year —to think about that problem.  
You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower -for-longe r rates , and that is 
another challenge.  As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the 
extent they threaten achievement of our goals , but we also view, and I do take the view that 
macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do 
right through the cycle —those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the 
financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen.  
GREG ROBB.  Th ank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  This morning, the ISM 
manufacturing i ndex fell to have its worst reading since October 2016.  So isn’ t that a dark cloud 
on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year?  I mean, how much weight does it 
hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight?  
CHAIR POWELL.   This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning , on 
manufacturing.  Ye s, we see that reading as —it’ s still a positive reading and consistent with what 
we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth.  
Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.  Services have been growing faster.  So 
it’s—yes, it ’s something tha t we are watching carefully , but we do expect a positive contribution 
to growth from the manufacturing sector.

 EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, for doing this.  You mentioned—talked about domestic growth a little bit with the 
economy.  You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with 
Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress.  Could you talk 
about a little bit of the domestic growth that you ’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year ?  
And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy 
one for the U .S. economy for growth for the rest of this year.  A nd I would say that the basis for 
that, really , is consumer spending and business investment.  So if you look at consumer 
spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March.  A nd, as I 
mention ed, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of 
consumer spending —that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, 
high levels of employment, wages going up.  All those things are going to support consumer 
spending.  So that ’s a significant part of the outlook this year.  And business investment should 
also be positive in that sort of direction.  
In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the 
uncertainty a round these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business 
sentiment.  We have been hearing from our business contacts , really , a lot since the beginning of 
the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern.  If you import metals or  whatever for your 
product or export your product, then it ’s been a challenge for you.  So that would be a positive.  
And, of course, most of the gains , though, I would expect, even from a successful trade 
negotiation, would come in over time.  You know, I don’t think—i t wouldn’ t be the kind of thing 
where you ’d immediately feel big effects right away , but they could be quite important over a 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 20  
 longer period.  So that, I think—that would be my expectation.  I don ’t know , though.  I haven ’t 
seen—none of us, at  least I haven ’t seen, the details of what ’s been negotiated.  
DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L .A. Times.   Getting back to inflation, can you talk more 
about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think 
those facto rs will pass?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  Well, I would just mention a couple.  Let me say, I don ’t mean 
to diminish concerns about too- low inflation , but I think there ’s good reason to think that these 
readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.  
One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go 
down when asset prices go down, with a lag.  And so when asset prices went back up, probably 
there’ ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.  Other ones that get mentioned are 
things like apparel , and apparel prices were very, very low.  There was a change in the 
methodology.  And another one is airfares.  There are many little things.  So we don’ t know 
until, again, until we see , but there ’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn 
around.  
And another way to look at it is , there are models that look at inflation in different ways , 
like—not models, but measures , like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned.   So trimmed 
mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean 
movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories , and it didn’ t go 
down at all.  It’s at 2 percent —or it’s at, I don’ t know whether it went down  or was above that , 
but it ’s at 2 percent now.  So there ’s reason to think that these will be transient.  
We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case.   I would point 
to the case of cell phone  services.  Many of you wil l remember , in March of 2017, there was a 
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 20  
 very low reading for cell phone services —mobile phone services —and it was kind of a price 
war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year , but it did not look like something that 
would be repeated.  And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we 
had those months of 2 percent inflation.  
So, again, we’ ll have to see here.   We ’re going to be watching —really, I ’d like to say 
we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that t hese things are transient , and I ’ll end 
by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Just following up, Chair  Powell .  Nancy Marshall -
Genzer with Marketplace.  You were saying if inflation does stay low  and these low inflation 
rates are not transient, you said a couple times you ’ll take that into account with monetary policy.  
How, specifically, will you take that into account?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s, it’s hard to say , because there’ s so many other variable s.  
Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time , but that ’s part of 
our mandate.  Stable prices is half of our mandate , and we ’ve defined that as 2 percent .  So we  
woul d be concerned, and we’ d take it into account.  
NAN CY MARSHALL -GENZER.  So a cut in interest rates would be possible?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I can ’t really be any more specific than what I ’ve said.  
JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with Market  News.  If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do 
you see room for another IOER adjustment?  And then, can you speak to any other strategies or 
tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short -term interest rates?  There have been 
other ideas floated , like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate.  
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 20  
 CHA IR POWELL.   If we need to , and as needed , we will use our tools to keep the 
federal funds rate somewhere in the target range.  We’ll do that.  Don ’t expect to need to do it 
again , but we don’ t know.  
I mean, we’re —with—the balance sheet is now —the size of it is going to be driven by 
demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned.  And we ’re right at that point where 
we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next 
few months.  And so I—there is no template for this.  There’ s no roadmap.  We just have to do it , 
and that ’s why we ’re moving so very gradually.  It’s why we tapered the roll -off to only 
$15 billion in T reasuries per month.  Effective, I guess, today, we ’re cutting the roll- off rate for 
Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here.  So that ’s that.  
In terms of other tools, we ’re actually —I’m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be 
looking at the idea of a repo facility.  I don’ t have any presu pposition that it ’s something we 
would do, but we ’ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox.  Again, I wouldn’ t 
say—it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think 
carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then 
go away and think about it for a little while.  And then probably come back and make a decision.  
But that ’s something we ’ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine.  
HANNAH LANG.  Hannah Lang, American Banker.   On the regulatory side, the F ed and 
other bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling  a proposal to revise the 
Volcker r ule.  Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution 
and what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or 
making changes to the original proposal?  
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 20  
 CHAIR POWELL.  You know , we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we 
got a lot of comments , and we’ re reviewing them carefully.   I really don ’t have a lot for you.  I 
know they ’re making good progress.  I don’ t really have a date though.  And in terms of what all 
it’s going to be, it ’s not something I can say with any certainty yet.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  So given what you ’ve 
said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps 
bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I ’m wondering if you think that continued growth in 
economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another 
overheating.   For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 
was 2.1, so I ’m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see 
strong GDP numbers.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we don’ t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing.  
We see inflation below 2 percent now —as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last 
year.  So, really, no signs of overheating.  
If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of 
labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing.  Nonetheless, you 
have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate , given 
inflation and given productivity , but not at all signaling any overheating at all.  It’s not higher 
than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity .  So, really not seeing signs 
of overheating at the moment.  
HEATHER LONG.  Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle?  
Can you kind of give us a read on—but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the 
Committee views productivity growth, if it’ s accelerating enough?  
May 1, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 20  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s—in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved 
up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now —wages and ben efits are now b etween 
3 and 3½ percent.  Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for 
people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing.  
You mentioned productivity.  So productivity is really very difficult to predict.   No one 
has been able to predict it successfully, so I won’ t really try.  But I will say this :  Productivity 
was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years.  Last year, we had 1.9 percent 
productivity, which is much higher.  I don ’t know if that level can be sustained , but we really —
it’s driven, to some extent , by technological developments and, really , the diffusion of 
technology through the economy , and it ’s very hard to predict.  So I think it ’s positive.  
In fact, I’ll mention, if we ’re talking about the supply side, labor force participation.  
Really , there has been a significant positive supply -side development over the last year  and a half 
between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also 
productivity.  And that does suggest more room to grow.  It suggests that a less tight economy , a 
less, you know —may be part of the explanation for lower inflatio n.  
Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
June 19, 2019 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon, and welcome.  My colleagues and I have one 
overarching goal:  to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, 
for the benefit of the American people.    
At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but 
made some significant changes to our statement.  Since the beginning of the year, we have 
judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in 
assessing the need for any changes.  In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation 
pressures, we now emphasize  that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of 
incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the 
expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective. 
I’d like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings 
us to today’s decision.  So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid 
fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment.  Inflation has been running 
some what below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth 
and a strong job market.  Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some 
ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth.  At the 
time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these 
crosscurrents were moderating.  The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and 
there were reports of progress in trade negotiations wi th China.  Our continued patient stance 
seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.  
In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged.  Growth indicators 
from around the world have disappointe d, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 22  
 global economy.  Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in 
business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments.  These concerns 
may have contr ibuted to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be 
starting to show through to incoming data .  Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated 
as well.  Against this back drop, inflation remains muted. 
While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties 
will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy 
accommodation.  Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more 
accommodative policy has st rengthened.  Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting 
with th e outlook for jobs and growth.  
Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next.  Monthly job gains in 
May were lower than expected, however, and , in light of recent developments , this bears 
watching.  Still, many labor market indicators remain strong.  Community, business, and labor 
leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better , and that this is true 
even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work.  Wages are rising, and this is 
particularly so for lower -paying jobs.  
Committee participants’ growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with 
a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimate s of longer -run normal 
growth.  The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the 
composition of growth.  Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, 
which had just been reported at the time of  the May FOMC meeting.  As I noted then, the 
unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories —components that are not 
generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum.  The more reliable drivers of growth in the 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 22  
 economy are spending on consumption and business investment.  While consumption was weak 
in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid 
pace.  In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business 
fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.1  Moreover, manufacturing production has posted 
declines so far this year.  Thus, while the baseline outlook remains favorable, many FOMC 
participants cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment  and the crosscurrents I 
mentioned earlier as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen.  
After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation 
declined in the first quarter.  Data since th en show some pickup.  Participants broadly see 
inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been 
expected.  The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy 
components , is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent.  
Setting aside short -term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about 
the pace of inflation’s return to 2 percent.  Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace 
that would provide much upward impetus to inflation.  Moreover, weaker global growth may 
continue to hold i nflation down around the world. 
We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well 
aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could pre cipitate a 
difficult- to-arrest downward  drift in longer -run inflation expectations.  Because there are no 
definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies.  Market -based 
measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting , and some survey -
based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges.  Combining these 
                                                 
1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter.  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 22  
 factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more 
sustained shortfall of inflation. 
Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain 
environment.  The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that 
some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely.  
Though some parti cipants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made 
clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional 
accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting.  This added accommodation would 
support economic activity and inflat ion’s return to our objective.  
Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting.  
It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short -
term swing in sentiment.  Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.  
Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to 
weigh on the outlook, a nd we will use our tools as appropriate to sus tain the expansion. 
Thank you. I will be pleased to take your questions. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.   Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, did you consider 
a rate cut today ?  Specifically , was it one of the options —the policy options in the Teal book?  
And is the Committee considering moving , given all the uncertainty you addressed , moving  its—
changing its policy before the next meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of 
global and domestic economic and financial co nditions and then spent this morning talking about 
monetary policy.  And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we ’re going to be 
monitoring —monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we ’ve mentioned, but that 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 22  
 we’d like to see  more going forward.  Particularly, we ’d like to see whether these risks co ntinue 
to weigh on the outlook.  
So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight 
of those , a strengthen ed case for cutting rates.  Eight actuall y wrote down rate cuts .  A number of 
others see that the case ha s strengthened .  But the Committee wanted to see more, as I 
mentioned.  And I also mentioned that some of these —some of these developments have been of 
quite recent vintage .  And so we do expect that we’ ll be learning a lot more on all of these issues 
in the near term.  And that ’s our focus.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Do you think something could change before the next meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I’m sure that things will change before the next meeting.  I expect a 
full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at.  I think we ’ll learn 
a great deal more about them .  And I think that ’s—we think that that ’s the right way to move 
here.  Again, many of these developments happened , you know, part of the way through the last 
intermeeting period.  Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last 
FOMC meeting feeling that the economy , and our policy , was in a good place.  So we want to 
see—we want to see and w e want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are 
genuine , and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment , which can be volatile.  
At the same time, we are —we ’re quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are pre pared to 
move and use our tools as needed t o sustain the expansion. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Could you walk us through 
your thinking about trade?  It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least 
the market  to become definitively banking , or—pricing in rate cuts .  If, for example, there ’s a 
deal with China, does that take the possibil ity of rate cuts off the table?  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 22  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Ye ah, so I would say that we ’re not looking at any one thing.  I guess 
I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver 
of sentiment in the intermeeting period.  But we ’re also looking at global growth.  It ’s really 
trade developments and concerns about globa l growth that are on our minds.  
So we ’re not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data.  Risks seem to have 
grown.  In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that ’s been pretty good, 
particularly for the consumer :  Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy 
job market, high levels of employment, wages going up.  We do see , though, some areas that 
we’re looking at , such as , I mentioned, business fixed income.2  So—also , the prolonged 
shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth—we don’ t like to look at one job report .  We like to 
average over three or six months, but still that bears watching.  
So we ’ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. 
economic outlook.  We expect to learn a good deal more , as I mentioned.  And we ’ll be asking 
the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.  And then, in the 
end, we ’ll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion. 
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post.  Could you clarify 
what you would do if the President tweets or calls you to say he would like to demote you as 
Fed Chair?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think the law is clear that I have a four -year term , and I fully intend 
to serve it.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I was hoping that —this is Jeanna Smialek from 
the New York Times.   I was hoping that you could clarify for us a little bit how you ’re thinking 
                                                 
2 Chair Powell intended to say “business fixed investment.”  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 22  
 about the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus the risks of cutting rates prematurely —sort 
of, what the balance of risks are and how you talk about that. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So we ’re always trying to balance that risk, but I would say 
that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt , though, that 
the right thing to do was to wait and see more.  And we will see a lot more on all  of these issues 
in the very near term.  So I don ’t think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now.  I 
would say , as a general matter, it ’s always something that we h ave to weigh.  But I think we 
believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks 
unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  [Inaudible]  
CHAIR POWELL.  Obviously , we try to av oid going prematurely as well.  In this case, 
you know, there ’s always some judgment in these things.  But I would just say that the risks that 
we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of 
us to write down rate cuts , and a number of those who haven’ t to see that the case has 
strengthened.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the AP.  You had your first dissent in 
your time as C hairman.  Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that  was 
pushing for a rate cut this time?  And how do you —do you expect further dissents going 
forward?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time , before there 
had been a ny dissents, a nd that is that I think the process of careful , thoughtful dissent is a very 
healthy one, and I ’ve always believed that .  And I feel like you make better decisions when you 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 22  
 hear a disparity of views .  So I really do look at it that way.  I would add, though, that the support 
for the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad. 
JAMES POLITI.  James Politi with the Financial Times.  Mario Draghi at the ECB 
yesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone .  Do you think that such actions 
to ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pres sure on the Fed to do the 
same?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic —
their mandates are domestic , and they ’re focused on economic conditions from a domesti c 
standpoint.  And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all 
central banks .  So that ’s our principal focus.  So it could cut either way.  You know, I would 
think that , to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB  
after a rate cut, that would support —tend to support activity.3  So we ’re really focused on, you 
know, the risks to our —on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the 
risks to those outlooks.  That ’s our principal focus. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  This is the first time that you ’ve been really issuing 
SEPs in an era when rates are going to be going down.  Just two sort of related question s:  Is 
there concern that you ’ll be causing a sort of “ dot deflation ” by telling people, “W ell, don’ t buy 
your car now , because it ’ll get cheaper in six months because we’ re cutting rates, ” and that that 
could sort of fulfill itself ?  And , secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected 
PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility 
in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target?  
                                                 
3 Chair Powell intended to say “stronger activity in the euro area.”  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 22  
 CHAIR POWELL.   I’ll take th e inflation one first.  I didn’ t quite follow your “ dot” 
question. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well , the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to—
Howard Schneider with Reuters —went from 1.8 to 1.5, it ’s the fact that you ’re not responding to 
that. 
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s the inflation question. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Yes.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I’m saying you — 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  On de f—no, the fact that you ’ve signaled rate cuts are 
coming .  Or is—was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell 
people , “Don’t borrow now, don’ t spend now , because rates will get cheaper later ”? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I see.  Okay , right.  Okay .  So let me let me answer the inflation 
question first.  So we ’re saying that we know —I noted in the statement and also in my —what I 
said here.  We saw that market -based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens , dropped.  
We noted that also in the statement.  And I noted it as a reason for us to —one of several reasons 
why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.  So we find that 
notable.  Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this  year, among FOMC participants , 
dropped a couple of tenths.  So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.  
Let me say , on inflation, it ’s something I ’ve been concerned about for quite a long time.  
It’s one of the principal reasons why I called fo r the review .  In a world where policy rates are 
going to be closer to the effective lower bound, t hen, just as a general matter, we need to be 
really strong on 2 percent inflation.  So I think, you know, we certainly don ’t want to be seen as 
weak on infla tion, and I don't believe we are.  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 22  
 In terms of the dots, you’ re right , this is the first time , I believe, we ’ve had —we’ve talk ed 
about cutting in the “ dot era. ”  I guess the dot era began in January 2012.  And, you know, we ’re 
working our way through it.  A nd I think it ’s just something we do.  You know  that my view on 
the dots is that they , overall , provide useful information for people , but that we need to do our 
absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not.  
Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they ’re not discussed or debated 
at the meeting, they ’re an input to policy more than an output of policy , and they ’re also only the 
most likely case.  So , in a situation where there ’s relatively high uncertainty, the re’s the most 
likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely.  But that doesn ’t 
show up in the dot.  The dot is either one thing or it ’s another.  So I just would say that , if you 
pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture. 
CHRISTOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. 
Chairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there ’ll be a debate over 
whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points.  Indeed , there’ s a pretty substantial body of academic 
literature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more 
aggressively than it otherwise would.  I’m w ondering what you think of that prescription, and if 
you could spe nd a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50  basis point cut and 
how you approach that question. 
CHAIR POWELL.  On the specific question of that , that ’s just something we haven ’t 
really engaged with yet , and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 22  
 picture as we move forward.  So it would be —so nothing I can say about that is specific to the 
near-term question that we face.  
More generally , though, the research you refer to essentially notes that , in a world where 
you are closer to the effective lower bound, i t’s why —research kind of shows this —it’ s wise to 
react , for example, to prevent a weakening from  turning into a prolonged weakening .  In other 
words, sort of , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  So  I think that is a valid way to 
think about policy in this era.  I don ’t know —and it ’s always in the —I think it ’s in the minds of 
policymakers, you know, during this era, because it ’s well understood to be correct.  Again, I 
don’t know what that means in t erms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward.  That ’s 
going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data  and the evolving risk picture. 
DONNA BORAK.   Donna Borak with CNN.  Thanks , Chairman Powell.   Democratic 
presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in 
order to address concerns about rising trade deficits .  The President himself has routinely 
complained about the strength of the U.S. dollar , saying i t has resulted in , quote, “tremendous ,” 
close quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others.  Do you think that an 
overvalued dollar has been a drag on America’s global competitiveness?  And would you support 
an intervent ion of some kind on this issue?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy , not 
the Fed, and we don’t comment , in that sense , on the level of the dollar.  We have the 
responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use ou r tools to achieve that.  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 22  
 Of course, we do that through changing financial conditions , and one of those is the dollar, but 
we don’t target the dollar.  It’s just something that we don’t do.  
In fact, central banks —or, rather , nations , when they get together , routinely adopt a 
communique that says we will target our domestic , economic , and financial conditions and not 
our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the 
G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago.  So I’m not the right person to ask about that 
sort of dollar policy intervention. 
PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones.  If the 
most —according to the dot plot, I mean —if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates 
in the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react 
sooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now?  Why 
not just cut them now?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, why not now?  And, I would say , there was not much support for 
cutting rates now at this meeting.  There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate 
cuts.  But all of those , but apparently one , felt that it would be better to see more to —before 
moving.  And I gave a co uple of reasons why that is the case.  First , it’s just the fact that some of  
these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain.  So we felt that it 
would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would , in fact , learn a lot about 
these developments in the near term.  Ultimately, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves 
is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?  And we will act as needed, 
including promptly , if that’s appropriate , and use our tools to expand—to sustain the expansion. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Yes.  Thank you for doing this, Chairman.  Edward Lawrence 
from Fox Business Network.  How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in?  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 22  
 You know, on one hand, you have str ong overall growth.  C onsumer spending is strong.  On the 
other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in  jobs but coming 
in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation.  And then, specifically, what data are you 
looking  at that you decided not to have a rate cut?  Why didn’t you do that?  [0:24:15.5]  
CHAIR POWELL.   Well, you gave a pretty good picture.  I mean, it’s a complicated 
picture , and , you know , the answer is , we look at all of it.  But I would say , the big pieces of it 
are this :  The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer 
spending coming back up in the second quarter .  That is coming true.  And consumer spending is 
at a healthy level , and that makes sense.  You’ve  got a tight labor market.  You’ve got companies 
in surveys saying that labor is scarce.  You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are 
plentiful.  You’ve got wages going up.  You’ve got high levels of  household confidence.  So, all 
of that , underlyin g fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy , which is 
70 percent of the economy , is quite solid.  Job creation, if you take a three -month average , is still 
well above, you know, the entry —level of entry into the workforce.  So that part of  the economy 
is solid.  
You mentioned manufacturing , and we’re seeing this all around the world.  
Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker.  It’s not solely a domestic issue , and it 
may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing  to that, including, for example, what 
China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage.  Some of it 
may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments.  The Boeing 737 issues 
may be contributing in their  own way .  So the re—lower oil prices are contributing to lower 
investment , although they’re also leading to lower gas prices , which support s spending.  So there 
are many, many things.  There isn’t any one thing that explains it all.  But it’s something tha t 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 22  
 we’re watching.  But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of 
weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to 
low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of t he two big pieces of it that 
you see.  
Then you see the crosscurrents .  If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that —concerns 
about global growth and trade developments —you have the full picture.  And I think what that 
picture —what we took away from that pic ture is that we’d like to see more, that we do see these 
risks , and what we want to do is , we want  to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon 
the outlook. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and R adio.  If consumer 
spending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I’d like to get your 
thinking on what a Fed rate cut would do?  Have you modeled the additional growth and 
inflation you might get from a rate cut?  Can you identi fy any sectors that would benefit from a 
lower cost of capital ?  Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we have the tools we have , and we’re committed and sworn to 
use them to support economic activity .  And they do support economic activity through a number 
of channels that are reasonably well understood— some more directly tied to interest rates than 
others.  But we do generally believe that —that our interest rate policy can support demand and 
support business investment as well.  And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as 
appropriate to achieve our objective s, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just 
make a note of that.  
The reason why we say “ sustain the expansion”  is, you’re see ing now , for the first time, 
you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn’t 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 22  
 been earlier.  You’re 10 years deep into this , and that’s something we heard quite a lot at the 
conference in Chicago on the review .  And I just would say , that’s why we think —it’s one of the 
reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really 
are benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time.  
MICHAEL M CKEE.   But g iven your description of the crosscurrents, do you think Fed 
policy can solve those problems?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we take the— you know , we take the crosscurrents as a given , and 
we have our tools.  You know, we don’t —we react to anything in princ iple that could undermine 
our achievement of our dual -mandate goals —maximum employment, stable prices —is worthy of 
our attention and can call forth a policy response.  And that’s just how we look at it. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Y ou’ve said that the Fed doesn’t 
take short -term political considerations into account, and you’ve defended the Fed’ s 
independence.  So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that , publicly or 
privately , you should push back on the President’s  criticisms rather than ignoring him?   And 
also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary 
policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know , I don’t —I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or 
privately , really .  So I would just say that we are —at the Fed , we’re deeply committed to 
carrying out our mission, a nd also that our independence from direct political control we see as 
an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well.  
NANCY MARS HALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, are you concerned that new digital currencies like Libra, which Facebook unveiled this 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 22  
 week , could undermine the Fed and erode your power to influence the economy?  And did 
anyone from Fa cebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central 
bank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that.  And, of course , the—so I think we’re a long 
way from that.  Digital currencies are in their infancy.  So, essentially, not too concerned about, 
you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of 
cryptocurrencies or digital currencies.  
You know, Facebook, I believ e, has made quite broad rounds in —around the world really 
with regulator s, supervisors , and lots of people to discuss their plans , and that certainly includes 
us.  And we’re —you know, it’s something we’re looking at.  We meet with a broad range of 
private -sector firms all the time on financial technology , and there’s just a tremendous amount of 
innovation going on out there.  You know, there are potential benefits here .  There are also 
potential risks , particularly of a currency that could, you know, that c ould potentially have large 
application.  So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having 
quite high expectations , from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do 
decide to go forward with something . 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Do you think the Fed will be  involved in regulating 
Libra then?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we have —we don’t have plenary authority over 
cryptocurrencies as such.  They play into our world through consumer protection and money 
launde ring and things like that.  But , I would say that, you know, through international forums, 
you know, we have significant input into the payment system  and, as you know , play an 
important role in the payment system here in the United States.  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 22  
 GREG ROBB.  Tha nk you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I want to 
take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy.  And something 
interesting, I think, is developing , is that outside experts are excited and  are—like the idea of the 
Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent —around there , roughly , I guess.  They think 
that that would, you know, help monetary policy , and that there ’s no—2 percent is not , like , 
sanctimonious or anything , or whatever , sacred.  It seems that you ’ve taken that off the table.  So 
I was wondering if you could discuss that .  Have you taken it off the table ?  And then, if so , why , 
or—and what ’s your thoughts on that ?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.   We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’ t look at raising the tar get rate 
for inflation.  We did say that.  And the reason is , it’s become a global norm , 2 percent .  Our 
statutory mandate is price stability.  And so we ’re actually taking a less —we’re looking at less 
radical ideas , such as how to make the 2 percent infla tion objective more credible.  
This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in 
particular.  So it ’s a new thing for us .  It’s something that —I thought it was both appropriate and 
important for us to do.  It ’ll be a yearlong , or even longer , process , looking at our strategy , tools , 
and communications.  And it ’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, 
and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve.  We ’ve had a series of Fed 
Listens  around the country at every Reserve Bank,  and we had an academic conference earlier 
this month , with seven papers written and criticized , and leading global experts.  
But I ’ll just say , again , that the heart of the conference was the two panels on —with 
practitioners in low and moderate income —who live in low - and moderate -income communities 
and are part of those communities.  And they were —there, I think, people were quite struck by 
their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum  employment is 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 22  
 and what it means in their communities.  You know, the idea being , they haven ’t had, you know, 
a bull market in these communities.  They haven ’t had , just , a booming economy.  What they 
have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.  And just now , you have, you know, 
companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the —providing opportunities for 
people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time. 
And that is , I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing 
and motivating , too.  So I think everybody thought, you know, that ’s—that was really quite 
worth doing.  I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should—s ome people 
recommended that we just talk to, you know , econ Ph .D.’s about this, but , no, that ’s not what we 
chose to do, and we ’re glad this is the choice we made.  
GREG ROBB.  But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, 
they—when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind 
of shrugged their shoulders, you know?  So—is 4 percent inflation radical ?  And to who?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I don ’t think it’ s—I don’ t think it’ s a practical alternative.  And I ’ll 
tell you why.  I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world.  You see central banks 
having a hard time getting inflation up to their —close to their objective.  We ’ve done better than 
other large central banks that are not, you know, open e conomies , like the U.K., where you have 
big currency moves that move inflation around.  So—but it ’s quite challenging to get inflation —
it’s been —even with very high level s of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not 
getting back up to tar get in  a sustained , symmetric kind of a way.  So saying that you’ re going to 
go for 4 percent —I wonder how credible that will be. 
JOHN HELTMAN.   John Heltman with American Banker.   I have a question about the 
Fed’s—or, I guess , the b ank r egulators ’ leverag ed lending guidance from 2013.  As you know, 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 22  
 the GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule , and it sort of went away.  But yet 
leveraged lending is a source of concern .  You yourself have said that credit  underwriting quality 
seems to be deteriorating somewhat lately , and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to 
prevent leverage d lending from becoming too much of an issue.  I want to know what the —is the 
2013 guidance still representative of the , sort of , Fed’s thinking about lever aged lending?  And 
does the Fed have any intent —intention to either issue , like , a leveraged lending rule or a new 
guidance that is less problematic ?  Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as 
you’re—as you  are? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So the 2013 guidance is not binding , and that ’s what came out of the 
GAO review.  But that ’s really the beginning of this —of the story.  You know, we have the 
authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure.  So, this —the first 
thing you star t with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves 
through their portfolio, through the risks that they ’re running and the pipeline —you know, the 
obligations that they ’ve undertaken to underwrite deals.  And so we monitor that  very 
carefully —so do the banks —and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before 
the crisis.  And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests .  We impose very large 
losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what  that is , whereas before the crisis, 
there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be.  So that ’s where it starts for 
us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running —you know, running on their own books 
and to themselves and t o each other.  So, in that, I feel —I feel like that is —that’s in a good place , 
but we never —we never  say “Mission accomplished”  on that.  We will keep— you know, keep 
monitoring that carefully.  
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 22  
 What ’s happened, though, is , the paper  is now owned by market -based vehicles :  
collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds , and things like that.  And so we now have —you 
know, we have a good sense of , domestically , of where that paper is.  I think, internationally , not 
as much , and the Financial S tability Board is actually looking more carefully at that.  And we —
you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are.  And they ’re actually pretty stably 
funded, in the  sense that there’ s no run risk, but  there’ s still macroeconomic risk.  And, y ou 
know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council , is looking at.  And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it ’s 
not really a financial stability risk , in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial 
system to do its job of intermediating credit.  
JOHN HELTMAN.  Is there any intention , is there any plan on the part of the Fed or 
other regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for , or—and  consistenc y, really —that’s 
the other point of guidance, right ?—is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the 
supervisory  expectations are for leveraged lending and for all —for anything , for that matter.  Is 
anything else coming?  Or is it just going to  remain kind of , like , bilateral kind of conversations 
with banks?  
CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the issue isn’ t that the banks don’ t understand what 
the rules are.  The issue is that the risk isn ’t in the banks.  It ’s in—it’s out in those market -based 
vehicles.  So  I don’ t, I don’t —you know, I no longer am day -to-day involved in this as I was 
before I took this job.  But my sense is , though, that that’ s really not the problem.  I’m not saying 
it’s perfect , but I think we do understand what risks the banks are runnin g.  And really the 
question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market -based vehicles that I 
mentioned, and what risks do they present ?  And we ’re very carefully assessing that.  And we 
June 19, 2019     Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 22  
 continue to take all these risks seriously.  You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few 
weeks ago, so.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.   Hi.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I ’m just wondering if you 
could expand a little bit on the labor market.  So the statement noted that the labor market still 
remains strong , but the May jobs report  that that we saw missed on estimates , but employment 
rates still stayed at 3.6 percent.  I ’m wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only 
got 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report.  What does that tell you about 
employment, and by all standards compared to, say , a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or 
farther away from full employment or maximum employment?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know , we have to be closer , because more jobs are being created 
than people a re entering the labor force.  The unemployment rate is lower.  You know, by just 
lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place.  You mentioned wages .  So the 
level of wages is very consistent with what it should be , in the  sense that it ’s approximately equal 
to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis.  So what ’s, I guess , a little surprising , 
though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late —you know, long into a cycle, 
let’s say , and not see even higher wages  that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this 
level, even though they ’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they ’re not growing 
at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation. 
So, you know, we watch —we watch  all of this very carefully , and I think we ’re very 
careful about not assuming that we ’re, you know, that would—that there ’s no more slack in the 
labor market.  You know, we ’ve all lived through —you know, when I got to the Fed, we we re in 
the 8 percent –plus range , and it ’s just gone down and down and down, and you haven’ t seen 
wages picked up.  You haven’ t seen real signals that we’re at maximum employment.  You have

Page 22 of 22  
 seen a tightening labor market.  You know, it —the surveys that  I men tioned will all show that 
the labor market has  tightened , but not overtightened. 
JEAN YUNG.   Hi, Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask—did the FOMC 
discuss a  change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting , perhaps ending runoffs earlier than 
planned?  And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates 
before September?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, we haven’t made any decisions yet.  Balance sheet 
runoff is very close to the end of its planned life.  I would say this :  If we do provide more 
accommodation —again, we haven’t really addressed this —but if  we do provide more 
accommodation, we’ll certainly keep in mind what we said earl ier this year , which is that we’ll 
always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so tha t it serves our dual -mandate objectives.  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
July 31, 2019  
 
CHAIR POWELL.   Good afternoon, and welcome.  We decided today to lower the target 
for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2 ¼ percent.   The 
outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable , and this action is designed to support that 
outlook.  It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade 
policy uncertainty , to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the  economy , 
and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.  All of these 
objectives will support achievement of our overarching goal:  to sustain the expansion, with a 
strong job market and inflation close to our objective , for the benefit of the American people.   
We also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in 
September , as previously planned.  And I ’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate 
reduction and then turn to t he path forward.  
As the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place.  The 
unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent 
objective for nine months.  Our interest rate target was at the low  end of estimates of neutral.  
Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed 
unemployment to near a half -century low.  Wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying 
jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us that many who 
have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their 
lives.  This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job 
market r eaches more of those left behind.

 Through the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted 
inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest 
rates.  The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about 
any changes and then to today’s action.  The median Committee participant’s assessments of the 
neutral rate of interest and the longer -run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this 
year, reinf orcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate.  These changes in the 
anticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the 
economy.  
At our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the 
federal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall 
direction of events.  Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments.  Job 
growth was strong in June and, looking through month- to-month fluctuations, the data point to 
continued strength.  We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe 
is required to hold the unemployment rate steady.  
GDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations.  Consumption—
supported by rising incomes and high household confidence —is the main engine driving the 
economy forward.  But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and 
business fixed investment fell in the second quarter.  Foreign growt h has disappointed, 
particularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China.  In response to this 
weakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or 
contemplating doing so.  After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled 
over in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer.  Looking through this 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 23  
 variability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies 
more cautious about their capital s pending.  
The domestic inflation shortfall has continued.  Core inflation, which excludes food and 
energy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at 
1.6 percent over the past 12 months.  We continue to expect tha t inflation will return over time to 
2 percent.  But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures 
persist.  Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation.  
We are mindful that inflation’s return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued 
below -target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult -to-reverse downward slide in 
longer -term expectations.  
So taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook.  
Over the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and 
muted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy 
interest rate that would best support that outlook.  Today, we judg e that those factors warrant the 
policy adjustment I described :  “As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target 
range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming 
information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a 
strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.”  
Thank you.  I am happy to take your questions.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times .  Per 
your statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point 
cut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target ?  And, if not, 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 23  
 what are you going to be looking at to convince y ou that you need to cut rates again?  What is 
the hurdle rate there?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I think you have to look at not just the 25 ba sis point cut, but look 
at the C ommittee ’s actions over the course of the year .  As I noted in my opening statement, we 
started off expecting some rate increases , we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and 
now we ’ve moved here .  I think what you ’ve seen over the course of the year is , as we ’ve moved 
to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed ju st about as expected 
with that gradually increasing support .  And I think— I wouldn’ t take credit for all of that, but I 
do think that increasing policy support  has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook 
favorable . 
In terms of the rest of your quest ion, the C ommittee is really thinking of this as a way of 
adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I 
mentioned:   to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy , that  those 
factors are —where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation.  
So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we ’re thinking of it as essentially in the 
nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  There’ s a 
perception out there  that perhaps , in this case , the F ed is something of a hammer in search of a 
nail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don’ t seem to show any 
kind of demand problem in the U.S.  A nd when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates, 
they’ve all come down .  And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, you’ re absolutely right .  The —the  performance  of the economy 
has been reasonably good.  The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it ’s been 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 23  
 in a long time, and the outlook is also good.  What we’ ve been monitoring since the beginning of 
the year is , effectively , downside risks to t hat outlook from weakening global growth, and we see 
that everywhere:   weak manufacturing, weak global growth now , particularly in the European 
Union and China .  In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been 
disruptive and then ha ve been less so, and also inflation running below target .  So we see those 
as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support 
them and keep that outlook favorable .  And , frankly, it is a continuation of what we ’ve been 
doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks. 
MICHAEL  MCKEE .  But the follow -up question is, how does it  do that?  How does 
cutting interest rates lower —or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going , since the cost of  
capital doesn ’t seem to be the issue here?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I —I really think it does , and I think the evidence of my 
eyes tells me that our policy does support —it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, 
household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand.  So it will lower 
borrowing costs .  It will—and it will work .  And I think you see it .  Since— you know, since we 
noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you 
saw—I won ’t take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up.  You 
see confidence, which had troughed in June —you saw it move back up.  You see economic 
activity on a healthy basis .  It just—it seems to work through confide nce channels as well as the 
mechanical channels that you are talking about.  
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from t he Washington Post .  You always say that 
the F ed is data dependent, and much of the data that we ’ve seen since the June meeting has 
surprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations .  Can you give us a sense of how 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 23  
 that better -than-expected data impacted the FOMC ’s thinking ?  And if we keep seeing these 
upside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, yes .  I mean , I think we —of course, you know, what we do at 
every meeting, as I noted, is , we do a deep dive into U.S . economic activity and global activity 
and, certainly , carefully went through U.S . economic activity, which there has  been some 
positive and some negative, but , overall , the U.S . economy has shown resilience during the 
intermeeting period.  But, again, the —the  issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall 
in inflation, and we ’re trying to address those . 
So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we ’re going to be monitoring those same 
things .  We ’ll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low 
inflation .  And we ’ll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S . econo my.  As I 
mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we ’ll be putting all of that 
together , and that ’s how we ’ll be thinking about policy going forward.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman , CNBC .  I just want to follow up on that .  Would 
you say we ’re sort of— you guys have gotten into a new regime here?  This is sort of an 
insurance cut and not a data -dependent cut ?  And are we now more in the realm of watching 
headlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers , or—and 
growth numbers?  What —how do we know what you’ re going to do next , and why now in this 
new regime?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to i nsure 
against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions .  So that is —in 
a sense, that is a risk -management point, and that is a bit of insurance .  But we also feel like 
weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S . economy .  You see it 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 23  
 now in the second quarter :  You see weak investment , you see weak manufacturing —so support 
demand there  and also to support return of inflation to  2 percent .  But there ’s definitely an 
insurance aspect of it . 
Trade is unusual .  We don ’t—you know, the thing is, there isn’ t a lot of  experience in 
responding to global trade tensions .  So it is a —it’ s something that we haven’ t faced before and 
that we ’re learning by doing .  And it is not —it’ s not exactly the same as watching global growth , 
where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal 
policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle .  With trade tensions —
which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the 
economy —they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them . 
And, by the way, I want to be clear here.  We play no role whatsoever in assessing or 
evaluating trade policies other than as —as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S . 
economy in the short and medium te rm.  We ’re not in any way criticizing trade policy .  That ’s 
really not our job.  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  So, Chair 
Powell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates :  a lower neutral rate that 
may have made policy a little bit tighter than anticipated, the global slowdown and the darker  
risk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re -center inflation and inflation 
expectations .  I wonder, which of those fac tors, if any, weighs most heavily on you?  A nd, more 
importantly, is a ¼ point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I actually think different people have different —different  
weightings has been my experien ce on those things .  You mentioned lower r* , trade slowdown—
and I would actually add,  lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 23  
 kind of point to more accommodation.  So, again, I don ’t think asking about a ¼ point is really 
the ri ght question.  I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the 
Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to , now , a rate cut . 
So I think we ’ve been providing —and that a ffects the forward rate path, and it affects 
financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy .  You see an economy which is 
actually performing pretty well .  Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was 
in all of ’ 18 and actually a little better than our forecast  for growth in 2019 —at the end of 2019.  
So I think, in a way , that ’s monetary policy working .  And , again, I wouldn ’t just look at the 
25 basis point cut as the right question. 
NICK TIMIRAOS .  If I could follow up, I guess in May —in May  it seemed as if you 
were setting a higher bar to cut rates :  There would need to be a deterioration i n the outlook.  In 
June, you seemed to suggest that if the outlook didn’ t improve, there might be a rate cut .  Where 
is that bar right now , because I think there ’s some co nfusion about how the C ommittee is 
responding.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So we, as we noted —we noted at the bottom of the statement 
that language, which really says how we ’re thinking about it .  So it says , as we’re contemplating 
the future path of the target r ange for the federal funds rate, we ’ll continue to monitor the 
implications of incoming information —and it talks  about that language .  So, you know, I can ’t—
all I can tell you is, we ’ll be looking at weak global growth.  We ’ll be looking very carefully to 
see how that ’s happening. 
And I think you see —you learn —every cycle you learn about these things .  So we will 
see whether growth is picking up, whether it ’s bottoming out .  We ’ll see that picture .  We ’ll also 
see on trade.  Y ou know, we ’re going to be seeing —I think we ’ve learned a lot on trade in this 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 23  
 cycle .  I think we ’ll continue to learn more , and on inflation we will .  So, in addition, the U.S . 
economy itself is —the performance of the U.S . economy will enter into that .  So I would love to 
be more p recise, but with trade , it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way .  Those 
are the things that we ’ll be looking at, and— you know, in  making our decisions going forward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network.  So a rate hike 
last December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis F ed president, James Bullard, as a 
step too far.  Now the F ed’s waited about seven months for a rate cut .  You said today you were 
concerned about downside risks .  So could some of the weakn ess on the business side , with that 
fixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side , be because the F ed waited so long ?  I 
want to get your thoughts on that  and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So we don’ t hear that from businesses .  They don’ t come in and 
say, “We’re not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high.”   I haven ’t heard 
that from a business .  What you hear is that demand is weak for their products .  You see 
manufacturing being weak all over the world.  Investment —business investment is weak.  A nd I 
wouldn’ t lay all of that at the door of trade talks .  I think there ’s a—there’s a  global business 
cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that ’s—tha t’s been, you know, 
definitely a bigger factor than , certainly , we expected late last year .  I think global —global  
growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent .  
And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we 
antic ipated.  
In terms of , is this the —we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it’ s—we 
think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned .  And I ’ve already gone over how we ’re 
thinking about going forward.  
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 23  
 ANN SAPHIR .  Ann Saphir  with Reuters.  You called it “ a midcycle adjustment to 
policy .”  And, I mean, what should we take this to mean, and what message do you mean to send 
with this move today about future rate moves?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, the sense of that is —I mean , that refers back to other times 
when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle .  And I’m contrasting it there with the 
beginning —for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle.  
ANN SAPHIR .  So we’re not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle?  
CHAIR POWELL .  That is not —that ’s not what we ’re seeing now .  That ’s not our 
perspective now or outlook. 
JAMES POLITI .  Hi there .  Are there any circumstances under which you would decide 
to pause —pause  at one interest rate cut, today ’s interest rate cut , and not —not , not go ahead with 
further monetary easing at this stage ?  Or are you predicting that, you know, once you’ ve 
embarked on this easing , you will have to at least move by one more notch going f orward?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so our policy is —will depend on the implications of 
incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook.  A nd so we ’re 
going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the out look, as I mentioned.  
And, s o I—that ’s really where I would leave you with that.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi .  Victoria Guida with Politico .  On capital, Vice Chairman 
Quarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exist s right now are such that it’ s 
basically like the counter cyclical capital buffer is already turned on , and that he would like the 
ability to be able to turn it down in a downturn.  I was wondering if you agreed with that . 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 23  
 And then, also, just quickly , on real -time payments —larger banks have suggested that if 
the F ed built its own system , that would be  a bait -and-switch , because the F ed asked —or called 
for a private -sector system .  Do you think that that is a fair assessment?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Okay .  So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital 
requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right .  I do agree with that .  
The idea that you ’re talking about is one that ’s—that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about .  It’s 
a—it’s one under consideration.  The idea being , in a sense , we’ve chosen, in the United States, 
to have high through -the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI  surcharge, which is the 
surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirem ents.  We ’ve, in effect , already put 
in place substantial countercyclical buffers .  And so, conceptually , you can think of —I’m not 
saying it’ s the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer . 
So that ’s—that’s really the point —is that we don’ t rely —our s ystem doesn ’t rely on our 
ability —it doesn’ t mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a 
countercyclical tool .  We rely on through- the-cycle, always -on high capital and liquidity 
requirements .  And I think that ’s a good thing to do.  The idea of putting it in place so you can 
cut it, that’ s something some other jurisdictions have done, and it ’s worth considering .  I think 
the United Kingdom , in particular , has a  countercyclical capital buffer that’ s always on , but the 
one point of it is that you can cut when there ’s a downturn and therefore give the banks more 
room .  So this isn ’t something we ’ve decided to do.  It’s just under consideration. 
In terms of the real -time payment system, your second question, so this is something 
we—the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real -time payments 
available to the general public.  The F ed, really, coming out of the Reserve System —the Reserve 
Banks and the Board together —convened all of the stakeh olders around the table to talk about 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 23  
 how we can move forward.  This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card 
companies —pretty much all of the groups who would be interested—and worked on a project for 
several years .  And one of the things tha t came out of that  was a recommendation that the Fed 
should build a 24 x  7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem—to address that 
problem . 
We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we 
got quite a  lot of comments .  They were overwhelmingly favorable .  And I would point out that 
in our payment system, in many places, the F ed operates alongside private -sector operators —for 
example, in wholesale payments , in ACH, and in check—so it wouldn’ t be unusual  or out of 
keeping with —with  how we ’ve done things in the past .  We have not made a decision on this, 
but it ’s something we ’re looking at carefully and something I do expect we ’ll make a decision 
on soon. 
CRAIG TORRES .  Craig Torres from Bloomberg .  I’m trying to parse what you ’re 
saying here .  On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial 
conditions , and that ’s helping the economy .  In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this 
language , “will act as appropriate ,” as still being in the statement.  And , on the other hand, you 
say it ’s not the start of a —of an easing cycle.  So what are you saying?  Does that mean, you 
know, with one or two more cuts you’ ll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement ?  
Or simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants 
think?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So it is —as I mentioned, it ’s going to depend on the evolving data 
and the evolving risk picture .  But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we 
see is that it’ s appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 23  
 stance.  That ’s what we ’re seeing .  And that ’s what we ’re going to be looking —you know, we ’ll 
be looking at incoming data, at all of the —at the risks that I mentioned , and the performance of 
the U.S . economy , and at low  inflation .  We’ll be looking at that to make our decisions going 
forward.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr .  Chairman .  Scott Horsley for NPR .  You ’ve talked 
a number of times about the people who feel like they are just rece ntly getting to the punchbowl 
10 years into this expansion.  Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to 
help them?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I think the best thing for people who are —who a re feeling 
that—and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low - and moderate -
income communities to the effect that they ’re now feeling the recovery , and, in fact , they haven’ t 
felt a better labor market in anybody ’s memory , so this is great to hear .  And I guess my view is , 
the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that ’s one 
of the overarching goals of —of this move and all of our policy moves .  There really is no reason 
why the expan sion can ’t keep going .  Inflation is not troublingly high.  If you look at the —at the 
U.S. economy right now, there ’s no sector that ’s booming and therefore might bust .  You have a 
fairly well -balanced, in a sense, economy . 
Now, the engine , though,  is real ly a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the 
economy .  The manufacturing economy —the investment and manufacturing part of the 
economy —is more or less not —not  growing much .  It’s at a healthy level but not growing much .  
So—and we hope to help that with this rate cut.  But, I would say , overall , we’re trying to sustain 
the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum 
employment and stable prices.  
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 23  
 DONNA BORAK.  Chairman Powell , Donna Borak with CNN.  The President has 
repeatedly called for this rate hike and for the Fed to end the runoff of its balance sheet.  What do 
you say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today?  And could you 
also elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decide d to speed up its balance sheet runoff two 
months earlier today?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I gave my —my reasons for —our reasons , really —for doing this .  
And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to i nsure against downside 
risks to the out look from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that 
those factors are already having, and promote a faster return  of inflation to  2 percent.  That’s 
what we’ve been talking about all year long, and we’ve gradually moved our pol icy in the 
direction of more accommodation.  I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to 
that.  So that’s what we’re doing, and that’s why we’re doing it.  
We never take into account political considerations.  There’s no place in our discuss ions 
for that.  We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.  We 
conduct monetary policy in order to—to  move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and 
that’s what we’re always going to do.  We’re always going to use our tools that way .  And then, 
at the end, we’ll —you know, we’ll live with the results.  
In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency.  
Really nothing more to it than that.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  G reg Robb from MarketWatch.  I was 
wondering —we weren’t in the room, but I think it’s a fair assumption to know that the two 
dissenters probably spoke about financial stability concerns.  So I was wondering if you could 
talk about what you—what was your res ponse to them when those concerns were raised ?  I’ve 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 23  
 collected a couple of things from the IMF , and the Bank of International Settlements said that it’s 
just—when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there’s also this 
feeling  that it makes it harder to raise rates.  So could you talk about that?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So, first , let me say —I’ll just speak for myself, but I 
understand those concerns very well.  I do.  I’ve —you know, I’ve studied them, I’ve spoken 
about them, and I take them very seriously.  But as I look at today’s situation, I don’t see them as 
a reason not to take this action today.  I just don’t think—that would be my point.  And one of 
the reasons why I think that is , if you look—if you look—so  we have a financial stability 
framework now for the first time.  Before the crisis, we didn’t have this, but now we have it, and 
we publish it.  And we look at , really , four big things so that we know we can— you know, the 
public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting , and—you know, and see 
whether we got this right , because it’s transparent now. 
But the four things we look at are valuation pressures .  And we do see notable valuation 
pressures in some markets but , you know, honestly , not at a highly troubling level.  In terms of 
household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing .  Households are in 
a very good shape overall.  I’ll come back to business borrowing.  Leverage in the financial 
system is low, and funding risk is low.  So, overall, staff’s view has been— and my view has 
been —that if you look overall , financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate.  
The place that gets all the attention right now —a lot of attention —is business borrowing, 
and we look very car efully at that.  What’s happening with business borrowing is , the loans have 
moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market -based vehicles, which tend to be 
stably funded.  B ut, nonetheless, it’s clear that the highly leveraged business sector c ould act as 
an amplifier to a downturn.  So we’re watching that very carefully.  But , again, I think if you 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 23  
 look overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience—much higher 
than it was before the crisis —and that’s something  to take comfort from.  And I think all of that 
gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and 
regulatory tools to —you know, to keep the financial system resilient. 
GREG ROBB.  So you’re not doing something today f or—to help today, and then it’s 
going to cause problems down the road?  Y ou’re not worried about that kind of dynamic?  
CHAIR POWELL.  There are very few things that I don’t worry about at all.  So, of 
course, of course, we monitor.  We have—every quarter w e have an extensive briefing on 
financial stability, and we had that yesterday.  So we look at this on an ongoing basis.  We have a 
great team.  We liaise with central banks around the world.  You know, one of my colleagues is 
the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we’re very, very much monitoring these 
things all the time.  And we worry about them all the time.  We’re always looking at the —we’re 
looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time.  But the things we haven’t 
missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking 
monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger, AP.  You’ve talked in this press 
conference about be ing data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of 
rate cuts.  But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and 
they’re predicting three, four cuts this year.  Is this your effort to try to damp down that —that  
thing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No .  Let me be clear.  What I said was , it’s not —it’s not the 
beginning of a long series of rate cuts.  I didn’t —I didn’t  say it ’s just one or anything like that.  
What I said is, when you think about rate -cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 23  
 Committee is not seeing that—not seeing us in that place.  You would do that if you saw real 
economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot.  That’s not 
what we’re seeing.  That’s not what we’re seeing.  
What we’re seeing is that it’s appropriate to —to adjust policy to a somewhat more 
accommodative stance over time, and that’s how we’re looking  at it.  What I said was , it’s not a 
long cutting cycle —in other words , referring to what we do when there’s a recession or a very 
severe downturn.  That’s —that’s  really what I was ruling out.  I think, if you look back at other 
midcycle adjustments , you’l l see— you know, I don’t know that they’ll be , in the end, 
comparable or not, but you’ll see examples of these. 
DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times .  You mentioned the difficulty of assessing 
trade tensions in  the economic outlook.  Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.–China 
trade conflict was in the Fed’s decision to cut rates ?  And if the current stalemate and the threat 
of more tariffs continue , what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So, you know, I wouldn’t bring it down to any one trade thing or any 
one factor.  I think we look at a broad range of factors , and trade uncertainty —trade policy 
uncertainty is one of them .  That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn’t —I 
wouldn’t be able to tell you how much of it is due to that.  And without knowing —you know, I 
think we —with trade , we have to react to the developments, and we don’t know what they’ll be , 
and so it’s hard to exactly say.  Certainly, we’ve seen , though, that when there’s a s harp 
confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty 
quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly.  We saw that in June .  But then we saw them 
unwind after that , to some extent.  You’ve seen it returning to —to a much lower temperature, I 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 23  
 think.  Again, with—with  trade policy, we’re just going to be watching and trying to assess the 
implications for the —for the  U.S. outlook. 
DON LEE.  How much of an effect could the tariffs have?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small.  
They’re not large as it relates to the U.S. economy.  The real question is , what are the effects on 
the economy through the —through the  confidence channel —business confidence channel ?  And , 
again, very, v ery hard to tease that out.  I’ve seen some research, which —you know, which says 
that they are meaningful —meaningful effects on —on output .  That’s  to say , not trivial.  And I 
think that that sounds right, but it’s quite hard to get —there is no way to get a n accurate measure.  
You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it’s a factor, 
particularly businesses that have—manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross 
international borders will all tell you th at it’s been a challenge.  Many of them have made 
adjustments, and they’ve gotten to a place where it’s okay, but it’s —it’s  been a challenge.  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones News wires.  Thanks for the question, 
Chairman.  As the press conference —as this press conference has gone under  way, markets have 
declined .  The Dow is down as much as 400 points.  What I’m hearing is a reluctance to provide 
more guidance around the future path of rates.  And I’m wondering if that reflects a greater lack 
of consensus on the Committee .  And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see 
around these decisions , and how split are people about this?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, you’re right.  T here’s a range of views on the Committee, 
and—but the C ommittee is unifie d, completely unified on our dedication to making the best 
policy decisions that we can make .  And that means people have a responsibility to do their best 
thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.  
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 23  
 In terms of the way for ward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we 
laid that out in the —you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that’s the roadmap we’re going 
to be following going forward.  We’re going to be data dependent.  We’re going to be, as we 
always are, doing what we need to do—what we believe we need to do to support the economic 
expansion. 
JOHN HELTMAN.  Hi, John Heltman with American Banker .  So it’s been about 
18 months since the Fed issued its enforcement  action  against Wells Fargo.  And I w as 
wondering if you could characterize the progress that the bank has made towards the 
shortcomings that it had in its risk -management processes .  And I’m also curious whether their 
lack of a permanent CEO has hampered progress , in your eyes . 
CHAIR POWELL.   So the problems at  Wells Fargo —that arose at Wells Fargo around 
risk management and consumer —the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty 
deep, and I think the company realizes that .  And they’re not going to be fixed—they haven’t 
been fixed  quickly , and, frankly, we didn’t expect them to be fixed quickly.  So they’re —you 
know, they —they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to 
lift it, and that’s not something we’re considering doing right now.  And the Committee —I 
mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but , as I said, they’re deep -seated 
issues, and it just takes time to address them.  
I wouldn’t comment on the CEO question.  I don’t really have anything for you on that.  
JOHN HELTMAN.   I mean , I just —I’d like to  clarify , like , are you pleased with the 
responsiveness you’re getting from them?  Do you feel like this is going the way that you kind of 
wanted it to go?  
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 23  
 CHAIR POWELL.  I’m not going to characterize  it.  You know —I mean , I have  
characterized it.  We have—we have an enforcement action in place.  The company is working 
away at addressing it.  They take it seriously.  I think they do see it as we do, as something that 
has to go deep .  And, you know, we’ll lift the growth cap when w e’re satisfied.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  So when 
we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room —it will happen —the Fed will have less 
room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you’re cutting now.  How bi g of a problem will 
that be? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the premise is not —I will question your premise for a 
second.  If you remember  whether —again, one of the purposes of our —of our  cut today is to 
support the expansion.  A nd we don’t know when—and if it r eally works —if that works very 
well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don’t know where the —where the funds, 
in other cycles —and I don’t know whether this will happen or not , but in other cycles , the Fed 
wound up raising rates again after a mi dcycle adjustment.  Again, I’m not predicting that, but I 
don’t think that we know that we won’t have —that we’ll have less ammo because of these 
things.  That’s one thing.  So — 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   But you won’t be able to cut as much if —if rates are 
low.  I mean,  you will have —have  less ammo , in that sense.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, but you’re assuming that we would never raise rates again, that 
once we’ve cut these rates that they can never go back up again.  Just as a matter of principle, I 
don’t think tha t’s right.  In other —in other  long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have 
sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking —in fact , will cut—and 
then will go back to hiking.  Again, I don’t know whether that’ll happen right here.  It doesn’t 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 23  
 seem —it doesn’t seem like something that’s  in—you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we 
don’t know that. 
And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle , you—you do have a lot of benefits 
from that .  And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have .  A couple of rate hikes one 
way or the other isn’t going to matter so much if there is a downturn.  And you’re right, there 
will eventually be one.  We’ll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time 
comes.  
JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Jean Yung with MNI.  Can you give us an update on the ongoing 
reassessment of the inflation framework?  And have the discussions so far this year had any 
bearing on today’s decision?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the monetary policy review is really for —it’s really there to look 
at the way we make policy in the longer run.  It’s not something that enters directly into our 
discussions today.  We’ve had—so far we’ve had a series of meetings , called Fed Listens , at 
almost all the R eserve Banks.  Soon it will  be all the R eserve Banks.  And we meet there with the 
constituencies that we serve, and they’ve been very, very successful, hearing from people —not 
just—not just  economists, but people who are not economists , how —how  their lives interact 
with the Fed’s wo rk.  It’s been —it’s been great.  I ’ve got to say, it’s been even better than I 
hoped it would be. 
We’re just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we’re 
going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you 
know, the questions that we’re asking about our framework.  So it’s very early to say where 
that’s going, but, you know, we’re setting the table now and looking at what our framework is 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 23  
 and looking at how it’s performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world 
during the  Global F inancial C risis.  I expect we’ll be at this a while.  
I’m very excited about it.  I think it’s been a good exercise.  I think it’s opened us up to 
sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise.  And I think it’s a good time.  
You know, you have —10  years after the crisis, you’re really living in a new normal for the 
economy and monetary policy, and it’s a really good time to step back and ask whether there are 
some things that we  can do to improve our framework.  
COURTENAY BROWN.   Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Can you 
give us a sense of whether the C ommittee feels constrained at all by the market’s expectations 
for more cuts or other developments in financial markets?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I think this was —this was  well telegraphed.  What we did today 
was—was  very consistent with what we had said we were going to do.  I had mentioned the 
reasons for it.  They’ve been well telegraphed, and I think— you know, I think they  will—they 
will achieve their goals.  
We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that 
are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we’ve made this 
year have really worked.  Of course, we alw ays retain the flexibility to adjust our 
communications and our actions to —in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture , 
but—I’ll leave it there . 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Brian Che ung with Yahoo Finance.  Just to expand on that point 
about communication , I mean , we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with  regards 
to New York Fed P resident John Williams’s remarks before the blackout period.  So the Fed 
added language in the statement that says that the Committee is contemplating  the future path of 
July 31, 2019    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 23  
 the target range for the federal funds rate as it monitors implications .  I’m wondering—now 
there’s kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you’ve had 
to cut rates , outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a 
baseline.  So, just wondering if you can kind of clarify all those things within the context of the 
challenges of communicating it. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye ah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one.  And 
we do —we have had these global , really, risks to the outlook.  There really —there really  is 
nothing in the U.S. economy that presents a —you know, a prominent near -term threat to the U.S. 
economy.  As I mentioned, there’s no—there’s no segment that ’s really —or sector that’s really 
boiling over and overheating.  Nothing like that.  It’s —it’s  within —within the economy.  It’s —
it’s healthy , so I would say that.  Downside risks are really coming from abroad.  A nd, of course , 
we are concerned about —about  low inflation.  But —and , by the way, those risks from abroad are 
affecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment —fixed investment.  S o—
thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
 September 18 , 2019 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone, and welcome.   My colleagues at the 
Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.  We do this by steadfastly       
pursuing the goals Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.  We are 
committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis.  To day we 
decided to lower interest rates.  As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the U.S. 
economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against 
ongoing risks.  
The U.S. economy has continued to perform we ll.  We are into the 11th year of this 
economic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable.  The eco nomy grew at a 
2½ percent pace in the first half of the year.  H ousehold spending—support ed by a strong job 
market, rising incomes, and solid con sumer confidence —has been the key driver of growth.  In 
contrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output .  
The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments —two 
sources of uncertainty that we ’ve been monitoring all year.  
Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened , notably in Europe 
and China.  Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved.  
Trade policy tensions have waxed a nd waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. 
investment and exports.  Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that 
uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from  investing in  their businesses.  B usiness 
fixed inves tment posted a modest decline in the second quarter , and recent indicators point to 
continued softness.  Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with 
supportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate.  
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 26 
 As seen from FOMC participants ’ most recent projections , the median expectation for real GDP  
growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated 
longer -run value.  
The job market remains strong .  The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows  
for a year and a half, and  job gains have remain ed solid in recent months.  The pace of job gains 
has eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.   
Participation in the labor force  by people in their prime working years has been increasing.  And 
wages have been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - 
and middle -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now 
getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives.  This underscores , for us , the 
importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left 
behind.  We expect the job market to remain strong .  The m edian of participants’ projections for 
the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years.  
Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months 
through July, t otal PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation , which excludes volatile food 
and energy prices, w as 1.6 percent.  We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median 
projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021.1  However, inflation pressures clearly 
remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their 
historical ranges.  We are mindful that continued below -target inflation could lead to an 
unwelcome downward slide in longer -term inflation expectations.  
Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion 
of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent 
                                                 
1 Chair Powell intended to say that the median projection is 1.9 percent next year.

Page 3 of 26 
 objective as most likely.  While this has been our outlook for quite some time , our views about 
the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over 
the past year.  As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have 
weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks .  These factors, i n conjunction with muted  
inflation pressures , have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time 
toward a lower path for the federal funds rate , and this shift has supported the outlook.  Of 
course, this is the role of monetary poli cy—to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor 
market and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective.  
Today’s decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent , to 1.75  percent to 2 
percent , is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation 
pressures.  Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a 
resurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs.  The Fed has 
no role in the for mulation of trade policy, but we do take  into account anything that could 
materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals.  
The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what 
developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook.  We have often said that 
policy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today.  As I have noted, the  baseline  
economic outlook remains positive.  The projections of appropriate policy  show that participants 
generally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate  over the next couple of years .  
Of course, those views are merely forecasts and , as always,  will evolve with the arrival of new 
information. 
Let me say a few words about  our monetary policy operations.  Funding pressures in 
money markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 26 
 of its target range yesterday.  While these issues are important for market functioning and market 
partici pants, they  have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.  This 
upward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet 
corporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities.  To counter  these pressures, 
we conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today.  These temporary 
operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to 
move back into the target range.  In addition, as w e have done in the past, we made a technical 
adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis 
points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  In a related action, we also 
adjusted the r ate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the 
target range.  We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as 
necessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range.  Consistent 
with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves 
regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are 
not required.  
 To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment 
and stable prices.  As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the 
federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the 
econ omic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market 
and inflation near its symmetric 2  percent objective.  
Thanks .  I’ll be happy to take your questions.  
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 26 
 MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Pres s.  Mr. Chairman, 
when you cut rates in July, you characterized it as  a “midcycle adjustment .”  Is that still your 
view of what ’s happening?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we 
see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and 
inflation near our 2 percent objective .  And , by the way, that view is consistent with those of 
many other forecasters.  As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive 
economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate .  At the 
last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in , I guess , 1995 and 1998 as examples of such 
an approach, which was successful in both of those instances .  As our statement also highlights , 
though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade 
developments .  And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts 
could be appropriate .  We don’ t see that —it’s not what we expect —but we would certainly 
follow that path if it became appropriate .  In other words, as we say in our statement, we will 
continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure 
that the ex pansion remains on track.  
RICHARD MILLER.  [ Inaudible remark ]  I’m  sorry .  Rich Miller with Bloomberg .  
Taking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP,  I ’m just wondering what kind of 
message we should take from this.  Do you still —does the FOMC —is it safe to say the  FOMC 
still has an easing bias or not?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime 
practice, and we don ’t actually have that practice anymore, so I can ’t really adopt it right here .  
But, nonetheless, I ’ll respond to your question.  So we did—we made one decision today, and 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 26 
 that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point .  We believe that action is 
appropriate to promote our objectives, of course .  We’re going to be highly data dependent, as 
always.  Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the 
outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we ’re not on a preset course.  So that ’s how 
we’re going to look at it .  We’re going to be care fully looking at economic data .  Sometimes the 
path ahead is clear and sometimes less so .  So we ’re going to be looking carefully, meeting by 
meeting , at the full range of information, and we ’re going to assess the appropriate stance of 
policy as we go.  A nd, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.  
RICHARD MILLER.  If I could just follow up, you’ ve also said that the favorable 
outlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in tur n predicated 
on an outlook for F ed policy— in this case, further cuts .  Wouldn’ t that suggest that you should 
be inclined to—if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about, 
you should be inclined to cut?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, what we do going f orward is very much going to depend, Rich, 
on the flow of data and information.  We’ve seen —you know, if you look at the things we ’re 
monitoring, particularly global growth and trade development s, global growth has continued to 
weaken .  I think it ’s weaken ed since our last meeting .  Trade developments have been up and 
down and then up, I guess —or back up, perhaps —over the course of this intermeeting  period .  In 
any case, they ’ve been quite volatile .  So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now .  
We’re going to be watching that carefully.  We ’re also going to be watching the U.S . data quite 
carefully, and we ’ll have to make an assessment as we go.  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street 
Journal.  I know you’ re trying to speak for the C ommittee when you do these press conferences, 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 26 
 but the C ommittee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate 
policy path.  Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer  
crack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time 
that happens, you’ ll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn.  Where do you 
stand on this?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, 
you’re right .  Sometimes the —and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight 
years at the Fed, many times when the direction i s relatively clear and it ’s relatively  easy to reach 
unanimity.  This is a time  of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives.  And 
I really do think that ’s nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse 
perspectives , really .  So your question, though, is?  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  This is to your own view , because the data is, to some extent , lagged, 
especially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these 
risks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot 
today.  So, I w onder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management, 
which implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes.  S o I’ll try to get at that this way .  I think that the idea that if 
you s ee trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can—I think that ’s a 
good idea in principle , and I think history teaches us that it ’s better to be proactive in adjusting 
policy if you can. 
I think applying that principle in a particula r situation is where the challenge comes.  So I 
told you where  the C ommittee —the bulk of the Committee is going , meeting by meeting, and I 
think the main takeaway is that this is a C ommittee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly, 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 26 
 consistently , through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has  felt that it ’s 
appropriate .  At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were 
patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again.  And I think you’ ve seen u s being willing to 
move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture , and I have no reason to think that will 
change .  I think —but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend—data  includes the 
evolving risk picture .  That ’s where I am, and that ’s where I think the bulk of the C ommittee is.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr . Chairman, I wonder if  you’ re—oh, sorry.  Steve Liesman, 
CNBC.  I ’ve only done this a dozen —a lot of times .  I wonder if you’ re concerned about how the 
Federal Reserve operated through the re cent liquidity crunch in markets .  We talked to many 
traders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance .  There were several reports of 
people pointing to September as a potential crunch time .  You closed Monday at the top end of 
the fed funds  rate.  Tuesday came along, and ther e wasn ’t an operation until nine  o’clock  and no 
announcement until —of a second operation until four o’clock in the afternoon.  Was the F ed 
listening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the 
overnight rate at year -end and the turn of the year?  Are you concerned about how, for example, 
the New York F ed operated through this?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has 
more invested in carefully following the —you know, the behavior of these markets .  So, of 
course, we were well aware of the —you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the 
large bond purchases .  And, you know, we were very much waiting for that .  But we didn’ t 
expect —the response to that was stronger than we expected .  And, by the way, our sense is that it 
surprised market participants a lot , too.  You know , people were writing about this and 
publishing stories about it weeks ago .  It wasn ’t a surprise, but it was —it was  a stronger response 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 26 
 than—certainly than we expected .  So, no, I ’m not concerned about that , to answer your 
question.  I can go on a little bit about how we ’re looking at that .  Why don’ t I do that?  
So, as I mentioned, it doesn’ t—we don ’t see this as havin g any implications for the 
broader economy or for the economic outlook, n or for our ability to control rates .  The strains in 
the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I 
think most folks anticipated —strong demand for cash to purchase T reasuries and pay corporate 
taxes.  We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within 
the target range, and those measures were successful .  If we experience another episode of 
pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures.  We will not hesitate 
to use them . 
And since we ’re talking about this, let me take a step back and say this.  Earlier in the 
year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the C ommittee 
announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves regime.  And we ’ve 
been operating in that regime for a full decade .  We think it works well to implement our rate 
decisions .  The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered 
rates— the IOER and RRP rates—to keep the fed fund rates in the target range.  It ’s designed 
specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that 
purpose .  So, going forward, we ’re going to be very closely monitoring market developments 
and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we’ re going to be 
assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organi c growth of 
our balance sheet .  And I ’m sure we’ ll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting  period 
and certainly at our next meeting.  
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 26 
 STEVE LIESMAN .  Could  I just follow up here quickly?  D o you think you’ ve 
underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So we ’ve always said that it ’s—that the level is uncertain, right ?  
And that ’s something we ’ve tried to be very clear about .  And as you know, we ’ve invested lots 
of time talking to many of the large holde rs of reserves to assess their —what they say is their 
demand for reserves.  We try to assess what that is.  We ’ve tried to combine all of that together .  
We put it out so the public can react to it.  But , yes, there ’s real uncertainty, and it is certainly 
possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we 
thought .  That ’s always been a possibility, and it certainly is now .  Again, we ’ll be looking at this 
carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting. 
BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times .  Earlier this year —
or, actually , in September, the G overnors ’ Board put out a research paper looking—trying to 
quantify trade uncertainty.  A nd it suggested that it could drag through the busine ss investment 
channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year .  How much  
confidence do you have in the F ed’s ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty ?  And 
if you have confidence in that paper, it would see m to suggest a —sort of a more aggressively 
dovish path than the one that you ’ve chosen.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes.  So I thin k to provide a little context, F ed economists do 
research all the time .  It’s generally of  very high quality.  It ’s their research .  It’s not an official 
finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System .  It’s just —and, by the way, 
they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it —
their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession.  So it ’s a great tradition that we 
have .  And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is , it went after measuring trade 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 26 
 policy uncertainty through a couple of channels , including concerning tariffs, also concerning the 
threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output .  And 
while I would say, directly answering your question, there ’s real uncertainty around these —
around these effects.  It’ s a $22 trillion  economy.  T o try to isolate  the effects of certain things is  
very challenging, but we do the best we can.  So —and this piece of research found significant 
effects, and that ’s frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists 
have undertaken.  It ’s also cons istent with what we ’ve been hearing in the Beige B ook.  So, I 
mean , I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an 
effect .  You see it in weak business investment, weak exports —hard to quantify it precisely , 
though. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I was struck by the sort 
of anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that 
you now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the  fed funds rate is 
heading.  A nd I wondered, is it fair to say that the —those opinions have become sort of firmer in 
their conviction, and that it ’s going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now 
for that to move in either direction ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  And you’ re asking specifically about 2020?  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Well, the fact that this —the fed funds rate is now seen as not 
moving through 2020 suggests to me that these opinions are pretty—pretty  well anchored right 
now in those groups.  
CHAI R POWELL.  You know, honestly, I think it ’s hard to have hardened expectations 
about where rate policy is going to be a year from now .  I think the closer you get to the c urrent 
day, the more confidence  you can have .  But even then, knowing where the—knowi ng what the 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 26 
 data will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next 
90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there ’s a lot of uncertainty 
around that .   
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Fair enough, but if — 
CHAIR POWELL .  Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is , individual 
participants write down their forecast s.  It should give you a sense of how people are thinking 
about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for mone tary policy in that 
individual person’ s thinking, and I think that ’s a good thing to know .  I think I ’d be very 
reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction , really.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But just to follow  up, if I could.  T here were a number of  
arguments in July around the reason for cutting rates .  Have any of those gotten substantially 
weaker or changed around the table?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, well , I think , if you look at the U.S.—look at the U.S . 
economy, the U.S . economy has generally per formed roughly as expected —roughly:   The 
consumer is spending at a healthy clip,  I ’d say business fixed investment and exports have 
weakened further, and I ’d say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead .  The labor 
market is still strong , though, s o generally that is the same .  I think if you look at —the global 
economy, I think , has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy 
developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that inter meeting  
period.  So that ’s why I think what ’s—that ’s what ’s happened over the inter meeting  period, and, 
you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times .  I’m 
just curious on your balance sheet point .  You talked about the C ommittee thinking about 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 26 
 resuming organic growth, you know, over time .  I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your 
balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get 
through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back 
to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times , or would you need to see 
something a little b it above that ?  And is that a possibility the Committee would consider?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I think it ’s hard to deal with every hypothetical 
possibility.  I think , for the foreseeable future, we ’re going to be looking at, if needed, doing the 
sorts o f things that we did the last two days —these temporary open market operations .  That will 
be the tool that we use .  And the question will be , then—as we go through quarter -end, as we 
learn more, you know, what really —how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves?   
And I think we ’ll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida  with Politico .  Another money market question.  
You know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the 
volatility we ’ve seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well .  Are 
you all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help ?  
And, also , what is the status of the net  stable funding ratio rul e?  Are you all still planning on 
putting that out soon?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the 
level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we’ d probably raise the level of reserves 
rather than lower the LCR.  I mean , it’s not impossible that we would come to a view that the 
LCR is calibrated too high, but that ’s not something that we think right now .  On the other hand, 
it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to suppl y them .  In 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 26 
 terms of the net stable funding ratio, it ’s—I believe we  put it out for comment and got 
comments, and I believe we ’re looking at —at finalizing that in the relatively near future.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Just —just  to follow up, I mean, in terms of twea ks to the LCR, I 
mean , there ’s also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to 
maybe dip into their liquidity buffers. 
CHAIR POWELL .  I think we want banks to, you know —to use their liquidity buffers in 
times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as 
a general rule.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  So, about a month ago—Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business Network .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  About a month ago or so you said that there ’s no 
precedent to integrate trade uncertainty in to monetary policy.  In the last few weeks, have you 
figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty —and this level of trade uncertainty —into 
monetary policy going forward ?  You’ve  talked about uncertainty many times today. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So my point , really , was that —to start , that trade pol icy is not the 
business of the F ed, it ’s the business of Congress and the A dministration .  But —so why are we 
talking about it?  We ’re talking about it because anything tha t affects the achievement of our  
goals can , in principle , be something that monetary policy should take into consideration.  And 
our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that ’s weighing 
on the outlook.  So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can ’t address, really , is what 
businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade .  We can ’t do that .  We 
don’t have that tool .  But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness , to 
some extent , by supporting demand through sound monetary policy.  A nd we think our policy 
tools support economic activity through fairly well -understood channels :  by reducing interest 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 26 
 burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables , of homes , and other interest- sensitive 
items ; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending 
and also investment by businesses ; and also by boosting household and business confidence .  So, 
you know, I don’ t want to be heard to say that our tools don ’t have an effect .  They do.  B ut I 
was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can ’t address.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  So have you figured out how to navigatge it?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I think, yeah.  I mean , it’s a challe nge.  There ’s no simple 
bottom -line answer where I can say, yes, I ’ve got it for you here .  But what it amounts to is this :  
What you see is probably the kind of volatility that ’s typical of an important , complex, ongoing 
negotiation.  And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to 
the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate .  
We don’ t—we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements .  
We’re supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum 
employment and stable prices.  So we need to look through what ’s a pretty volatile situation .  So 
that means not overreacting quickly.  It means not underreacting, too.  So t hat’s really what 
we’re trying to do.  And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these 
crosswinds we’ ve felt .  And so, to some extent , I do believe that our shifting to a more 
accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook 
has remained favorable.  
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Fed funds —Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and 
Television .  Fed funds futures t rading since the statement was released shows that investors still 
think that another rate cut is coming this year .  On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide 
Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 26 
 keep them in place ?  Are you reacting to data now?  Are you reacting to your gut feeling about 
what trade tweets might mean?  Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what ’s 
going to ha ppen going forward?  What ’s the F ed’s reaction f unction now?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the 
events that are going on around the world, we ’ll be looking at, you know, the evolving 
geopolitical events , we’ll be looking at global growth, w e’ll be looking at trade policy 
uncertainty.  Most importantly, we ’ll be looking at the performance of the U.S . economy.  We’ll 
be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S . economy, particularly the outlook 
as it relates to maximum employment and stab le prices.  So all of those things in principle can 
affect the achievement of our goals .  It’s an unusual situation , because, you know, the U.S . 
economy itself —the largest part of it, the consumer part of it —is in strong shape .  The 
manufacturing part, les s so.  But , overall, you see an economy that —I think , generally , forecasts 
show  growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid 
year.  So the difference here is, we have significant , really , risks to that outlook from not just the 
geopolitical events , but also from slowing global growth and tra de policy uncertainty.  So we ’ll 
be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the 
outlook.  I can ’t—it’s a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those 
things .  We ’re not on a preset course .  We’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting 
as we see this, and , you know, we ’ll try to be as transparent as we can as we go.  
DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Donna Borak with CNN.  With 
the rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do  you 
worry about lessening the F ed’s firepo wer should there be a recession?  A nd is there any 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 26 
 scenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory?  A nd are there 
any other tools that you could use before having to go there?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I 
mentione d earlier, is , it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn 
gains momentum, and then—so there ’s a fair amount of research that would show that that ’s the 
case.  Now, I think that principle need s to be applied carefully to the situation at hand.  Wha t we 
believe we’ re facing here—what we th ink we ’re facing here is a situation which can be 
addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate.  As I 
mentioned, we are  watching carefully to see whether that is the case.  If , in fact , the economy 
weakens more, then we ’re prepared to be aggressive, and we ’ll do so if it turns out to be 
appropriate.  
You mentioned negative interest rates.  So negative interest rates is some thing that we 
looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.  We chose to —after we got to the 
effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large -scale 
asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional  monetary policy tools that we used 
extensively.  We feel that they worked fairly well.  We did not use negative rates .  And I think if 
we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound—again, not 
something we are expecting— then I think we would look at using large -scale asset purchases 
and forward guidance.  I do not think we ’d be looking at using negative rates.  I just don’ t think 
those will be at the top of our list.  
By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy re view where we ’re looking 
through all of these questions about the longer -run framework —the strategy , tools , and 
communications —and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year.  
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 26 
 DON LEE.  Don Lee  with the L.A. Times .  How much —can you talk about the 
mechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy ?  And how much —to what 
extent  will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, 
we th ink monetary policy works with, as Friedman said , long and variable lags.  So I think the 
real effects will be felt over time.  But, you know, we think that l ower interest rates will reduce  
interest burden for borrowers , so that interest -sensitive things like housing and durable goods and 
other things like that —cars —it supports purchases of those.  Just, again, broadly, more 
accommodative financial conditions —higher asset prices.  T hat’s—the models and the data show  
that that’s another powerful channel.  
I also think there ’s a confidence channel.  You see —you see household and business 
confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative.  So I think, through 
all of those channels , monetary policy works.  It isn ’t, you know, precisely the right tool for 
every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but , nonetheless, it broadly 
works, and, you know, we ’re going to use the tool  we have.  And if it comes to it, we ’ll use all of 
our tools .  So that ’s how we think it works and how we think it ’s working.  
DON LEE.  And how much will it offset the trade  impact, do you think ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  It ’s very hard to say.  It’s —you know, it’ s tough to say.  We ’ll—
we’ll us e our tools to offset negative —that’s really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it 
can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable 
prices.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  I ’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to , or could create a bubble of , 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 26 
 consumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for , especially , consumers to 
recover from the next recession or survive the next recession? 
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so, if you look at —if you actually look at households, 
households are in very strong shape.  They’ re less levered.  They ’ve got less debt.  They’ ve got 
more income relative to their interest requirements.  And they ’re in very good shape —much 
better shape than they were in before the financial crisis.  So the household sector as a sort of 
aggregate matter is in very good shape.  That doesn’ t mean that every single person in the 
household sector is in good shape, but , overall , it’s really not a concern.  
The business sector is something that, you know, we ’ve talked about a lot and studied a 
lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a 
high level.  However, so is the size of the business sector.  So, actually, the business sector itself 
is not materially higher leverage d tha n it was.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered 
companies, and that ’s the kind of thing that  happens during a long cycle when there aren ’t 
downturns for , now , into our 11th year.  You get —you know, you do get that kind of 
phenomenon in a long cycle.  
So that ’s something we ’re monitoring, and I think our view still is that that’ s a real issue, 
but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn.  It does  not 
have the makings of anything that w ould undermine the workings of the  financial system, for 
example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down.  It ’s more of —it’ s more of 
an amplifier.  We take it very seriously , though, and, you know, we ’re monitoring it carefully.  
We’re actually looking —the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now 
to identify where these loans are held all around the world.  So it’ s the subject of a lot of study 
and work, and, you know, we ’re trying to keep on top of it.

 GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  Greg Robb from Market Watch.  I ’m kind 
of hearing two things from you.  You’ re saying that the economy is doing well, but there ’s this 
sense with people that the economy is actually s tarting to slow now .  And people are —more and 
more , you talk—there ’s talk  about recession, so you—and even the F ed thinks the downside 
risks are rising.  So is the economy over  the next year —between now and the end of next year , 
do you think GDP growth is going to hold s teady , and the unemployment rate —could you talk 
about , just , how do you see the economy evolving over the next year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so, I think— and my colleagues and I , I think, all think 
that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and 
inflation moving back up to 2 percent.  And I think that ’s, by the way, widely shared among 
forecasters.  You know, the issue is more the risks to that.  You have downside risks here, and 
we’ve talked about them.  It ’s that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time — 
less so than for many other economies, but , still, there ’s a sector of our economy that ’s exposed 
to that.  Tra de policy uncertainty also has —apparently has an effect.  So —and you can see some 
weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that.  But , nonetheless —so the job of monetary 
policy is to adjust both to e nsure against  those downside risks , but also to support the economy in 
light of the existing weakness that we do see.  So we ’re not —as I mentioned , we’re not —we 
don’t see a recession.  We’ re not forecasting a recession.  But we are adjusting monetary policy 
in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is , in fact , a favorable outlook. 
GREG ROBB.  And the invert ed yield curve that we hear  is the b ond market signaling 
recession —what do you—is that—so that ’s not —that signal is not pe rtinent to you ?  Or where 
do you— 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 26 
 CHAIR POWELL.  No, we do —so we monitor the yield curve carefully,  along with a 
large , wide range of financial conditions.  We don’t —so, it’s not —there ’s no one thing that is 
dispositive among all financial conditions.  The yield curve is something that we follow 
carefully.  And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it ’s a positi ve 
outlook.  The thing—so , just to talk about the current situation, you see —you saw long- term 
rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two -thirds of that move in the space of a few days.  
So I think what really matters for all financial conditions gen erally is when there are changes—
material changes that are sustained for a period of time.  
So—but why are long -term rates low?  There are a number —there can be a signal about 
expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low  term premiums.  For 
example, just —well, it can just be that there ’s this large quantity of negative -yielding and very 
low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably , that ’s exerting downward 
pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really ne cessarily having an independent signal.  
Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would 
affect us.  So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is 
something we  pay careful —we’re not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but —and I 
think you can tell, on the C ommittee , there ’s a range of views —there are some who are very 
focused on the yield curve, others not so much.  You know, from my perspective, you watch it 
careful ly, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield 
curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it ’s sustained.  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi , Chairman Powell.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires.  
You mentioned trade poli cy being a complex, ongoing discussion.  What is your rule for 
stopping as far as interest rate cuts go?  You refer red to this as a “ midcycle adjustment. ”  The 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 26 
 median dot suggest s no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back- and-
forth  between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened.  So, 
you know, under what circumstances would you say, “Y ou know what, I think we ’ve cut 
enough, we stop now ”?  And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt  a need to take 
any steps to boost , like , employee morale at a time when the President  is constantly criticizing 
the F ed?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I ’d love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward 
stopping rule, but it ’s really just goin g to be when we think we ’ve done enough.  A nd, you know, 
our eyes are open.  We ’re watching the situation.  We ’ve cut rates twice.  We’ ve moved, really , 
through the course of this year, as I discussed, and , you know, we see ourselves as taking actions 
to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals.  And if you look at sort of the things that 
are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, 
because we really are reaching —this positive economy is reaching communities that haven’ t 
been reached in a long time.  There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, 
that’s all.  So I don’ t have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we ’re watching carefully, 
and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we ’ve done enough, but there may also 
come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively.  We 
don’t know.  We ’re going to be watching things caref ully.  The incoming data and the evolving 
situation and —that ’s what ’s going to guide our —guide us on that path.  
In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it ’s very high.  We ’re very unified.  
We feel like we’ re doing the best job we can in ser ving the American people.  
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chairman.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.   It’s been 
reported that the CFPB is investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts.  
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 26 
 I’m wondering if the Fed is also investigating this a nd, given the pending order against Wells 
Fargo , if you’ re concerned that these banks are too big to man age. 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I saw the headline , like, this morning during all of the 
preparation and everything and this morning’ s meeting.  I really don ’t have anything for you on 
that.  I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk 
management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite 
harmful to the consumers and to the image o f the institution.  I have no idea whether that ’s what 
happened at Bank of America .  I really don ’t know , standing here today.  
STEVEN BECKNER.  Steve  Beckner filing for NPR,  freelance.  The Fed and your 
fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what ’s possible for monetary 
policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results.  
Meanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade , policy are pursuing their own separate 
courses.  As you and your col leagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever 
consider the limitations of monetary policy?  Should you be more explicit about what monetary 
policy can and cannot do in this environment?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we try to be clear about that , but, really, I think our job is 
to use our tools as best we can to achieve—you know , to do the jobs that Congress has assigned 
us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices.  That ’s our real job.  
In terms of  giving the fiscal authorities —who , by the w ay, are the ones who created us—
advice about how to do their job, you know, we kee p that at a high level, I think.  A nd, at a high 
level, yes, I would say, and I ’ve said before, that it ’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful 
and that has muc h more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the 
longer -run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 26 
 participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers.  All of that comes from the private sect or, 
but also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy.  
Over the long run, we can’ t really affect the growth rate of the United States .  The 
potential growth rate of the United States  is not a function of monetary policy.  It ’s a function of 
other things.  So I —I try to be clear about that , and so —but , ultimately, fiscal —fiscal authorities 
will do what they seem —deem appropriate.  
SAMIRA HUSSAIN.  Samira Hussain, BBC News.  Mr. Trump has been a very vocal 
critic of you and your col leagues, recently calling you “ boneheads ” and just now has called you a 
“terrible communicator. ”  How do you respond to these criticisms ?  And any regrets to have this 
many press conferences? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I don ’t.  I’m not going to change my practice her e today of not 
responding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials.  I will just say that I 
continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has 
served the public well over time.  A nd I assu re you that my colleagues and I will continue to 
conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations.  We ’re going to use our best 
judgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that ’s what I 
have to say  on it.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  Thanks 
for taking my question.  As we saw with falling yields , at least up until the beginning of this 
month, there ’s been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was  partly maybe to 
blame for the liquidity crunch in  repo markets that we saw this week.  I mean, does the F ed have 
concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt ?  Is that a conversation that you also 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 26 
 have with Treasury S ecretary Mnuchin —about wha t the proper way to maybe address some of 
the challenges down the road with that type of , kind of , heavy interest globally?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Not really, no.  That’s really —that ’s really Treasury ’s job and 
Congress ’s job, in terms of, well, there ’s how much to spend, and how big the deficits are , and 
then there ’s how to finance it.  And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from t he Fed.  
We take—we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work.  Now, that doesn’ t stop 
us, from time to tim e, from saying that we think it ’s important that the U.S. fiscal picture return 
to a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it ’s not.  That ’s been the case for a long time, 
and that ’s something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is 
strong.  So we limit ourselves to high- level statements like that.  
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post .  Mr. Chairman, in your 
view, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe  and 
Japan and other parts of the world?  Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or 
any risk to the global economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so I guess I would say it this way.  Global capital markets are 
highly integ rated, and, you know, our rates—our long rates are definitely being pulled down by 
the very, very low rates that are abroad.  And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this :  
that low rates abroad are a symbol —or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, e xpectations of low 
inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas 
about how to break out of that low equilibrium.  Now, that has implications for us.  You know, 
we—in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the 
U.S. economy.  So that ’s going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten 
because of that.  And so I think we put all —all of that goes into our thinking and into our 
September 18, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 26 
 models.  We do understand how the —you know, how the international sector interfaces with the 
U.S. economy.  We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy.  Thank you very 
much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
October 30, 2019 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , and welcome.  My colleagues at the Federal 
Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people.  We do this by steadfastly pursuing 
the goals that Congress has given us :  maximum employment and stable prices.  We ’re 
committed to making the best decisions we can based o n facts and objective analysis.  
Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year.  We took this 
step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide 
some insurance against ongoing risks.  As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have 
made since last year are providing —and will continue to provide —meaningful support to the 
economy.  We believe that mone tary policy is in a good place. 
The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains 
favorable.  The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate.  Household spending continues to 
be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence.  In 
contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined 
over the past year.  Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those 
sectors.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, 
reflecting solid household spending and s upportive financial conditions.  
The job market remains strong.  The unemployment rate has been near h alf-century lows 
for a year and a half.  The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid ; we had 
expected some slowing after last year’s strong pace.  Participation in the labor force by people in 
their prime working years has been increas ing, a nd wages have been rising, particularly for 
lower -paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income communities tell us 
that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 24 
 chapters to their liv es.  This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that 
the strong job market rea ches more of those left behind.  
Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months 
through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent.  Inflation 
pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer -term inflation expectations are at the lower end 
of their historic ranges.  We’re mindful  that continued below -target inflation could lead to an 
unwelcome downward slide in long- term inflation expectations.  However, against the backdrop 
of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.  
Overall, we  continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor 
market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.  While this has been 
our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that wil l best achieve 
these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.  As I mentioned, weakness in 
global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks.  
These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures , have led us to lower our assessment 
of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year.  In both July and September, 
we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so 
again today, bringi ng the range to 1½  to 1¾ percent.  
The policy adjustments  we’ve made to date will continue to provide significant support 
for the economy.  Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments 
on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time.   We see the current 
stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about 
the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong 
labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  We believe monetary policy 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 24 
 is in a good place to achieve these outcomes.  Looking ahead, we ’ll be monitoring the effects of 
our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the out look, as we assess the 
appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate.  Of course, if developments emerge 
that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Po licy is not 
on a preset course.  
Let me end with a few  words about our technical monetary policy operations.  In January, 
we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample -reserves 
regime.  In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our 
admi nistered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves.  
In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the 
gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July.  
In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid- September, 
we concluded that it would be  appropriate to maintain , over a time —over time , a level of reserve 
balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year.  To achieve this 
ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the 
second quarter of next year as well as conti nue temporary open market  opera tions at least 
through January.  
These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of 
monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves.  They do not 
represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.  In particular, our Treasury bill purchases 
should not be confused with the large -scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the 
financial crisis.  In those programs, we purchased longer -term securities to  put downward 
pressure on longer -term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions.  In contrast, 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 24 
 increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short -term 
assets held by the public and should not materially a ffect demand and supply for longer -term 
securities or financial conditions more broadly.  
Thank you.  I will be happy to take your questions. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McK ee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  So I guess 
the question is , is this it?  Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve 
your goal of sustaining the expansion?  And as  far as global Wall Street’ s primary question, what 
kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess —some sort of sig nificant 
deterioration in what?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So what we ’ve said, to repeat , is that we see the current stance of 
policy as “ likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy 
remains broadly consistent with our outlook.”   And we say that, really, becau se both of the 
performance of the economy and the stance of policy.  The performance of the economy has 
been —particularly the household sector —has been strong, has been resilient , with low 
unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, l abor force participation 
moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending.  The 
manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing , and also investment and exports have been 
weaker.  But, overall, we ’ve seen moderate gro wth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up.  
We see the outlook a s for more of the same.  We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps 
having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting  period, although, some 
remain —some things remain to be seen.  So that ’s the economy.  
Turning to policy, we ’ve moved the stance of policy over  the course of the year to a more 
accommodative stance, and , after the cuts a t the last three meetings, the federal funds r ate is now 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 24 
 in a range between 1 ½ and 1¾ percent .  We feel that policy is well positioned to support the 
outlook that I described.  So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I 
mentioned, we ’re going to be watching all factors ,  And if developments emerge that c ause a  
material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  But that ’s what it would 
take:  a materi al reassessment of our outlook.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up—i f the markets decide that you need to cut 
rates again , will you be for ced to follow?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about 
the risks to the outlook, and I ’ve given you a sense of what our outlook is.  It’ s for moderate 
growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 perce nt objective.  If something happens 
to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that ’s what would cause us to change our views 
on the appropriate stance of policy.  
HEATHER LONG.  Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post .  You just said that the 
risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction.  I’m wondering if you could specify—is 
that on trade , or are there other matters?   This morning we obviously learned that we ’ve now had 
two quarters of contracting business investment , which would seem to be moving the outlook in 
the other direction.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , in terms of risks, what I was referring to there —the principal 
risks that we ’ve been monitoring have been, really , slowing global growth  and trade policy 
developments  as well as muted inflat ion pressure.  So  I was really referring there to trade 
developments.  We have that phase -one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put 
into effect , could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and re ducing uncertainty, and that 
would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time.  So  that has 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 24 
 the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture.   Brexit , I would say, as well —it 
appears that the risk of a no -deal Brexit seems to have materially declined.  I think on both 
situations there ’s plenty of risk left, but I’ d have to say that t he risks seem to have subsided.  
You asked  about business investment, and that ’s right.  Business investment has been 
weak , and t oday ’s reading was weak as well .  And it was broad acro ss equipment and other parts 
of—all parts of business fixed investment were weak.  That ’s consistent with what we ’ve seen, 
but that ’s the economy we ’ve had this year.  What we ’ve had is an economy where the consumer 
is really driving growth , and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 
3 percent  in this quarter —in this first reading for the quarter.  So, overall, we see the economy as 
having been resilient to the —you know, the winds that have been blowing this year.  
HEATHER LONG.  Can I just follow up quickly?  I mean , there ’s this concern that I 
sometimes hear that , with business , businesses have cut investment , and are they going to turn 
around and cut employment?  You know, sort of , if they continue to be concerned.  Can  you give 
a sense of how the C ommittee is thinking—thi nking through that possibility?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, so that is a risk.  That ’s a risk that we’ ve been monitoring, but 
we don’ t see it yet.  We don’ t see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that.  But the 
risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing— in export investment , business 
investment , parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don ’t 
see that.  
What we continue to see is good job creation.  U nemployment has declined again, and 
the household survey is now at a 50- year low —has been, you know, very close to 50- year low s 
for 18 months now.  So it ’s very positive.  The consumer -facing companies that we talk to in our 
vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 24 
 you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that ’s their principle focus.  So that is the 
thing that ’s pushing the economy forward, and it doesn’ t seem to have been affected so far by 
weakness in the other areas.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  Thanks for taking our 
questions.  So you’ ve previously sort of  compared this rate -cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in 
the ’90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan F ed took those cuts back after a while.  
They raised rates again fairly quickly.  And I guess I ’m just curious what the onus is for doing 
that in this cycle.  Wh at would make you guys decide it ’s appropriate to raise interest rates 
again? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So the reason why we raised interest rates is because —generally is 
because we see inflation as moving up —or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really 
don’t see that now.  Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year.  We thought that that 
was due , to some extent , to idiosyncratic or transient  factors.   That turns out to have been the 
case, so it ’s moved back up.  But it seems to be settling in below 2  percent .  So we really don’ t 
see that risk . 
And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways —both surveys 
and market based over the course of this —of, really , the recent mont hs.  And, you know, we 
think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we ’re strongly 
committed to achieving our 2 percent  inflation objective on a symmetric basis.   We think it ’s 
essential that we do that.  
So we ’re not thinking about raising rates right now.  There obviously will be times in the 
future where that will be appropriate.  What we ’re really thinking now is that our current stance 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 24 
 of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in  keeping with our 
expectations. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. —Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I ’m—not to make 
light of it, but I ’m a little bit— I wonder if you could help me out with the appropr iate 
understanding of the word “appropriate”  here.  S o the statement says  that the Committee  is going 
“to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the 
appropriate path of the target range. ”  That tells me you could go either way.  You  came in , and 
you used the word “ appropr iate,” that the current rate is “likely to remain appropriate ,” which 
means you’ re on hold.  So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from 
this believing what “ appropriate ” means?  Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you 
should rem ain on hold, or is it , really , you could go either way here?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain 
appropriate —likely to remain appropriate —as long as incoming information about the economy 
is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, 
strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent .  That’s—so that ’s what we’ re 
saying about that.  We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a  material 
reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly.  So that ’s really how we ’re 
thinking about it.  I can ’t point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds.  It 
really —it would be a reassessment of —a material reassessment  of our overall outlook, which is 
what I described.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  I ’m sorry, just  to—why isn’ t the phrase “likely to remain  
appropriate”  in the statem ent if that’ s the sense of the C ommittee?  
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 24 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, there’s —there ’s a lot of, you know, pract ice and science and 
history , in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we 
say in the  press conference statement.  It’ s a—you know, it ’s a judgment call.  You know, I ’m 
saying it now, so — 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thanks. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal .  You 
described the recent sl ide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as “unwelcome. ”  You said that 
inflation expectations are “very important .”  What, if anything, would the C ommittee be 
prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are —
they’ re quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflati on.  We need 
them to be anchored in a level —at a level that ’s consistent with our symmetric 2  percent  
inflation goal.   And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome.  
That’s what we ’re doing now. 
We’re also, as part of our  review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way 
we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us —that would be more 
supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent —on a symmetric 2  percent  basis over time.  
That’s at the ve ry heart of what we ’re doing in the review.  It ’s too early to be announcing 
decisions.  We haven ’t made them yet .  But we ’re in the middle of thinking about ways that we 
can make that symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 
2 percent  inflation.  And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent  inflation, 
and that is the —that is the  thing that must happen for credibility in this area.  So we ’re

 NICK TIMIRAOS.  How soon do you think that review mi ght be announced to the 
public?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re in the middle —we ’re really quite in the middle of it now, 
and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year.  These are—you know, these 
changes to monetary policy frameworks happen —they don’ t happen really quickly, let ’s say.  
Inflation targeting took many years to evolve.  I don’ t think we ’ll take many years here.  I think 
we’ll wrap it up around the middle of ne xt year , would be my guess.  I  have some confidence 
in that.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence of Fox Business.  Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, for taking this.  So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if 
you get some of that uncertainty cleared up —specifically , the phase -one China trade deal 
finished and  USMCA ratified?  How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it 
stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year —or, rate hikes next year ?  I’m sorry.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Rate hikes for next year . 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes , because I ’ve heard the argument that t rade’s causing the 
uncertainty.  U ncertainty is keeping the prices low.  I ’ve heard that argument from a F ed 
president from one of the D istricts.  So you remove that uncerta inty, prices, then, would naturally 
rise.  So could there be a point, or how —I guess my question is , how big of an impact on 
monetary policy would removing that uncertainty  be? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I would just say that a—if we were  to have a sustained 
reduction in trade tensions —broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these 
uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment , which is —trade uncertainty ’s been 
weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many a nalysts.  And, 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 24 
 ultimately, it could affect activity.   I wouldn’ t expect that the effects on activity or confidence 
would be immediate , or—wo uld there  be immediate effects i n economic activity.  I think it 
would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time.  
You come back to the question of raising rates .  So that ’s really about inflation .  And you 
know, we haven’ t yet—we just touched 2 percent  core i nflation , to pick one measure —just 
touched it for a few months, and then we ’ve fallen back.  So I think we would need to see a 
really significant move up in inflation that ’s persistent before we would consider raising rates to 
address inflation concerns. 
BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times .  The other thing you ’ve 
talked about in this review is the gains that a super high- pressure labor market have, particularly 
for the communities that you’ re talking about.  You mentioned it just now whe n you were 
talking.   If that ’s something that you’ re identifying , and that ’s something that the Fe d is learning 
more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are 
reentering the labor force?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think we ’re doing that.  I mean, I think we ’re keeping—I 
think we ’ve made very substantial adjustments to polic y over the course of this year , if you think 
about it.  We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, w e went  to “patient ,” now 
we’ve done three rate cuts.  It’s a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time.  
So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you’ re talking about, 
which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation. 
BRENDAN GREELEY.  So if you were to d escribe the shifts that you ’ve made so far, it 
wasn ’t just about trade uncertainty.  It was about , specifically , these kinds of high- pressure labor 
gains that you’ ve talked about.  
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 24 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, no.  It was —so we ’ve said it was about three things.  It ’s been 
about the slowing global economy.  You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity 
around the globe.  It ’s been building for just about 18 months now, and that ’s having an effect on 
U.S. activity.  That ’s part of the weakness in manufacturing, export , and business investment.  
We’ve had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and 
investment and sentiment.  And we ’ve had inflation, which—we ’ve called  out the risk of 
inflation running persistently below 2 percent  as a risk that we needed to address.  So we ’ve been 
doing it to address all of those things. 
I would say,  the gains in the labor market have been great to see.  It ’s particularly the fact 
that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage 
gains in the last couple of years.  That ’s a great thing.  You know from our Fed Listens  events 
that we ’ve been hearing from people who live and work in low - and moderate -income 
communities that this is the best labor market they ’ve seen in their lifetime , things like that . 
And, by the way, that there ’s also —there ’s still so many people who are, you know, still 
not in the labor market yet,  and that —there ’s just a lot more good that can be done there.  At the 
same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and—but , yes, those gains are very 
positive.  We do call them out.  They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and 
that’s something we ’re committed to doing. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  On the Fed’s balance sheet —you all  recently resumed purchases of 
Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue ?  And, given 
the fact that, you know, the repo operations —it seems like the F ed is having to increase the 
amount of liquidity— temporary liquidity that it ’s injecting into the system.  You know, do you 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 24 
 still feel like it’ s just —that there is not enough reserves in the system ?  Do you feel like you have 
a good sense of what ’s going on there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, on the “ how long,”  what we ’ve said is that we expect bill 
purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year.  And we ’ve said that 
temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of 
January, I believe.  Yes , through January.  
In terms of the causes, so there ’s a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market 
participants and all kinds of analysts.  And, you know, one thing is that we t hink we need 
reserves to be back up to the level —the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the 
various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, 
and that ’s the level in early September.  So we ’re going to be adding reserves to get back to that 
place.  That ’s one thing.  
There are also —it may be —one thing that was surprising about the episode was that 
liquidity didn ’t seem to flow as one might have expected.  We had surveyed the banks carefully 
about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above 
that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.  
They just —they didn’ t do tha t, and so the question is why.  A nd are there things that we can do 
that would —adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in 
the system without in any way sacrificing safety and so undness or financial stability?  So we ’re 
looking at those.  Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the 
short term, but those are a range of things that we ’re looking at as well.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions.  
I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of , what the strongest or most 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 24 
 important case is for feeling that you’ ve now taken out  adequate insurance.  Is it the response 
you’re seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far?   Is it 
the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit?   Or is it 
something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted  
itself, et c etera?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Honestly, it ’s really the—there isn ’t any one factor.   It’s really the 
whole range of economic data and also what we see as—about our stance of policy, which we 
believe is the appropriate stance.  It ’s really both of those things.  Again, if you look at the 
performance of the economy thr ough this, the consumer sector has  been quite resilient.  Witness 
today’ s GDP report.  And it ’s just —again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that 
sector continues to be strong.  We know that the manufa cturing, investment , trade , export  sector 
has been weak.  That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we ’ve got an economy that is showing 
moderate growth, and we think that today’ s setting —we’re now  at 1.5 to 1.75 percent .  That is, 
we believe, an accommodative level and a level that wi ll support that outlook that we  have. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But are you concerned—just to follow up , really .  This is kind 
of a one -legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other  things —exports, 
investment —tha t it’s going t o weaken further at some point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we don’ t see any evidence of that.  What we see is— what 
we see is that the consumer sector continues strong.  Agai n, low initial claims.  It’ s all—the data  
we monit or, obviously, is a very broad range of data.  We also see now, I think, more clearly the 
effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity.  You ’re 
seeing strong durable goods sales.  You ’re seeing housing now contributing to growth for the 
first time in a while —two-tenths, I think , this quarter.  And you’ re seeing retail sales— the retail 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 24 
 sales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today’ s release was 2.9  percent .  So that ’s 
good.  A nd I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and 
home  buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers ’ incomes rising, and keeping 
consumer confidence at high levels , where it currently is.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  You were just talking about how t he 
lower rates have affected consumer behavior .  Is there a concern that there ’s just less potency on 
the business investment side that you’ re, in effect, pushing on a string?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I think monetary policy works  through the channels that we 
understand.  I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest- rate-sensitive sectors, 
which are the ones—some of the ones that I mentioned.  I think it ’s—I think interest rates are a 
factor in business investment, but I don’ t believe they ’re the main factor and main driver .  And I 
think, you know, what one would like to see for —to support greater manufacturing activity, 
business investment, and exports would be a global recovery .  And, you know, there ’s a lot of 
monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal  accommodation , maybe , in the global economy 
now.  Not here, but perhaps elsewhere.  And that should turn —that should support growth in the 
global economy.  A nd, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time 
as well. 
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You mentioned 
Fed Listens a couple  of times, and what you’ ve heard from people there about how it ’s 
benefited  the disadvantaged or lower -income workers —the h ot job market we have.  Has the F ed 
thought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens  and maybe taking in some of this 
input from people that you don’ t alw ays hear from —things like the Beige B ook focus on 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 24 
 businesses ?  Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from com munity groups more 
regularly?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  We think—we think that Fed Listens  has been a great success for us, 
and I ’m sure we will repeat it .  In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review 
will become institutionalized and be done every few years.  I would say this :  In the Beige B ook, 
we talk to educational institutions, health -care institutions, community groups, labor groups —it’s 
not just businesses.  And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of 
our regional banks . 
We al so meet quite regularly at the B oard with representatives of low - and moderate -
income communities .  And so we’re —we ’re very conscious of —you know, that we represent all 
Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspect ives.  That ’s why we —you know, we talk 
about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about 
groups that haven’ t experienced that yet .  And so we’re —we try to remind ourselves that we 
serve everybody . 
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg .  You mentioned housing and 
today’ s GDP data .  When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing 
or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we’ re moving to trend growth for the rest of the 
year and next year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that is —our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 
2 percent , which is pretty close to trend .  That ’s our outlook :  could be better , could be worse .  
You know, it ’s—you never say you’ ve achieved it .  But that’ s our outlook.  A nd we feel like our 
current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook.

 DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Chair Powell, setting aside market 
expectations for today’ s rate cut —obviously, 97 percent  sort of expected that this would happen 
today—can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular 
meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December , and if there was any 
discussion about that around the tab le?  Thanks . 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I think this seems to be the right movement .  You can see that 
we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views .  But, in the end, we had a strong vote in 
favor of this action.  I strongly believe it ’s the right acti on.  I strongly believe that the actions 
we’ve taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and 
are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future .  So— 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  C hairman Powell, it seems 
that the differences all across the country —that different regions are reacting differently to the 
China trade, and some regions are much weaker than others.  There ’s this urban versus rural 
divide , the coasts versus the middle of the country .  How does that factor into your policy 
decisions ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it ’s—monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument .  So 
we can ’t—obviously, we can’ t raise interest rates some place and lower them other places.  But 
we’re very conscious .  The first thing to know is to understand that , that—and we ’ve called that 
out, as you, I’m sure , know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Report s to Congress .  The sort 
of rural –urban disparities in —you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in 
health outcomes.  You know, i t’s a big and growing difference —set of differences.  We don’ t 
really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our 
economy that we may not be —that we might have —may not have the right tools to best address 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 24 
 them, but we call them out because, you know, we ’re spending all of our time with the economy, 
and those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by—at the 
national level and at  the state level . 
GREG ROBB.  Oh, could I follow?  Sorry, could I follow ?  Could—s orry.  Just , so—so 
are you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them  to do something down the 
road?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m not asking Congress to do anything right now .  I sometimes have 
noted that it would be appropriate .  Let me p ut it this way :  We do what we do, which is , we’re 
assigned a job , which is maximum employment and stable prices.  We do financial stability .  We 
do bank regulation.  The U.S. economy faces significant longer -term challenges around potential 
growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all 
kinds of things .  And those are issues for Congress, and they’ re not issues for us.  But if you 
really w ant the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United 
States, you need—you need proper monetary policy.  But, really, it isn ’t monetary policy .  
Really , it’s fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth. 
DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times .  I think you said, Chair Powell, that the 
primary positive development in risk s to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects 
for a phase -one agreement with China .  But, given the ups and downs of the trade  dispute and 
that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about 
developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that ’s dependent a  good part on the wins of the 
trade negotiations ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, I know, t hat’s—I wouldn’ t—that ’s not how I would 
characterize it .  I would just —I noted that it may be that there ’s been progress there toward —
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 24 
 away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there ’s the makings of 
a possible settlement there.  I didn’ t say we ’re baking that in or anything, but I ’m just noting that 
that’s the case.  As with Brexit— it’s still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election 
and what the ultimate result will be .  But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no- deal 
Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations 
with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution .  That ’s all I’ m saying.  
DON LEE.  If I could follow up, if the phase -one agreem ent, then , doesn’ t work out, then 
would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that— 
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s one factor among many, many factors that factor into our 
assessment of the outlook .  And if we see—if we have —if we —if things happen that cause us to 
materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, t hen we 
would act accordingly.  
VIRGINIE MONTET.  Virginie Montet with the Agence France- Presse.  T hank you.  
The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and 
how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth.  In light of the recent outcome of the strike at 
General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle 
incomes and promoting more shared growth in  the long run ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be .  
I will just say , on the General Motors strike, it’s —it’ s likely to have taken away a couple of 
tenths of growth this quarter.  That ’s likely to come back , maybe , over the first half of next year .  
And I think it ’s good to see it settled .  But I ’m not going to comment on what the appropriate 
labor arrangements are.  That ’s a little bit far afield fro m our task here.  Thank you.

 PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman.  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones News wires.  
[Inaudible ] Oh, I w as wondering what that was .  Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newsw ires.  
Thank you—t hank you, Chairman.  Wondering if you would categorize the current s tance of  
monetary policy as accommodative, or if it ’s just, you know, that neutral was lower than we 
thought at this time last year.  Secondly, you know, we ’re now two years removed from the T ax 
Cuts and J obs A ct, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before —2 percent.  
So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long- term growth, you 
know, is it fair to say that the T ax Cuts and J obs A ct worked the way it was supposed to?   
Thanks . 
CHAIR POWELL.  So rry, say again what your first question was ?  I wrote it down , I 
can’t—  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Sorry —if policy is  accommodative  right now . 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, y es.  Okay .  So if you look at where the federal funds rate is 
trading , it should be in the middle of , or maybe the lower half of , the range of 150 to 175.  So 
that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.  I think my own sense would be that 
that’s somewhat accommodative policy .  I would say, though, that there ’s a range of plausible 
estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such 
estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process 
continues .  But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of 
policy, and an appropriate stance , given the situation we ’re in with continuing downside risks 
and—that I mentioned.  So— 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi .  Jean Yung from Market News.  I wanted to ask about financial 
stability risk s.  Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 24 
 concerns over the high level of risky  corporate debt .  So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around 
the world, are you more worried about financial stability risk s and reach -for-yield?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time .  
It’s what we do since the financial crisis, as I ’ve mentioned before .  Currently, we don ’t see large 
imbalances.  This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the 
ones we ’ve seen certainly before the crisis happened . 
So we have a four -part framework, I ’ll quickly mention .  The first is leverage in the 
financial system , which  is low by historical standards .  The second is fundi ng risk, which is the 
risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the 
nonbanking financial sector .  If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not 
broadly across a range .  We don’ t see bubbles and  that kind of thing.  And that leaves the fourth, 
which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector , and that ’s households and businesses .  So with 
households, again, we don’ t see leverage.  We see them actually getting in very good shape 
financially in  the aggregate.  Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, 
but in the aggregate, the household sector  is in a very good place .  That leaves businesses, which 
is where the issue has been .  Leverage among corporations and other form s of business, private 
businesses, is historically high.  We ’ve been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps . 
So that’s what I would say, but it ’s—corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our 
framework, and it is something that we ’re pay ing quite a bit of attention to .  And it’s been part of 
the last couple of S hared National C redit exams, and we’ ve been monitoring it carefully and 
taking appropriate action .

 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Have 
the pr oblems in the repo market led  you to  look into whether the liquidity and capital 
requirements for banks are too hi gh?  Is that something that the F ed mig ht review?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re—I think, again , I think the most important basic thing is to 
get the  level of reserves back up so that —reserves move up and down with some volatility.  We 
don’t want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September , which is, 
again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion .  That ’s the main thing, that ’s the first thing .  And we ’re 
on a path to do that , between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases . 
In addition to that —in addition to that, we ’re looking at —there are—it ’s a big, 
complicated marketplace, and there was the—one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that 
banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here.  They were well 
above that, and yet they didn’ t deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities 
to do that .  That didn’ t happen.  So why is that?  And so, we ’re doing careful analysis of that . 
You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this ?  I don ’t 
think so.  I don ’t think that’ s where this goes.  I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for  
example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing.  It used to be a common thing for 
banks to ha ve intraday liquidity from the F ed, what are called “daylight overdrafts .”  That ’s 
something we can look at .  Also, there are just a few technical t hings that we can look at that 
would perhaps make the liquidity that we have —which we think is ample in the financial 
system —move more freely and be more liquid, if you will .  And those are things we would do, 
but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability . 
NAOATSU AOYAMA.  Thank you very much, Chairman Powell .  Naoatsu Aoyama 
from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper .  Given this sustained level of low  inflation, even 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 24 
 in—even in this country, do you think—so the re seems to be a higher possibility that lower 
inflation expectation s will remain going forward.  So do you think a Japan -like situation , or 
“Japanification ” of chronically low inflation and interest rates —the U.S. is getting trapped by the  
Japanification of this situation ?  Do you think so?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we —we , of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now 
the situation in Europe, and we —we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures 
around the world.  And we don’ t think we ’re exempt from those .  But, of course, if you look at 
our current inflation performance, it hasn’ t been anything like what we ’ve seen in those other 
places.  But we don’ t think —again, we don’ t think we ’re exempt from those pressures, and we 
are, therefore, st rongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is 
consistent with the symmetric 2  percent  inflation objective .  That’s what we ’re committed to, and 
we’ll use our tools to achieve .  So we take —we take the risk very seriously. 
It’s not —the risk isn ’t that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent.  The risk 
is that what we ’ve seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that  it’s been very 
hard for them to get off .  Once inflation expectations start slidin g down, inflation moves down.  
You have less —interest rates move down as well , because there’ s an inflation component in 
interest rates .  And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to 
hold and really move inflation expectat ions up so that they’ re squarely and firmly anchored at a 
level that ’s consistent with 2  percent  inflation . 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance .  Another type of balance 
sheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch —there was a discussion before 
that, that maybe we should move —or, rather, the F ed should move to a more neutral balance 
sheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage -backed securities that are on the balance 
October 30, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 24 
 sheet and maybe replace them with shorter -term T reasuries.  Not any—I haven’ t really heard an 
update on the composure or  the composition of the balance sheet for right now.  I ’m just 
wondering if the F ed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect 
to hear something on that . 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it’s a —it’s an issue, but it ’s not an issue that we’ re 
currently working on and —or reaching a decision on or anything like that .  The question of the  
longer -run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a —is a  big one, a nd it’s one we ’ll return 
to over time , but not —not  imminently . 
VIVIENNE NUNIS.  Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we ’re 
seeing the greatest economy in American h istory.  I just wondered , as the C hair of America ’s 
central bank , what you made of that characterization . 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I ’m going to maintain my longtime  practice of not —not 
commenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you. 
VIVIENNE NUNIS.  Okay, thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
December 11 , 2019 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone.  To begin, I ’d like to say a few words 
about Paul Volcker, who, as you know , passed away earlier this week.  Paul Volcker served as 
Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987.  He accomplished many things during his long and 
distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere.  Of course, he’ s best known for leading the fight 
to tame the d ouble -digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the 
prosperity and price stability we enjoy today.  But what is perhaps most admirable about him —
more than his many accomplishments —was his character.  He believed that there is no higher 
calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion’ s share of his life to it.  With courage, 
integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit 
all Americans.  My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example. 
Turning to today’ s meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate 
unchanged after lowering it a total of ¾ percentage point at the previous  three meetings.  As 
always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given 
us:  maximum employment and price stability.  Our economic outlook remains a favorable one 
despite global developments and ongoing risks.  With our decisions through the course of the 
past year, we believe th at monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by 
supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 
2 percent goal.  
The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record.  Household spending 
has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer 
confidence.  In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing 
output has declined over the past year.  As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth

 abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors.  Even so, the overall 
economy has been growing moderately.  And with a strong household sector and supportive 
monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue.  As seen from 
FOMC participants’  most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows 
slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent.  
The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for well more tha n a year, and 
the pace of job gains remains solid.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime 
working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing.  And wages have been rising, 
particularly for lower- paying jobs.  People who live and work in low - and middle -income 
communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new 
opportunities.  Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and 
all levels of education.  These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the 
expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  We expect the job 
market to remain strong.  The median of participants ’ projections for the unemployment rate 
remains below 4 percent ov er the next several years.  
Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months 
through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent , and core inflation —which excludes 
volatile food and energy prices and is a better indic ator of future inflation —was 1.6 percent.  
While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our 
objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer -term inflation expectations drift 
down, pulling actua l inflation even lower.  In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and 
closer to their effective lower bound.  As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support 
the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

 for American families and businesses.  Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive 
monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent.  The median of participants ’ 
projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent i n 2021.  We ’re strongly committed to 
achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. 
Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best 
achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced 
some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments.  As the year 
progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these 
developments and to provide some insurance against the associat ed risks.  In addition, inflation 
pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of 
policy.  Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year , as 
seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by ¾ percentage point.  This shift has helped 
support the economy and has kept the outlook on track.  The medians of participants ’ projections 
for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, 
aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019.  Of course, that is the function of monetary 
policy— to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces 
acting on the economy.  
We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a 
strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  As long as incoming 
informat ion about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance 
of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate.  Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the 
effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we 
assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, if 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 26 
 developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond 
accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course.  
Finally,  I wanted to note that we ’ve been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting 
repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December.1  These technical 
operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money marke t 
pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy.  Our operations 
have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued.  To 
address possible pressures in money markets over the year -end, we ’ve been conducting term 
repo operations spanning year -end.  We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as 
appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Thank you, and I ’ll be happy to 
take your questions.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  [Inau dible  remark ]  Sorry —Howard Schneider with Reuters .  
Sorry about that.  So I was struck by the , sort of , disconnect that exists here between the behavior 
of unemployment and inflation.  Y ou seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three  
years run ning—more —underneath the longer -run level, yet inflation never really accelerates.  S o 
what are we to make of that? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , that ’s—what ’s happening there is the fact that the relationship 
between resource utilization , or unemployment , and infl ation has just gotten weaker and weaker 
over the years.  If you go back 50 years , you would have seen that, when there was —when labor 
markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up.  And then as the Fed 
got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where 
there ’s still a connection, but it’s —it’ s a very faint one.  And I —what that suggests is that you 
                                                 
1 Chair Powell intended to say the repurchase operations were announced in October.  
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 26 
 would need to keep policy somewhat accommodative .  And we believe that policy is somewhat 
accommodative , and we think that that ’s the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive 
up inflation.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could f ollow up on that —I mean , it’s faint to nonexistent , 
though, it seems to me, so this  suggest s that, really , your policy leve r as it exists now isn ’t really 
influencing prices at all.  So , in that case, what do you do to reach your target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don’ t think that’ s right .  I mean, we —the —again , the 
relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak , has been weak.  The coefficient 
is something like 0.1.  So it ’s much, much lower than it used to be , but I don’ t know that it ’s 
gone down any more in the last decade .  It just is quite faint.  But it’ s still there .  I mean , you can 
see it .  If you look—look at where wages were three  or four  years ago, they were running around 
2 percent.  And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up 
to 3 and 3½ percent , and that suggests tightening.  The same thing is true , but much less true , of 
inflation, the relationship between —in a way , the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient 
than the price Phillips curve does.  But we do still see some relationship , and that ’s what you’ re 
seeing in those numbers. 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC.  You’ ve used the analogy t o 
1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I ’m wondering if we can sort of continue 
the analogy.  Within seven  months of those ’ 98 rate cuts, t he Fed took them back and then som e.  
So, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place 
now where we ’re at a neutral rate —“take back ,” I mean if those risks that you say we ’re 
cushioning from don’ t materialize in the way you think—or is this now a new sort of steady state 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 26 
 for the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and 
don’t need to take those rate cuts back? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So there ’s similarities, conceptual similarities , I think , between th e 
two instances during that long expansion, I guess in ’95 and ’ 98, when the Fed cut three times 
only to resume raising rates.  And the notion just is that it ’s a—the economy needed slightly 
more accommodative policy , but it wasn ’t the end of the expansion, right?  And that ’s the same 
situation we believe we ’re in here.  So this is that we did, in fact , turn out to do three rate cuts .  
That wasn ’t in the plan, you know , in any kind of specific way at the beginning.  So that ’s 
the same.  
What ’s diffe rent is , you have a very different —you have very different structural 
characteristics in the economy , particularly around inflation.  So now, as you can see , inflation is 
barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50- year lows and expected t o remain 
there.  So the need for rate increases is less.  And , by the way, this is —it’s a good thing that , you 
know, we think we can —I think we ’ve learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels 
for an extended period of time without unwanted upwa rd pressure on inflation.  In fact, we need 
some upward pressure o n inflation to get back to 2 percent.  It ’s quite different in ’ 95 and ’ 98 
when there were those two adjustments.  S o, I would say, similarities and differences.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  The BIS  conc luded in— I did the same thing as Howard.  Michael 
McKee, Bloomberg radio and television.  The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike 
was not a one -off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that 
could lead to a r ecurrence.  I ’d like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings . 
And, given that we ’re approaching year -end for the markets , will you be taking any extra 
steps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets?   There was a report 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 26 
 yesterday  from  Credit Suisse suggesting there ’s a good chance that we will see disruptions , and 
one of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T -bills, and the 
market wants to sell coupons .  Do you have any plans to sell coupons?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’m going to take a little step back, and I will— I will get to your 
specific questions on the year -end and on T -bills.  So I guess I want to start by stressing that 
these are very important operational matters but that are not like ly to have any macroeconomic 
implications.  We ’d decided back in January to remain an ample -reserves regime, and that means 
we will be setting the federal funds rate —the range for the federal funds rate through our 
administered rates and not through active  management of the level of reserves.  We ’re 
committed to robustly implementing that framework , as you can see by our actions.  And the 
purpose of all this, let ’s remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be 
transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short -term rates.  We have the 
tools to accomplish that , and we will use them.  The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all 
volatility , particularly in the repo market.  
So, taking you back, this —as you know , we h ad very gradually allowed the balance sheet 
to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July.  
Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of 
the reserves,  and said , “Wha t’s your lowest comfortable level of reserves? ”  We got those 
numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer , and it came out sort of at a level that was well 
below where we were in September.  And yet we saw , actually , in September that reserves —the 
markets acted as though reserves had become scarce.  
So what had happened was that liquidity , which actually existed , didn ’t flow into the repo 
market , and that had effects on the federal funds rate.  So the question is, why did that happen?  
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 26 
 And we ’ve been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened.  T here 
are—there are  payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues 
raised —we ’re looking carefully at those.  We ’re open to ideas for modifying supervisory and 
regulatory practice in ways that don ’t undermine safety and soundness , and a number of ideas are 
under —under  examination there.  To go through it sort of by—in time, we started off , really , on 
September  17 with overnight operations .  By October 11 we had cr eated and put into effect a 
plan.  T hat plan is in effect.  It ’s working.  I think , for the last couple of months, repo markets 
have been functioning well, short -term rates are stable, markets are functioning.  
So you asked about year -end.  T emporary upward pressures  on short -term money market 
rates are not unusual around year -end.  And our —both our repo operations and Treasury bill 
purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal 
funds rate.  We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the 
details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.  Our 
strategy has been —essentially , the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term 
through—through both overnight and term repo, a nd, at the same time, we ’re raising the 
underlying level of reserves through bill purchases.  I ’ll take that now.  
We’ve said bills —bill purchases.  We’ve also said that we were willing to ad apt our 
strategy.  We ’re not at this place , but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short -
term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if —if the need arises.  So —but we 
don’t—we don’t —we ’re not in that place .  It looks —it very much looks li ke the bill —so those 
bill purchases are going well , just according to expectations.  I mean, the other thing I ’ll say is 
that we ’re in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time.  We ’ll be 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 26 
 providing— we’ll be continuing that , and we ’re prepared to adjust our tactics.  We’ re—we’re  
focused on—on year -end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  The follow -up to t hat would be , where are we with the possibility 
of a standing repo facility?  
CHAIR POW ELL.  So, on the standing repo facility, as you know , we’ve actually had a 
couple of meetings where we’ ve discussed that.  I think the standing repo facility is something 
that’ll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place.  At the moment 
what we ’re focused on is, you know —we ’re now focused on year -end.  I should also mention 
that after the  year -end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because 
of bill purchases , as that happens , there will come a time when it will be appropriate for 
overnight and term repo to gradually decline.  We don’ t know —we can ’t know today what the 
timing of that will be , but that ’s the way —that’s the way  we see it going over time.  
HEATHER L ONG.  Heather Lo ng from the Washington Post.  A number of your 
colleagues have said explicitly that they do not think the FOMC should raise interest rates until 
core inflation is back at 2 percent.  They think there should be a rule.  Where do you personally 
stand on that ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as I mentioned , actually , at the last press conference, we think 
our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in 
keeping with our —with our  outlook.  And in order to move rates up, I would want to see 
inflation that’ s persistent and that ’s significant —a significant move -up in inflation that ’s also 
persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns.  That ’s my view. 
HEATHER LONG.  S o is this de facto policy of the C ommittee then?  I guess I ’m 
wondering why it ’s not sort of codified in a statement.  
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 26 
 CHAIR POWELL.  We haven ’t—we haven’t  tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, 
official forward guidance.  It happens to be my view that that ’s what it would take to want to 
move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times.   Just 
following up on Heather ’s question —so if you look at the SEP today, it looks l ike inflation is 
never overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are 
increasing in 2021.  So, I guess , how do we square that circle , with interest rates increasing 
before inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think what you’ re seeing is, you’ ve got a full year of the median 
being flat , which is , we think, accommodative, modestly accommodat ive, and inflation not 
moving up very much, as we’ ve discussed.  And that underscores , I think , the challenge of 
getting inflation to move up.  The C ommittee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 
2 percent , for—ever since I arrived in 2012.  And it hasn ’t happened, and it ’s just —it’s because 
there are disinflationary forces around the world , and they’ ve been stronger than, I think , people 
understood them to be.  
In terms of those out -year rate increases, what ’s you’ re—you ’re looking at rate in creases 
more than a year into the future , and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why 
they do that, but we —really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like 
in 2021.  So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that , over time , it would 
be appropriate —if you believe that the neutral rate is 2½ percent , it would be appropriate for 
your rates to move up in that direction.  I will also say to you that a number of people wrote 
down, and you can’ t see this at this level of detail,  but—today —but a number of people did write 
down overshoots of inflation as appropriate —under appropriate policy.  
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 26 
 BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times.  Given that 
inflation —whichever measure you choose —ha s either sort of remain ed where it is or not 
increased over the past year as you ’ve been dropping the policy rate , what is it that gives you 
confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you 
just indicated th at some people are considering doing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, it ’s just that there is still, empirically , by many, many 
different —by the work of many different analysts , there is a relationship between resource 
utilization , by which I mean unemployment , and i nflation .  It’s just relatively weak.  And, by the 
way, that ’s not a bad thing.  T hat means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have 
a historically good—in some dimensions —labor market without having to worry about inflation.  
It also means, though, that it’ s not easy to move inflation up.  
Now, you say, why is there confidence?  I mean, I would say there ’s more humility than 
there is confidence in this at this point.  It ’s been very challenging to get inflation to be at target.  
If you look ar ound the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but 
still hasn ’t quite been able to achieve it.  And I would also point out that this year , which has 
been a good year for the economy, inflation —core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, 
whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year.  So it’s —it’s a real challenge, and— but I 
think we ’re using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos , the Wall Street Journal.   So, Chair Powell, I want to 
ask about the framework review , which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing 
an overshoot of the 2 percent target.  And in that —in that context , is merely saying that you want 
inflation to rise above 2 percent a  sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or 
would it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 26 
 outcome if that ’s the direction in which the C ommittee goes ?  In other words , it’s one thing to 
accept inflation rising on its own opportunistically.  B ut if inflation does not materialize , would a 
change in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I —you know, I think the answer to the questio n of whether 
saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer  to that is “ no.”  And I think you have to back 
that up with policy that supports the outcome , and that ’s what we ’re trying to do.  And so the —
the changes that we ’re looking at to the framew ork are —I think they take all of that on board, 
and—but they’ re—what they’ re—what they are  designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of 
that—of that  inflation target, but only if followed by policy.  Ultimately, it will take time to 
establish —to move  inflation expectations up from where they are , which appears to be a bit 
below 2 percent , will not happen overnight .  It’ll have to happen over time as credibility is built.  
You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility , but inflation expectations ar e anchored at about 
their 25- year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  We talked a lot about inflation —Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business Network.  We talked a lot about inflation.  I want to ask you about uncertainty.  With 
the House announcing that they will ratify USMCA and Canada and Mexico signing off on it, do 
you see that uncertainty easing now so the business investment could pick up, or are the trade 
tensions with China just that big elephant in the room where you might not see those business 
investments pick up?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I did see the news today that it appears there ’s an agreement to 
move forward to vot e on USMCA, and, of course , it’s not our role to comment on particular 
trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them.  I will say , though, that 
getting—if the deal were to be enacted , then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 26 
 uncertainty, and that would be , I believe , a positive for the economy.  And I ’ll say the same thing  
about the negotiations with China, which haven ’t reached that point yet.  
We’ve been hearing from our people that we talked to—the many, many people and 
businesses that we talked to in—through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the 
Beige Book, and they’ ve been telling us all year —for a year and a half , really , that trade policy 
uncertainty is weighing on the outlook.  And I do think that, again, without commenting on it —
in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think tha t uncertainty —removal of 
uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Is one uncertainty bigger than the other ?  Is—do you see —not 
commenting on the deals themselves , is one uncertainty—  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I thin k you can—you know, it ’s—I think you can see that 
what ’s been moving—one way to look at it is , what ’s been moving financial markets ?  It’s been 
news about the negotiations with China, not so much USMC A.  I think the difference between 
NAFTA and USMCA is —is smaller than the difference between current, you know, 
arrangements with China and what ’s being negotiated.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi, Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, the Fed 
policy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the infla tion side of the mandate 
and the need to shore up inflation expectations.  But it seems like the message you ’ve been 
getting from the Fed Listens  events and also something else you’ ve recently acknowledged is 
that, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout 
this expansion.  So I ’m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the 
review is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well.  Are there any possibilities, you 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 26 
 know, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to 
unemployment?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So the —you know, the focus really is on how to use our 
strategi es, tools , and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate.  And you’ re right, 
though, that we ’ve talked here a lot about inflation.  And I think that the —I think , more broadly, 
over a period of years —many years —we ’ve been learning that the natural  rate of unemployment 
is lower .  It’s just been —it’ s in estimates not just at the Fed , but among —broadly among 
economists —labor economists have seen that the connection —that we can sustain much lower 
levels of unemployment than had been thought .  And, as I  mentioned, that’s a good thing 
because that means we—we  don’ t have to worry so much about inflation.  And that ’s—and you 
see the benefits of that in today ’s labor market.  
I—you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they 
are about maximum employment.  If you’ve —if you’ve  listen ed to or attended any of those, the 
discussion —we always focus on inflation as well , but the discussion is really around what ’s 
happening in low - and moderate -income communities and among small businesses.  And I think 
you—you get a perspective , which —you know, we were already getting that from our extensive 
outreach to community groups and such.  But it was help to get —helpful to get it in  the context 
of a monetary policy review.  And I think that the fact that these communities have so much—
such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there 
is slack out there.  And I think that does also infor m our understanding of what we mean by 
“maximum employment .” 
And it’s been a very positive —I would say that the Fed Listens  events have been —have 
been  extraordinarily positive , and they’ re certainly something w e’ll repeat.  You also see from 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 26 
 the business p erspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to —you know, to look 
through things on people ’s résumés that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of 
environments, training is moving up—you hear just a lot —there are a lot of things  going on that 
suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, 
which is a great thing.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.  T hanks.  Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly —is there any 
way to sort of systematize these insights , do you think, with, you know, in terms of —we talk a 
lot about , for example , makeup strategies on the inflation side .  Is there anything similar you 
could do on the employment side?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I —I think we have kind of internalized —and this isn’ t—
this isn’t news for today, this is something we ’ve been saying for, you know, for several years —
you’ve seen us moving down our estimates of the —of maximum employment.  In fact , it’s 
already —it’s already understood, I think, that —that  there ’s more —even though we ’re at 
3½ percent unemployment , there ’s actually more slack out there, in a sense.  A nd—and the risks 
of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool , to explore that are relatively low.  
And I think we know that , and I think the review certainly underscores that , but that’s —that ’s a 
very important insight.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask more about the —
the repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations.  Ar e you currently, 
for example , telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes?   
Are you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their 
account at the Fed?  And on the standing repo facility , is it, you know, that you would be 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 26 
 inclined to do it , but you need to figure out the details ?  Or—or what would kind of drive the 
decision on whether or not to do that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we ’ve done a ton of work on that.  
We’ve talked to supervisors , and—it ’s interesting, if you look at the banks, they’ re all over the 
place on the composition of their —of their  buffer.  So you have to have —you have a business 
model , and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be , and that suggests 
what your buffer should be.  And you see them making quite different choices.  Some of them 
have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer T reasuries, and then they change their mind and they 
switch, so i t’s not obvious that  there ’s one thing happening there.  Notwithstanding that, we 
have —we’ve gone out to try to understand that , talking to supervisors.  
In terms of the —the  TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet ; 
we’ve taken it as exogenous.  I don’ t know that at some point we won’ t have those discussions , 
but, you know, Treasury —we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs.  And then 
we should—we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our —to our  work .  And, you know, 
there may come a time when we —when we  talk about that, but we haven’ t done much of that.  
Standing repo facility—so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it?  What 
are we—I mean, I —so I think we’re —we are more focused , frankly, on the T —the bill 
purchases, t he year -end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we ’re 
digging into, and—because we think, you know, there ’s—these are structural things —right? —
where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the —allow the  liquidity 
that is already there to flow more freely , perhaps by making fairly straightforward, 
noncontroversial changes .  And we think there is some of that , though—a nd so we ’re working 
hard and fast.  But those are things, you know, the —if they take rule changes, it ’ll take, you 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 26 
 know, a notice of public rulemaking—i t’ll take three  months and things like that.  Those things 
take time.   These things that we’ re working on now , though—like, you know, going through 
year-end with the overnight facilities and the  bill purchases and the term repo—those are —those 
are things we have to do right now and are doing.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.   I wanted to ask, 
the only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the 
economy.  You seem very confident that —or it implies there ’s a lot of confidence that those 
uncertainties have gone away.  What caused you to make that change for the  statement?  What 
were you looking at that  seemed to be so much lower ? 
CHAIR POWELL.   Well, we did , actually —if you look at the statement, you’ ll notice 
that we —we  did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the 
statement.  And why did  we do that?  You know, those are the things that we ’ve been monitoring 
all year.   We ’ve put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things , 
so we ’re not revisiting that.   But those are —those are  just key things , and they haven’ t gone 
away , so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there —still subject to the idea that, for 
us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Well, just to follow real qu ick, on the material—material  
reassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year?  
We were talking about rate hikes, but no—no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next 
year.  Some economist s do.  Does a  material reassessment mean you need to see data actually 
worsen?  Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way , arguably, you did this year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So,  I mean,  one thing that we ’re mindful of is that we ’ve cut rates 
three times since Ju ly.  That ’s 75 basis points ’ worth of cuts.  And we do believe that monetary 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 26 
 policy operates with long and variable lags , and that it will take some time before the full effects 
of those actions are seen in the economy.  So that ’ll take some time.   So that ’s one reason to hold 
back and—and  wait.  And we thought —I think we took strong measures.  In fact, if you look 
at—more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points.  So 
you’ve—you’ve  had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation. 
In terms of what ’s—you know, what is material at the end of the day, w ell, I would just 
say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective 
judgme nt of the FOMC.  There isn ’t any single factor that will determine our decisions.  We’ll—
we’ll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook. 
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR.  You started out 
by talking about Paul Volcker , who obviously cast a —a long shadow.  I wonder if , in hindsight , 
that shadow was—was  too long, and if —in the decades since his tenure and , in particular, last 
year, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack  an inflation bogeyman that didn ’t 
materialize.  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I —this wouldn’ t be a —my response will not be about Paul 
Volcker , but—so, well, you started with Paul Volcker.  So, if you look back at 2018 —I’ll just 
take you back to the beginning of 2018.  We had an economy growing at 3 percent , we had 
inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars ’ worth of stimulus arriving, a nd the 
federal funds rate was 1.4 percent.  So it wasn ’t that —so we moved—we moved policy up 
during the course of  the year.  We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the 
neutral rate was at th e time.  So there was no sense of it being restrictive.  We took steps to make 
it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing.  It still seems to m e to be the right 
thing in hindsight.  The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down—w e 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 26 
 were really just trying to get near neutral.  A nd even with the last rate increase a year ago, we 
were still meaningfully below the median estimate o n the Com mittee of what the neutral 
rate was.  So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year.  
I think what ’s happened is , the—obviously, the facts on the ground have change d.  You 
saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then 
continue to go on this year, so you’ ve seen a continual weakening.  Just look at the IM F’s 
forecast s of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now.  You’ve had 
quite a significant —that does affect us.  I think , also, the trade situation was just beginning in the 
middle of ’ 18, and I think it had —has had—you know, I think the re’ll be a very, very wide range 
of estimates of the effect , but I think it ’s had a meaningful effect on output just through the 
uncertainty channel and,  to a lesser extent , through—through, you know, the tariff effects.  And , 
again, that ’s not to make a judgment.  It’ s not up to us to make a judgment about that.  So, that ’s 
what —that would be my  story.  
DONNA BORAK.   Chair Powell, D onna Borak with CNN.  To follow  up on Edward’ s 
trade question , could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if 
negotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy 
in that event?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I wouldn’ t want to speculate on —on a hypothetical .  I 
would say—we’ll just have to see.  W e’re—we look at a range of factors and we ’ve—as I ’ve 
said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news  and trade negotiations.  We t ry not 
to react.  We can ’t react.  Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short  term to 
volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth a s this has 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 26 
 happened, as is probably typical of a —of a  large complex negotiation.  So, in terms of —you 
know, I —again, I don’ t want to get into hypothetical outcomes , though, if that ’s all right. 
DONNA BORAK.  I’m just wondering, you met with the President last month.  Did you 
have any advice for him when it c ame to this, and did you express some concerns about the 
potential volatility and the impact of the economy on—given all this?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I —I’m going to stick with my and my predecessors ’ 
longtime practice of not discussing private meetings w ith elected officials—or other officials , 
really .  But thank you. 
VIRGINIE MONTET.  Thank you.  Virginie Montet with Agence France -Presse.  
Yesterday, Democratic leaders in the House have launched an impeachment process against the 
President.  Have you mentioned these developments within the Committee, as —today as 
potentially presenting some risks for their confidence in the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No.  We have not.  We don’ t consider things like that.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Mike Derby with Dow Jones News wires.  Does the Fed ’s dot plot 
still serve a useful communications purpose , or do you feel that it might be time to retire  it or 
change it in some fashion?  
CHAIR POWELL.  With —I think properly understood, it can be useful , but that ’s been a 
challenge.  You know, I think “ properly understood”  to me means looking at what it is and not at 
what it isn ’t.  And what it is  is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee 
members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.  Remember tha t we 
write all that down , and we send it in , and it gets compiled.  But we don’ t discuss it at the 
meeting , and we don’ t negotiate a plan.  There is no—t here’s no agreement.  There ’s no plan.  
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 26 
 And I think, particularly at inflection points, it’ s hard to convey the reality , which is that 
policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook.  
And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are —they’re just not a consideration.  
We’re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy.  And if the fact —dots that 
we did six  months ago or three  months ago don’ t agree with that, that ’s not even in the 
conversation.  So its more —but it can it be useful if —and I think—but , as I said, it ’s been a 
challenge , and so I —I do—I do like to say , if you focus too much on the dots, you can—you can 
miss the broader picture.  
GREG ROBB.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chairman Powell, many people seem 
worried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be —the results are going to 
be less rather than more.  And I —people keep coming back and saying why—asking why you 
took off , like , a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started.  I mean, as you said , 
going around the country for all the Listen  events, I don’ t think I heard anybody worry about a 
4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem.  So where 
does that concern come from?  Is it members of Congress that have—have  said this?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No.  S o let me say , we’re—we’ve been working on this all year.  
And we ’re just at the stage where we’ ve had a really interesting discussion about the various 
tools that we have at the October meeting.  At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary 
policy affects different groups in the economy.  So we had a —we talked about the Fed Listens  
events and some very interesting research.  So we ’re just getting to the stage where we ’re 
looking at conclusions .  You know , what do we take away from all this?  And those things —
many of those things would wind up as changes , if you will, modifications to the “Statement of 
Longer -Run G oals and Monetary P olicy S trategy. ”  I think that process will take until the midd le 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 26 
 of the year where —but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully.  And that is —
in effect, that is our framework document.  And I wouldn’ t prejudge.  No one —I believe we will 
be able to —to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements.  I do. 
In terms of “ 4 percent ”—so that ’s—I think it ’s premature for people to be saying that this 
isn’t going anywhere.  You know —and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation 
target—let me talk about the 4 percent inflation targe t.  So I ’ll go back to the point that just 
saying words is not itself credible.   So I think if you said, “W e’re raising the inflation target to 
4,” what would be the effect of that?  I mean, where’ s the credibility in that, really?  You haven’ t 
been able to get it to 2.  So I think we —I think you need to lower your sights a little bit.  I also 
think, is 4 percent —you ’d have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability?  Is 
that really price stability?  Is that within our legal mandate?  I mean , I think it’ s a fair question.  
So, you know, I think— I’d like for this review to come out with very— a set of positive 
results—you know, meaningful improvements.  It doesn’ t mean it has to solve every problem 
going forward.  We want to —we want to  have this be a successful exercise where we 
meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework.  These things don ’t tend to move in —
you know, in a lurchy way, t hey tend to evolve.  But I think —and if we do this , then in a few 
years, again and again  and things like that , then we can —at least we’ re moving in a good 
direction.  And I think we will be.  I’m confident we will be.  
DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.   Chair Powell, you’ ve had a busy year , and I ’m 
wondering, as you look back, what things you might have done differently.  A nd are there any 
lessons that you would take into next year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know , I have to say, my total focus is on right now and 
getting policy right and thinking about next year —you know, thinki ng about what ’s the economy 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 26 
 going to be doing.  I like where we are on policy,  as I mentioned.  I think our policy stance is 
appropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this.  You know —I 
mean, it ’s too long of a question.  Yo u know, I don’ t know how to get after that.  There ’s—
there’s  a lot of learning that comes into—from the economy every year and in the way we do our 
jobs.  And, you know, we ’re always going to be trying to learn lessons.  
DON LEE.   I mean, are there any part icular surprises, whether it ’s the economy or how 
markets or financial — 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I—s o, ye s.  I didn’ t—obviously, you know, didn’ t see and I 
don’t think anybody saw coming the —the  challenges that we faced this year.  I think they were a 
surprise.   I think that , toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense the economy was growing at 
around 3 percent.  And I didn’ t expect the —to face the challenges, but I think we did face them , 
and I think we —I’m pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did.  I 
think our moves will prove appropriate.  And , again, I think both the economy and monetary 
policy right now , I think , are in a good place.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   I’m Nancy Marshall -Genzer from Marketplace.  
Chair Powell, wh y aren ’t we seeing stronger wage gains?   Wages are growing more slowly now 
than they were toward the beginning of the year.  Why is that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, wage gains have moved up a bit.  If you look back three , four  
years, you’ ll see wages are growing around 2 percent.  Now you see them moving up, you know, 
more at 3, 3½  percent.  So why aren ’t they growing higher, at a faster rate?  And it ’s a couple of 
things.  I think there are a range of explanations.  For instance, one would be that productivity 
has just been low.  So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity.  Productivity has 
been low , and that —that is very likely to be holding back wages.  I also think there are other 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 26 
 possible potential explanations , such as, you know, globalization can be —the idea that you can 
make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world.  I 
think that hangs over the wage -setting process— and everywhere , pretty much.  You don’ t see—
there i sn’t the kind of traction in the wage market that—even in a tight labor market. 
Another thing is , though,  that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it 
was.  And, you know, I think there —there are many, many possible explanations.  I will say , 
though, if you look, for example , at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are —
their wages are going up at 3.7 percent.  And so, you do see —and wages are going up the most 
for people at the lower  end of the —that ’s been true for the last couple of years —lower  end of the 
wage spectrum.   So you do see wages moving up.  It’s  just—they’re not moving up at —at very 
high rates.  And, again , at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Can I ask  a quick follow -up?  Just as far as the market 
not being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who 
could join the labor force?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, y es.  And I would also say that we —if you ask people, and we 
did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is?  People were writing 
down numbers in the fives , and then they were writing down numbers in the fours.  And now, 
unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half , and we still s ee wage inflation , as you 
mentioned.  The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, a lthough, there may be 
compositional effects in that number that may—that may  be, to some extent , about younger 
workers coming in at lower wages that —than retiring w orkers . 
But you wouldn’ t—that shouldn’ t have much of an effect , actually.  So why is that ?  It 
may just be that there ’s more slack in the economy.  And I think we are seeing that.  We’re 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 26 
 seeing —really , it showed up through higher participation.  For many years, we’ve  thought that 
there ’s a trend decline in participation.  Notwithstanding that, against that trend , we’ve seen 
prime -age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two  or three  years.  And it’s a 
very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor 
market.  
HANNAH LANG.   Hi.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.   Thanks for being here 
today.  I just wanted to ask about the Community Reinvestment Act , since the FDIC and OCC 
may pot entially join together with a —for a proposal without the Fed.  Are you concerned that 
this might cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized 
without the Fed?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we think the CRA —we know the CRA is a very 
important law , and we ’re strongly committed to the mission of e nsuring that banks provide credit 
to their—throughout their communities , particularly addressing the needs of low - and moderate -
income households and neighborhoods.  We also think it ’s time for modernization.  We ’ve 
thought that for some  time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC , really , 
on—on a proposal.  And my hope is that we can still do that .  You know , I don’ t know whether 
that’ll be possible or not.  It will have to —well, we’ll just have to see , but—and if we —if we  
can’t, I don’ t—I’m not sure what the path forward would be.  We would certainly not want to 
create confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be 
slightly different regimes.   So that ’s something we —I hope we don’ t have to face , but we will if 
we have to.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi there.  Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  So , before the July 
meeting, you said something kind of colorful.  You said, “ To call something ‘hot,’ you would 
December 11, 2019   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 26 
 need to see some heat, ” referring to the labor market.  So to expand a bit, I guess , on Nancy’ s 
question, it seems like the wage Phillips curve has been pretty well explored already , but what 
would you need to see to call the labor market “ hot” in that case?  Would it be a contract —or, 
rather, some sort of change in either the headline number of gains or in t he unemployment rate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Really, wages.  I mean, we —there’s so many other measures that 
suggest that the labor market is —I like to say  the labor market is strong.  I don’ t really want to 
say that it ’s tight.  Someone asked me a question about a  hot labor market —that was in the 
Humphrey- Hawkins hearings.  S o I’ll say that the labor market is strong.   I don’ t know that it ’s 
tight, because you ’re not seeing wage increases, you know.  Ultimately , if it’s tight, those should 
be—should be  reflected in  higher wage increases, so it does come down to that.  You know, we 
look at countless measures of labor market —you know, labor utilization, and there ’s so many —
it’s too many to count.  But the one that has —that is kind of suggesting that you’ re—it’s a 
healthy number that, you know, the  sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a 
decent number —3.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy.  
Ultimately , though, we ’d like to see —to call it “ hot,”  you’ d want to see heat.  You ’d want to see, 
you know, higher wages.  Thanks.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
January 29, 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone.  Thanks for being here.  At today’s 
meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged.  As always, we base 
our decisions on our judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us :  
maximum employment and price stability.  We believe monetary policy is well positioned to 
serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a 
return  of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal. 
The expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record.  Growth in household spending 
moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat 
consumer confidence, the  fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.  In contrast, 
business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the 
past year.  Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in 
these sectors.  However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and 
there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid -2018.  
Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those pose d by the new 
coronavirus.  Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate 
economic growth to continue.  
The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for well more than a year, and 
the pace of job gains remains solid.  Participation in the labor force by people in their prime 
working years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade.  And wages have been 
rising, particularly for lower- paying jobs.  People who live and work in middle -income 
communities  and low -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are 
now finding new opportunities.  Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 28 
 ethnic groups and all levels of education.  These developments underscore for us the importance 
of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  
Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months 
through November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and c ore inflation, which excludes 
volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent.  Available data suggest similar inflation 
readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few 
months as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation.  While low and 
stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can 
lead longer -term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower.  In turn , 
interest rates would be lower as well —closer to their effective lower bound.  As a result, we 
would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the 
detriment of American families and businesses.  We have seen th is dynamic play out in other 
economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States.  
In particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support 
sustained economic growth, a strong labor market , and inflation returning to our 2 percent —
symmetric 2  percent objective.  As long as incoming information about the economy remains 
broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain 
appropriate.  We will be monitoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with 
other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for 
the federal funds rate.  Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of 
our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course.  
I will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to 
implement monetary policy.  The plan the FOMC announced back in October to purchase 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 28 
 Treasury bills and conduct repo operations has proceeded smoothly and has succeeded in 
providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effectively controlling the 
federal funds rate.  In light of the resulting stability in the fed eral funds rate and money market 
conditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to 
administered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range.  This 
action reverses the small downward adj ustment made in September when money markets were 
volatile.  
As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample 
conditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede.  Over the first half of 
this year, w e intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from 
their active use in supplying reserves.  This process will take place gradually , and, as indicated in 
today’s FOMC directive to the Desk , we expect to continue offering r epos at least through April 
to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves.  Based on current projections, we expect that 
the underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter 
of this year.  As we get close to t hat point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition 
to a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves 
without the active use of repos.  At that point, as in the pre -crisis period, our balance sheet  will 
be expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and 
other Federal Reserve liabilities.  
All of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective 
implementation of monetary policy and are not intended to represent a chance—a change in the 
stance of monetary policy.  We are committed to completing the transition to our longer -run 
ample -reserves regime smoothly and predictably.  Of course, we will continue to closely monitor 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 28 
 conditions in money markets , and we will adjust these plans as conditions warrant.   Thank you, 
and I ’ll be happy to take your questions. 
CHRIS TOPHER CONDON.  Thank you.  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr. 
Chairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth about one small change I’ve 
noted in the statement.  It notes that policy will be appropriate to bring—the Committee 
belie ves—inflation back to the Committee ’s 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.  That’s a 
slight change from the last time , when you w ere expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back 
near the objective.  And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last 
press conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had 
projected inflation overshoots two or three years out under appropriate mone tary policy.  Should 
we take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2  percent 
outcome for inflation is already baked in the cake , or that this is a signal that the Committee has 
a stronger resolution to bring inflat ion at least to the 2  percent objective and put —bring into play 
an informal makeup strategy for inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So, in making that change, our goal was , really —that was, 
changing “ near” to “returning to ”—was to avoid possible misinterpretat ion.  So you may 
remember , in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the 
language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near  2 percent  could be 
misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfor table with inflation running below 
that level.  
So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be 
appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we’re not comfortable with 
inflation rising persistently —running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective.  So, 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 5 of 28 
 yes, there is something in that.  It’s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 
2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around—symmetrically around 2 percent , and 
that we ’re not satisfied  with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now 
where we’re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low 
unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Than k you.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   I want to ask 
about the balance sheet.  How many reserves are “ample ”?  How many reserves does the Fed 
now think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework?  And can you walk me through 
how you and your colleagues are arriving at that answer?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, thanks for that question.  Why don’t I say a few things 
about repos , since I know that’ll be of interest.  So , just to bring you back, after last September’s 
brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action , and a result —as a result,  money markets have 
been operating smoothly since then.  Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill 
purchases of at least —of $60 billion —sorry—at least in to the second quarter, and term and  
overnight repo at least  through April.  And I will get to your specific question. 
The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly 
to the federal funds rate, which requires well -functioning money markets.  It doesn’t mean we’re 
trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets.  We know that some volatility is normal and 
expected in well -functioning markets.  And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been 
successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves.  Money markets operated smoothly, 
including right through year -end, and the fed funds  rate has remained in our target range.  So we 
know —we will know when these adjustments have run their course  when reserves are durably at 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 28 
 a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest 
on reserves and reverse repo , without the need for frequent use of open market operations. 
Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the 
underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year.  And 
when we see that we’ve reached that level, we’ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to 
the level of the unde rlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities.  As our bill purchases bring 
the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity 
of overnight and term repo will gradually decline.  We’ve already begun the gradual reduction in 
the quantity of repo, and we’ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions 
permit.  At some point, we’ll also raise the minimum bid rate.  Even after we reach an ample 
level of reserves, it’s possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support 
effective control of the federal funds rate.  And we’ll continue to discuss that issue and review it 
under our implementation framework. 
Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that 
reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range 
depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account , or 
TGA.  In particular, reserve levels will ne ed to be at a level high enough to remain ample even 
when the TGA peaks during the April tax season.  Effectively, what that means is that we need 
reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September —and, I would say, around 
$1½ trillion , subject to learning more.  Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I 
mentioned, and we want to be clear , that will be the bottom end of the range.  We want 
$1½ trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range.  So, most of the time , reser ves will 
be moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below $1½ trillion . 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 28 
 So it’s not an —it’s not something that we’re aiming at all the time.  We know that 
reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the time.  We also want 
interest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC’s target range.  
And we think that’ll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment.  
Last points —we’re committed to making this adjustment process a smooth one.  We’ll 
provide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go , as we always have.  And we’re 
prepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary 
policy implementation. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.  
Following up on Nick’s question, I know you said it’s not QE , but it’s $390 billion over 
five months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet.  I guess I’d ask one more time on Nick’s 
question— is there a number that you have in mind?  
Secondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE , and 
they’re trading that way.  Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE 
program , and that the rise in the stoc k market is linked to it , and you may then experience 
something of a “ taper tantrum ” the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I’ll just—I’ll repeat that —we think that the —we think we need to 
continue purchases until the —until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below 
$1½ trillion , roughly, during the course of the calendar year.  And we know that the TGA will 
move up and down there .  So they’ll be much higher than that some  of the time , but that’s kind 
of the number , and we think we’ll reach that sometime in the second quarter.  That’s our 
estimate.  But we will— we’ll know it when we get there.  We’ll know it because we’ll be able to 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 28 
 be—to control the federal funds rate without use of —without active use, ongoing use of open 
market operations.  
You know, our intention of these —for these adjustments is just to raise the level of 
reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner.  And 
that’s —that is our sole intention.  I pointed out on other occasions , more than once , the 
differences —the really specific differences between this and the large- scale asset purchase 
programs.  We’ve been over that.  
In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets.  It’s very 
hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets.  What I can tell you is that 
you know what our intention is.  It is to return reserves to an ample level.  We expect that to 
happen during the second quarter.  And our plan as we do that is , as those purchases get to that 
level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce 
repo as—as we reach an ample level, as we’re satisfying demand now more from underlying 
reserves from bill purchases rather than from repo. 
And, again, the last thing I’ll say is , we’re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as 
we’ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   I 
was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market.  We’ve recently seen wages 
moderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others.  As you 
mentioned, at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it see ms like we are seeing those wages 
climb up a little bit, but it doesn’t seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average.  I was 
wondering if you’d  talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks , or whether 
you’re worried about tha t, or how you’re thinking about it.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 28 
 CHAIR POWELL.  The l abor market continues to—to  perform well.  The labor market 
continues to be strong.  We see strong job creation.  We see low unemployment.  Very 
importantly, we see labor force participation continuin g to move up, really , against expectations.  
If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecast s suggesting that we could have 
been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population 
that we’re seeing n ow, let alone the  unemployment level.  So I think we’ve learned quite a lot of 
good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there’s been more room to run. 
The performance of wages, I think , has to be seen in that context.  We saw —if you go 
back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at 
around 2 percent, and now they’re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about 
where th ey might be at full employment.  It would consist of inflat ion plus —plus  productivity 
growth.  The —it’s a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment , 
we haven’t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and 
other periods of low unemployment. 
So you a sked, what can be explaining that ?  You know, one thing can be that the natural 
rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would 
appear just from the 3½ percent number.  And the other can be , I think , that —as I mentioned, the 
sort of supply- side shock or surprise that we’re receiving from higher labor force participation.  
People are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply , and that is —that ’s a 
great thing.  That’s a very healthy thing.  We’re a country that has low labor force participation 
compared to  essentially all of our advanced -economy peers , and it’s a very good, positive thing.  
Nonetheless , it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages.

 MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  In terms 
of the framework review and a little bit on Chris’s question earlier, there is a general feeling now 
in the markets and among analysts that you’re basically setting us up for some form of inflat ion-
target averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to 
make up for the time that it has  spent below that.  Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where 
you think you’re going to end up?  What would you, Chairman Powell, think of that idea 
personally ?  And, as long as I’m asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect 
the results of the review? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  I’ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt , 
and I felt , that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the “ new normal ” into 
our policy framework.  And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful 
global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower -than-target infla tion many places in the 
world; s econdly, a flat Phillips curve , by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to 
resource utilization —for example , low unemployment; a nd, thirdly, a much lower neutral real 
interest rate here and around the world.  So those ar e challenging conditions for monetary policy 
to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would 
say that , under our existing framework, we’ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it 
for most of the tim e lately to achieve those goals , although we do struggle , as other central banks 
do, with the inflation goal.  
So this is about reviewing our strategy , tools , and communications to assure that they’re 
the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this envi ronment on a sustained basis.  And we 
continued our discussions at this meeting.  I’m very, very pleased at the process so far.  It’s 
included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we’ve engaged with a full range 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 28 
 of people and groups across American society.  That was a very, very positive experience, and I 
think we learned a lot.  We ’ve now had a series of —a number of FOMC meetings at which 
we’ve reviewed what we’ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy , tools , and 
communications.  I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions 
around the middle of the year.  Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all 
that together. 
So I think I’m not the person who should be telling you my personal pr eferences right 
now.  I’m trying to—a nd we were trying to come together as a group around a  set of answers.  I 
feel very positive about —that we’re going to come up with some good results, and I’m just 
going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them.  
DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Going back to your outlook for global 
growth, we’ve seen some significant headwinds , as you mentioned earlie r, with the easing —with 
the partial U.S. –China trade deal , but now that there’s some new concern fo llowing the outbreak 
of the coronavirus —that it might shake global growth.  We’re already seeing reports from Ford 
and Toyota that they’re planning to shut down their assembly plants for an extra week.  Apple is 
rerouting their supply chains.  Starbucks is  shutting down close to thousands of stores.  Are you 
worried at all about what the impact would be  on the U.S. economy, and do you see that as a 
significant risk —excuse me—to the outlook at this point ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me talk about the coronavirus s pecifically, and then I’ll turn 
more to global growth more generally.  First, it’s a —it’s a  very serious issue , and I want to start 
by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already 
causing.  There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 28 
 the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already 
been imposed. 
Of course, the situation is really in its early stages , and it’s very unce rtain about how far 
it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading 
partners and neighbors and around the world.  So, in light of that uncertainty, I’m not going to 
speculate about it at this point.  I w ill just  tell you that, of course, we are very carefully 
monitoring the situation.  
And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is , what are the potent ial 
ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate ?  More broadly, 
though, if I can talk about the global economy for a second— and if you look at the backdrop, 
you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the 
middle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last 
year.  The fourth- quarter growth globally was quite weak last year , and a number of factors 
played into that.  It wasn’t any one factor.  There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but 
also there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial 
excesses.  There was a turn —downturn in the global high -tech manufacturing cycle in global 
auto production.  There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina , 
Turkey.  A nd then, later,  in Hong Kong and Chile , you had social unrest.  So, all of those things 
were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the cours e of 2019 and the last half  
of ’18. 
I would say,  now there are grounds for what I would call “ cautious optimism ” about the 
outlook now for the global economy.  Many analysts are predicting a pick up in growth this year, 
although still to relatively modest growth rates .  And I would—people are pointing to , and we 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 28 
 would point to, support ive financial co nditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a 
hard Brexit.  The high- tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia, 
including in China.  The latest indicators —manufacturing PMIs , for example —suggest that 
manufacturing may have bottomed out , that they’re still below 50 in many jurisdictions , but they 
have moved up off of their lows.  
I would—I would just say, none of this is assured.  As I mentioned, we saw the fourth 
quarter of last year came in quite weak —weak er than ex pected.  We are not at all assured of a 
global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it.  And then comes the coronavirus , 
which, again, it’s too early to say what the effects will be.  Of course, we’re, as I mentioned, 
monitoring it carefully.  There will clearly be implications , at least in the near term , for Chinese 
output and, I would guess , for some of their close -in neighbors , and we’ll just have to see what 
the effect is globally.  
BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times.   As recently as 
2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band, sort of dragging the fed funds rate 
up.  Over the course of the adjustments since last year , it’s moved steadily down, closer to the 
bottom of the band.  So, if you’re moving it back up, how high do you want to get it?  Are we 
looking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves 
to the middle of the band?   And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we’re 
approachi ng “ample ”? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well 
within the range.  That’s it.  W ell within the range.  And that , clearly, you know —5 basis points 
from the bottom or from the top isn’t that.  So that’s why we moved back up.  You’re right.  Last 
year we were—we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system.  We saw 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 28 
 the—gradually moving up.  And, in hindsight , we know what was happening.  With ample 
reserves, we see—we see that it’s possible to bri ng the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis 
points.  So now we’re —now we are well within the range, I would say. 
BRENDAN GREELEY.  We are.  So you don’t think that , as the fed funds goes back up 
towards the center of the range , that IOER is going to end up at the top?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Don’t know that.  We want  it to be well within the range.  I think 
we’ll continue to adjust it to the extent it’s appropriate.  Ultimately , what we’re trying to do is 
deliver a federal funds rate that’s well within the range .  IOER is just a tool to do that.  If we —if 
we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we’ll do that .  It just means —I mean , 
the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate —which is the rate 
that, of course , transmits into other money market rates , which ultimately transmit into all kinds 
of financial conditions —that’s what we care about.  So, ultimately, we will —we will  use that 
tool to keep it well within the range.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schnei der with Reuters.  Just to sort of 
close the loop on one thing, w here do discussions stand on a standing repo facility?  Because 
what you’ve  said so far sort of implies that there won’t be one or that it will be  a limited  one.  So 
if you could just, you know, let us know where that discussion stands.  And also—  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  Can you turn mic over?  Turn the mic over. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that .  Did you get the question?  
Did you hear the question okay?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I did.  I don’t think —I’m not sure your colleagues did.  [Laughter]  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Where do the discussions  stand on standing repo?   [Aside]  
That was great.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 28 
 And the other thing is , on the, you know , on the standing repo facility and on the 
purchases— Treasury bill purchases, as you enter this new regime later in the second quarter or 
later in the year, w ill that be preannounced by amounts?  Will the re be preset amounts like 
you’re doing now , or will that just be something that people will have  to sort of intuit and figure 
out as you go along?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I’ll go in reverse order.  When we —when we  make decisions 
about the steps we’re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some 
length, we’ll be making them as earl y as we can and as transparently as we can —and 
specifically.  But we’re not at that stage.  It’s January , and we’re several months away from —
from  that.  
In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned  in, I guess , in my answer to an 
earlier question,  there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we’re at an ample-
reserves level.  Now, we haven’t decided what that role is, we have not decided —we haven’t at 
all made a decision on a standing repo facility .  We haven’t.  We ’ve had a couple of discussions 
about it , as you know , back in, I guess , June and October.  And there’s a range of views .  We’re 
going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question.  
And I think it was wise to wait, because we’re still getting a better sense of what that —
what that  world looks like.  And, you know, it’s really going to be a question of , how useful will 
it be?  What will be the costs and benefits?  And my thinking is , we will return to that fairly 
soon, and I wouldn’t assume a decision one way or the other .  Really , we haven’t made one , 
because we haven’t had to .  And I think you—when you delay, you get more information by 
waiting.  It’s good to wait.  We don’t have any urgency in making that decision, because we’re 
still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we’re in an ample -reserves regime.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 28 
 HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  I’m wondering, do you 
think that there is a financial stability risk from climate change?  Yo u’ve spoken several times 
that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring 
what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that ’s sort of one institution.  
Do you think there’s a systemwide risk that may —that could develop from climate change?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that’s an interesting question—the  question being,  is there a 
systemwide financial stability risk?  I’d say , over —over  the longer term , it’s certainly possible , 
and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we’re thinking about climate change as an 
institution.  So, as I’ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue , 
but it’s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federa l government and state 
governments for leadership on that.  And, importantly , society’s overall response to climate 
change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed. 
All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we’ve got a monetary polic y mandate and, 
more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we’re supervising financial markets, 
utilities , and financial institutions , banks .  And we haven’t —we share overall responsibility for 
financial stability with a number of agencies.  And that latter part—I think the public has every 
right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust 
against the risks from climate change.  
Now, I think that’s got to be right .  We are in the very early stages, as are other central 
banks , in understanding just what that means.  And there’s quite a lot of work going on around 
the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through.  But I do think it’s —in 
that sense, it has to be part of our role , and—but not the overall response of society to climate 
change.  That’s not us.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

 HEATHER LONG.  And if I could follow up, can you clarify why the Fed hasn’t signed 
on to the Network for Greening the Financial System  like 40 other central banks have?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we’ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them , and 
we’ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that .  We 
probably will do that at some point.  So that’s —that’s  an ongoing question.  B ut we’re  very 
much attending those meetings and taking part in them . 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business Network.  So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today.  M id-
February, the phase- one China dea l gets —goes into effect.  Have you seen business investment 
pick up at all?   If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty 
is—is being cleared up?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So I guess I’d start by saying that the fact that we’ve reached a 
phase -one deal with China and the fact that we’ve moved ahead closer to getting USM[ C]A 
agreed —those are potentially positive things for the economy without question.  W ithout 
question.  And financial markets —the reaction of financial marke ts is very consistent with that 
perception.  A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment , 
investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy.  
It’s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things.  First, trade policy uncertainty 
remains elevated.  Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk.  We still have two or 
even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now.  So it hasn’t 
gone away, and we’ve just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments —
sorry, contacts in the business world.  And I think, clearly , these are seen as positive 
developments going forward, but there’s a bit of a wait -and-see attitude —is this going to be 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 28 
 sustain ed?  The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that’ll take quite some time.  So, I 
would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy.  
There’s also the global economy.  You could—you could well see manufacturing—as I 
mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced 
economies and emerging market economies.  We do not see a decisive recovery, but it’s possible 
that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur 
further growth. 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Hi, Mike Derby with Dow Jones .  Do you have any greater sense 
of what —what  was going wrong with the repo market starting in September?  There seem ed to 
be, you know —whether it was a one -off event, you know, too tight around tax payments and 
debt settlement , or whether there’s a more enduring issue going on with the market, more 
structural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector . 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  As for those forces, so , as we indicated , we would undertake a, 
you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory 
practices.  A nd we’d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow 
more easily in the system as long as it didn ’t undermine safety and soundness.  And so we’ve 
undertaken that , and w e’ve done a ton of work, a ctually .  We don’t have anything to announce 
here today , but I feel good about the —what we’ve learned there.  I think —you mentioned other 
factors.  W e will be announcing our findings.  I’m not going to give you a time, but we’re —
we’re  well along in that assessment at this time.  
I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to 
conduct our operations without frequent reso rt to open market operations was higher than we had 
thought and was higher than others had thought, too.  We learned that we can’t let reserves —we 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 19 of 28 
 shouldn’t let reserves go below $1½ trillion —roughly, the level of early September —at any 
point.  And that me ans that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that 
will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion] , but they won’t ever go below.  So $1½ [trillion] 
is not a target level .  It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be  expected to move. 
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Mr. Chairman .  I just wanted to ask about how your 
balance sheet operations and repo—temporary repos —how they affect the system and who 
they’re helping.  Clearly, they’re mostly designed, as you said, to get —keep the fed funds rate in 
the range you’re looking for.  But , certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds 
and other Wall Street institutions .  And so, how would you explain to, sort of, Main Street  why 
you’re doing all this for that market?  And how would you address criticism that it is helping 
mostly Wall Street, along with everything else?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important 
reason for ca ring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are—our 
monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets —through the money 
markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions.  So we care  that 
money markets are operating smoothly.  A nd they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in 
September.  And so we acted.  This is a one -time thing that we’re doing to adjust the level of 
reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smo othly on an ongoing basis.  
Repo markets are important , because that’s where Treasury securities—the purchase of 
Treasury securities, which is the way —you know, the federal —part  of the way the federal 
government is funding its operations.  It’s the way thos e are financed.  So these are largely 
Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to —for distribution to —and buyers , to a 
substantial extent .  That’s what’s going on in the Treasury repo market.  So it’s just the financing 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 28 
 for—for that.  Now, a gain, we don’t —that activity is a —is a market activity.  We’re not looking 
to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all.  What we care about is that 
volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of —of our policy decisions t o federal 
funds rate , and that really is important for the public.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, is the Fed going to vote tomorrow on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks 
investing in venture ca pital funds?  What can you tell us about what the Fed is considering?  And 
why make those changes?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a —a new part 
of—part of  the existing Volcker rule , and that is the covered fund provisions  of the rule .  And 
we’ll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and 
the spirit of the law.  We’re going to put those proposals out for public discussion, a nd we’re 
going to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals.  Again, we 
believe that they will be —and you’ll see them tomorrow —will be public —you know, will be 
publicly—we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Now, is this just the venture capital f unds, or are also 
you changing the rules for hedge funds and private equity funds ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  It’s covered funds.  It’s —so it’s th at covered —so it’s not the 
proprietary trading part of Volcker .  It’s the covered funds part. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And is there a chance that banks could take this and 
run and maybe even get involved in mortgage -backed securities again and risky investments? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we’ll —we think that what we’re doing is —is very 
consistent with safety and soundness and ab solutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 28 
 Volcker rule.  We’ll be —we’ll be  getting comments from people, and we’ll be looking into that 
question, among many others.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman Powell.  I’d like to turn your atte ntion 
back to China and the health of its financial sector in particular.  And I guess I’m basing my 
question on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month.  Just —in March 
of that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, a nd one of your colleagues on the 
FOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt —hit the U.S. 
economy.  And the staffer said that there was a —what they were worried about was that not only 
was the Chinese economy slowing down, but there was the financial sector .  And the quote was :  
“There’s a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China.”  Now, I was wondering if you could 
give us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector .  And how do you think it 
might impact the economy, particularly now that they’ve been hit by this unexpected shock?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that 
period—2014 up until, I guess, ’17 or ’18, a nd I thought —which was essentially just a lot of debt 
for an emerging market .  For an economy at the —at th e stage of evolution of the Chinese 
economy, they had very high levels of debt —not sovereign debt the way we think of it , but more 
business debt —debt  of state- owned enterprises and also just private businesses.  
And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control —to stop 
the growth and to control it.  And that —as I mentioned, that’s one of the reasons why Chinese 
growth slowed, and it’s one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that.  And 
they’ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you 
know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing.  The authorities have stuck to that 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 28 
 and have, again, continued to t ry to do that , so—to try to control the growth of debt .  And that’s 
important that they do that.  
We don’t think that —that there’s any imminent risk there , although you—as you point 
out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will —will have some effects on the 
Chinese economy, at least in the short term.  The Chinese economy is very important in the 
global economy now.  And, you know, we —when China’s economy slows down, we do feel 
that—not as much as countries, though, that are near Chi na or th at trade more actively with 
China, like some of the Western European countries.  We still have —you know, 85 percent of 
our economy is domestic.  And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other 
economies just because of our phys ical location.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi .  Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Fi nance.  So the combination of 
T-bill purchases and repo operations have been described colloquially as “ liquidity .”  I’m just 
wondering if you semantically agree with that description —then, seco ndly, what the impact of 
that has been on risk assets.  I don’t know if that’s something that , you know , the Board or 
Reserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been.  H ow 
are you kind of thinking about that going forward?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so , two questions.  I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what 
we’re doing is what I said :  We’re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that 
banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that t here’s enough reserves in the system that we 
don’t see reserve scarcity , and we don’t have to use repo operations to provide additional 
reserves.  So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace 
sometime in the second quarter.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 28 
 In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it’s very hard to say what is affecting 
financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time.  It’s not our intention to 
change the stance of monetary policy.  These were designed to provide more reserves and, really , 
to do that in order to enable better transmission of our —of our  rate decisions into the economy 
under our chosen framework.  That’s really the purpose of what we’re doing. 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi .  Jean Yung with MNI.  I wanted to ask about the framework review 
again.  Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period—would that call for a different 
policy stance if you made that shift?  And whether or not we know the answer to that question, 
would the Fed consider changing the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was 
no change to the economic outlook?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, we’re comfortable with our current policy stance.  
We think it’s appropriate .  We think it’ll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are 
broadly in keeping with our outlook.  Over time —over time , though—let me take a step back.  
Over time, an average inflation -targeting framework would be different than our current 
framework , in the sense that it wouldn’t be  a—there would be some aspect of trying to make 
inflation average 2 percent over time, which means , if it runs below 2 percent for a time , it has to 
run above to bring the average  up.  So that is a different framework. 
Our current framework is one where we say —or we’d  be equally concern ed with 
deviations of inflation from target on either side.  But that isn’t—that doesn’t suggest an 
intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric.  In other words, that would—
consistent with  that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we’ ve had, 
actually.  So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 24 of 28 
 approach to policy.  Again, I’m not trying to—I don’t want to comment on the current stance of 
policy, whi ch we do think is appropriate.  
DON LEE.  Don Lee with the L.A. Times.   I wanted to ask you about the stock market.  
By historical comparisons , as you know, valuations are considerably high.  And I just wonder 
how much discussion and concern you and your colleagues have about that and what risk s you 
see for the economy.  
CHAIR POWELL.  S o we —we look at a very broad range of financial conditions 
where —there isn’t any one financial condition that we —that we  look at.  And when we look at 
financial conditions, wh at matters for the real economy is substantial changes in —or, material 
changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time.  
If I can, maybe I’ll —maybe I’ll  answer that in the context of our overall financial 
stability framework.  That’ s one way to look at it.  So we look at —when we look at financial 
stability, we look a t—really, we’ve got four pillars to that, t he first of which is leverage in the 
financial system that is at a comfortable level.  Our banks, particularly our  large banks, have high 
levels of capital.  
The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and 
businesses.  Households’ debt to GDP is —has been coming down since the financial crisis.  It’s 
not moving up.  It’s at low —low  levels compared to what it was before the crisis.  So not every 
household— but, in the aggregate , household debt is in a good place, a very good place.  Business 
debt has been moving up.  We’ve been calling that out for more than a year —substantially more 
than a year, and it’s something we’re focused on.  A nd we’ve taken appropriate measures and are 
monitoring carefully.  But we think it’s not something that would threaten financial stability , but 
more be an amplifier.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 25 of 28 
 The other one is asset purchases, gett ing to your —sorry, asset prices, getting to your 
question.  We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated —I do —somewhat elevated .  If 
you look at risk spreads, they’re narrow .  If you look at P /Es, they’re high.  I think the way to 
think about —a good way—one way to think about equity prices , though, is , what’s the premium 
you’re getting paid to own equities rather than risk- free debt ?  And that’s also at fairly low 
levels, but not extremely low levels.  So valuations are high, but not at extremes.  
The final factor is funding risk .  Are  big financial institutions and other players in the 
financial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk?  And the answer is , very 
stable funding, for the most part.  So if you look at , overall —wh at you see , in my view , is, 
vulnerabilities to the financial—to financial stability are moderate overall.  
KATY O’DONNELL.  Hi .  Katy O’Donnell, Politico.  I wanted to know, do you support 
Governor Brainard’s vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform ?  And is this 
something that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that I think this is a good time to do—to update CRA, 
really, in a way that is a win –win both for the intended beneficiaries —low - and moderate -
income communities —and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about —about  
what does and doesn’t qualify and that sort of thing.  The law can both be more effective and 
more efficient is —it comes down to.  A nd we think this is a good way.  It’ s also just a good time 
to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and 
demographic change as well.  
We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies.  We 
think that an interagency f inal rule together would be the best outcome.  We’re sorry we haven’t 
been able to get there , and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to.  We spent a lot of 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 26 of 28 
 time on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform.  You saw Governor Brainard’s 
recent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis.  And we haven’t made a ny 
decisions about what we’re going to do, about whether we’ll propose —I mean, our focus has 
been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really.  So we haven’t made any 
decisions about what we’re going to do going forward. 
In terms of, you know —Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these 
activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high 
priority for us.  I was comfortable with her speech, and I’m comfortable with the work we’ve 
done and with the Fed’s position on this.  As I said, we haven’t chosen to bring a proposal 
forward.  We haven’t decided what to do, whether —going forward.  And we’ re not going to 
comment on the other proposal.  It’s just not appropriate to do.  It’s not about us.  It’s not about 
our views.  It’s about the views of the interested parties.  
HANNAH LANG.  Hannah Lang with American Banker.   Thank you for being here 
today.  I wanted to ask about Vice Chair Quarles’s recent speech on bank supervision in which 
he laid out some suggestions for making changes to the supervisory regime.  I wanted to ask, do 
you agree with his approach ?  And are there any plans to codify some of  these suggestions later 
in the year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I do agree that —the principles that he articulated of firm and fair 
supervision and effective transparency in communications.  I also think it’s a good thing that we 
would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory  portfolio, which we haven’t really 
had to date.  Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn’t mean 
that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change.  
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 27 of 28 
 So—and I also thought that, you know, the —he’s raising some very interesting questions 
about , if you —in the first part of the speech, where he’s talking about regulation and supervision 
and, you know, how to—how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in 
everything the government does wi th the needs of confidential supervision.  It’s a very 
challenging question.  It’s one that could use further thought.  And as far as the specific, you 
know, proposals, there’s —you know, they’re interesting, you know, a nd need further  
development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing. 
MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Sorry, I had it [the microphone]  upside 
down.  That’s not too good. 
Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate .  Thank you.  I want ed to ask you a question 
about the —one of the unintended consequences over the years- long low interest rate 
environment , and that is that savers haven’t gotten as much return as would have otherwise been 
the case.  What would you say to those individuals who’ve seen the Fed again cutting rates, 
eroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings?  And how much would you take their 
plight into consideration?  How much can you sympathize with them?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we —we  are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use 
our tools t o pursue maximum employment and stable prices.  And that’s what —that’s our focus.  
Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it’s a powerful one.  So I think if you look—
look at the time since the financial crisis.  T hat was —in the week [wake] of  fairly modest 
growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market.  And part of that just is the effect of 
lower interest rates.  So, if —so many, many people benefit from low interest rates.  In fact, you 
don’t hear —when you talk to the low - and modera te-income communities, one thing you don’t 
January 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 28 of 28 
 hear is, “You ought to raise rates. ”  That’s not what you hear.  You hear quite the opposite, 
which is, you know, “P lease do whatever you can to keep this expansion going.”  
I absolutely sympathize with people.  If  you’re living on just the interest in a bank or on 
fixed -income generally, then that’s a challenging thing.  On the other hand, if you own a home, 
home values —the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so —but , 
yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be 
challenging.  I mean, we have to do what’s best for the —for the  overall society and the economy.  
That’s —those are our orders from Congress.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
March 3, 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Earlier today the Federal Open Market Committee announced a 
½ percentage point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, bringing that  range to 
1 to 1¼ percent.  My colleagues and I took this action to help the U.S. economy keep strong in 
the face of new risks to the economic outlook.  
The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.  The unemployment rate has been 
near half -century lows for well more than a year , the pace of job gains has been solid, and wages 
have been rising.  These strong labor market conditions have underpinned solid household 
spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth over the past year.  At the time of 
our FOMC meeting in Ja nuary, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, 
and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.  
Since then, the spread of the coronavirus has brought new challenges and risks.  The 
virus has afflicted many  communities around the world, and our thoughts and prayers go out to 
those who’ ve been harmed.   The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many 
countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.  The virus and the 
measures th at are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and 
abroad for some time.  We are beginning to see the effects on the tourism and travel industries, 
and we are hearing concerns from industries that rely on global supply ch ains.  The magnitude 
and persistence of the overall effects on the economy, however, remain highly uncertain, and the 
situation remains a fluid one. 
Against this background, the Committee judged that the risks to the U.S. outlook have 
changed materially.  In response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some 
more support to the economy.  Of course, the ultimate solutions to this challenge will come from 
March 3 , 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 7 
 others, particularly health professionals.  We can and will do our part, however, to keep the U.S. 
economy strong as we meet this challenge.  As always, our actions are guided by our 
congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  
In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor developments and 
their implications for the economic outlook, and we will use our tools and act as appropriate to 
support the economy.  Thank you, and I ’ll be happy to take a few questions. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal.  Two 
questions .  First, w hat changed between last week , when many of your colleagues seemed to 
indicate it was still too soon to tell how this might influence the outlook —what changed between 
last week and today?  And then, how much confidence do you have that there wi ll be a quick and 
relatively complete recovery of economic activity after the peak of this virus has passed? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, what changed?   Of course, we ’ve been carefully monitoring the 
situation since it first became known and waiting to see how it would evolve .  And I think we ’ve 
come to the view now that this —that it is time for us to act in support of the economy.  A nd once 
you reach that decision, we decided to go ahead.  So what changed, really , was, I would say, over 
the course of the last coup le weeks, we’ ve seen a broader spread of the virus—we ’ve seen it 
begin to spread a bit here in the United States .  But, for us , what really matters , of course , is not 
the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy.  So we saw a risk to the outlook for the e conomy 
and chose to act.  In terms of my confidence that we will return to —what was your question?  
Was that a question?  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  How do you expect this to —the economy to recover from this ?  Do 
you see it as a persistent decline in activity or somet hing that will be relatively temporary and 
short  lived?  
March 3 , 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 7 
 CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t think anybody knows how long it will be.  I do know that the 
U.S. economy is strong, and we will get to the other side of this.  And I fully expect it will return 
to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.  
JIM TANKERSLEY.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  Jim Tankersley, New York Times.   You said 
that “ the ultimate solutions ” will come from others, and I have two questions about that.  First, is 
this a coordinated—part of a coordinated action with other central banks , and should we be 
expecting to see more as part of that?  And , second, what would you like to see from American 
fiscal policymakers in response to these new threats? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay .  So, first question .  We—we’ re in act ive discussions with 
central banks around the world on an ongoing basis , as you would guess.  I’ve been in regular 
contact with central bank leaders from around the world.  That will continue.  Central banks are 
doing what makes sense in their particular i nstitutional context s, but we ’re all talking to each 
other on an ongoing basis.  And our action today represents what we think is the right policy for 
us in our particular institutional context under our domestic mandate.  You saw this morning’ s 
G-7 statem ent of finance ministers and governors , and I think that statement does reflect 
coordination at a high level in the form of a commitment to use all available tools, including 
health -care policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy as “ appropriate. ”  
So, in terms of fiscal policy, again , not our role .  We have —we have a full plate with 
monetary policy.  N ot our role to give advice to the fiscal policymakers , but you saw the mention 
in the G -7 statement —as “ appropriate ” as well.  
HEATHER SCOTT.  The G -7—Heather  Scott with AFP.  The G -7 statement seemed to 
indicate that —I’m sorry .  I was away from the mic.  Sorry, Heather Scott with AFP.  The G -7 
statement seemed to indicate that —that policymakers would use tools but were not going to do 
March 3 , 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 7 
 anything imminent.  Does this contradict that , or is this in keeping with the action—the statement 
by the G -7 this morning?  And , can I ask , what would cause you to make —take another step?  
What would you be looking for , in terms of the economic outlook or data?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So t he sense of the G -7, you know, is to —we have seven countries, 
obviously, and different policies, different situations, different mandates —a lot of overlap .  And 
the sense of that is to get together as a group and say at a high level  that “These are the th ings 
we’re going to do.  W e are going to use our tools —all of our tools in a strong way to—to  try to 
support the economy.”   So that ’s a statement of general support.   I think within that you will see 
actions.  Y ou’ve seen our action.  And I think it ’s up t o individual countries —individual fiscal 
policies and individual central banks —to do what they ’re going to do.  I would think it will be —
it’s possible there will be some more— more  formal considered coordination as we move 
forward. 
In terms of—in terms of  moving forward, I would say that we do like our current policy 
stance.  We think—we think it ’s appropriate to —to support achievement of  our dual -mandate 
goals.  But as I said in my —in my  statement, we’ re prepared to use our tools —tools  and act 
appropriately, depending on the flow of events. 
HEATHER SCOTT.  But any thing you’ll be  particular ly watching that would 
change  that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I can ’t point to any one thing.  It’ s always a range of things.  
HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the Washington Post.  There ’s been some rising 
concern about credit markets and possible insolvencies and defaults either from businesses or 
individuals from the coronavirus.  Can you speak to—is the FOMC talking about this?  Are we 
March 3 , 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 7 
 likely to see any emergency provisions from the CRA activated or things that you normally do 
during, you know, a hurricane or that type of disruption to the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we don’ t—we don’t  see any of that happening yet.  Of course, we 
are—we are thinking about what we  can do should those things happen.  There ’s no evidence of 
it yet.  The economy continues to perform well —perform well.  As I mentioned, we do hear 
concerns, particularly from those most directly exposed, but there ’s nothing in that nature :  
Financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner and all that sort of thing.  I think when 
it—when it  comes to those sorts of issues, though, we will be —the supervisors will be working 
with banks to assure that they work with their —with their borrower s and that sort of thing.  S o I 
can imagine us doing those sorts of things, but it’s —those things are not upon us at the moment. 
BRENDAN GREELEY.  Thank you.  Brendan Greeley, Financial Times.   Has the 
Committee discussed any other monetary policy tools , in addition to rate cuts , and the pacing and 
timing of when they might be appropriate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, we ’re in the middle of a review of all of our 
tools.  So if you go back a few meetings , we’ve talked about what our toolkit is , and we ’ve put 
that in the minutes.  But in the current context, no.  What we discussed is the current stance of 
policy, is it appropriate —came to the view that it was appropriate to make a change and went 
ahead and did that today.  
RICH MILLER.  Hi.  Rich Miller wi th Bloomberg.  Thank you very much for having a 
press conference.  Can you take us  a little —through the reasoning behind the rate cut a little bit 
more in depth?  You know, w as there a discuss— some economists say this is a s upply -side 
shock, you know, rate  cuts are not particularly suitable for this .  Others say , well, the supply 
March 3 , 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 7 
 shock may morph into a demand shock.  I wonder if you c ould just  give us a little bit more depth 
on the reasoning behind the rate cut.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure, I ’d be glad to.  So t he virus outbreak is something that will 
require a multifaceted response.  And that response will come , in the first instance, from health -
care professionals and health policy experts.   It will also come from fiscal authorities should th ey 
determine that a response is appropriate.  And i t would be —come from many other public - and 
private -sector actors:  businesses, schools, state and local governments.  But there’s also a role 
for monetary policy.  Monetary policy can be an effective tool  to support overall economic 
activity.  We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection .  It won ’t fix a 
broken supply chain.  We get that.  We don’ t think we have all the answers.  But we do believe 
that our action will provide a mea ningful boost to the economy.  More specifically, it will 
support accommodative financial conditions and avoid a tightening of financial conditions which 
can weigh on activity , and it will help boost household and business confidence.  That ’s why 
you’re seeing central banks around the world responding as they see appropriate in their 
particular institutional context.  
YLAN MUI.  Thanks.  Ylan Mui from CNBC.  Can you tell us what you would do if the 
virus ends up being contained fairly quickly?  Would you envision the Fed actually raising rates 
in short order if the economic damage doesn ’t occur the way that you potentially fear ?  And I 
have a second question, which is, President Trump was just tweeting about you this morning and 
talking about the Fed’s need t o cut rates.  Did you feel any political pressure to make this move? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, on your first question, we ’re always going to set monetary policy 
at a given time in a way that we think best serves our dual -mandate goals, and it ’s as simple as 
that.  So , you know, we’ll —if we get to a place where we think it ’s an appropriate time to change 
March 3 , 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 7 
 the stance of monetary policy , we won ’t hesitate to do that.   I would also say that it ’s—it’s  very 
important that people understand that we wil l always make our decisions based on the best 
thinking we have, based on our—what we learned from our outreach to businesses, nonprofits, 
educational institutions that we get every cycle through the Reserve B anks, and the best analysis, 
the best research .  We’re always going to make our decisions in the interests of the American 
people to carry forward and try to achieve the mandates that Congress has given us.  And we ’re 
never going to consider any political considerations whatsoever.  We will not do that,  and it ’s 
very important that the public understand that.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I know —you 
mentioned a little bit of outreach.  Some of the Fed B ank presidents were talking about last week 
how much they were going to listen to their contacts.  Have you gotten reports sort of from the 
ground from your business contacts, nonprofits , and so forth that have affected your 
decisionmaking?  What are—what are  you hearing from all those folks?   Thank you. 
 CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re —we are hearing —I would just say , the effects are at a 
very early stage.  But you are hearing concerns from people —for example, in the travel business 
or the hotel business and things like that.  That’s —that’s  what you are hearing.  But you don’ t 
see things showing up in actual data.  You do see them showing up in, sort of , sentiment forecast 
indicators and things like  that.  We expect that will continue.   It will probably grow.  And that’s 
one of the reasons why we ’ve come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move 
to support the economy.  And that’s what we ’ve done.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  Call  
March 15 , 2020  
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good evening, everyone.  Today the Federal Reserve took a number 
of actions to support American families and business and the economy overall and to promote 
the flow of credit as we weather disruptions caused by the coronavirus.  The virus is having a 
profound effect on people acr oss the United States and around the world.  On behalf of my 
colleagues at the Federal Reserve, our first concern is for those who ’ve been harmed.  
Families, businesses, schools, organizations, and governments at all levels are taking 
steps to protect peopl e’s health.  These measures, which are essential for containing the outbreak, 
will nonetheless understandably take a toll on economic activity in the near term.  While the 
primary response to this challenge will come from our health -care providers and poli cy experts, 
economic policymakers must do what we can to ease hardship caused by the disruptions to the 
economy and to support a swift return to normal once they have passed.  
The Federal Reserve ’s role is guided by our mandate from Congress to promote 
maxi mum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities 
to promote the stability of the financial system.  Today we reduced the target range for our policy 
interest rate by 1 percentage point, bringing it close to zero, and said that we expect to maintain 
the rate at this level until we’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on 
track  to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  In addition, we took other 
actions to support the flow  of credit to households and businesses.  
Before describing our actions more fully, I will share how my colleagues and I currently 
view the economic outlook.  The economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.  
The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half -century lows 
for almost two years.  Job gains have been running at a solid pace, well above what is needed to 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 21  
 provide jobs for new entrants into the labor market.  Participation in the labor force by people in 
their prime working years remained near its highest rate in more than a decade.  And  wages have 
been rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.  Overall economic activity has been expanding at 
a moderate rate, even though weak growth abroad and trade d evelopments have been weighing 
on some sectors.  U.S. banks are strong, have high levels of capital and liquidity, and are well 
positioned to provide credit to households and businesses. 
Against this favorable backdrop, the virus presents significant economic challenges.  Like 
others, we expect that the illness  and the measures now being put in place to stem its spread will 
have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term.  Those in travel, tourism, and 
hospitality industries are already seeing a sharp drop in business.  In addition, the effects of the 
outbreak are restraining economic activity in many foreign economies, which is causing 
difficulties for U.S. industries that rely on global supply chains.  The weakness abroad will also 
weigh on our exports for a time.  Moreover, the energy sector has recently come under stress 
because of the large drop in global oil prices.  Inflation, which has continued to run below our 
symme tric 2 percent objective, will likely be held down this year by the effects of the outbreak.  
Financial conditions have also tightened markedly.   The cost of credit has risen for all but 
the strongest borrowers, and stock markets around the world are down s harply.  Moreover, the 
rapidly evolving situation has led to high volatility in financial markets as everyone tries to 
assess the path ahead.  In the past week, several important financial markets, including the 
market for U.S. Treasury securities, h ave at times  shown signs of stress and impaired liquidity.  
The market for Treasury securities is a critical part of the foundation of the global 
financial system.   It is generally the most liquid of all markets and serves as the benchmark by 
which many other fin ancial assets are valued.  It plays an important role in allowing households 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 21  
 and firms to earn a safe return and manage their risks.  When stresses arise in the Treasury 
market, they can reverberate through the entire financial system and the economy.  To prevent 
this from happening and to support the smooth functioning of the Treasury market, we 
announced today that we will purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities over the 
coming months. 
Similar stresses have also emerged in the market for agency mortgage -backed securities, 
which is closely linked to the Treasury market and critically supports the ability of people to get 
a mortgage to buy a house or refinance an existing mortgage.  To improve the functioning of this 
market and to ensure the ef fective transmission of monetary policy to borrowers in the economy, 
we will also purchase at least $200 billion of agency mortgage -backed securities over coming 
months and immediately cease the runoff of these securities in our portfolio.  While the prima ry 
purpose of these securities purchases is to restore smooth market functioning so that credit can 
continue to flow, the purchases will also foster more accommodative financial conditions. 
The Federal Reserve announced a number of other actions today to s upport the flow of 
credit to households and businesses, thereby promoting our maximum employment and price 
stability goals.  Of these, I will highlight two.  First, we reduced the interest rate on discount 
window loans by 1½ percentage points, bringing tha t rate to ¼ percent.  The discount window 
plays an important role in supporting liquidity and stability in the banking system, and we 
encourage banks to turn to the discount window to help meet demands for credit from 
households and businesses.  To make th e discount window more effective, we will also offer 
discount window loans for periods up to 90 days.  
Because of the importance of the U.S. dollar in the global economy, strains in markets for 
borrowing and lending dollars overseas can disrupt financial conditions here in the United States.  
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 21  
 To guard against such disruptions, the Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with five major 
central banks.  When dollar funding pressures emerge abroad, those central banks can contain the 
pressures in their jurisdictio ns and prevent them from impeding the flow of credit here at home.  
To address potential pressures in these markets during the current period of elevated uncertainty, 
we made a coordinated announcement with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank 
of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to reduce the pricing on our 
dollar swap lines.  In addition, our central bank counterparts will begin offering dollars to 
institutions in their jurisdictions for a term of 84 days in addition to the usual one -week 
operation.  These long- standing  arrangements carry no risk to the Federal Reserve or to the 
American taxpayer.  
I won’t go into detail on the other actions we took today, but they involved eliminating 
reserve requirements for banks and encouraging banks to make use of intraday credit with the 
Federal Reserve and to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they support lending to 
households and businesses. 
The actions we have announced today will help American families and businesses and, 
indeed, our entire economy weather  this difficult period and will foster a more vigor —more 
vigor ous return to normal once the disruptions from the coronavirus abate.  We will continue to 
closely monitor economic and financial developments a nd their implications for the economic 
outlook.  We are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to 
households and business, to help keep the economy strong, and to promote our maximum 
employment and price stability goals.  
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 21  
 Finally, let me note that today’s FOMC meeting today was in lieu of the meeting 
scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday.  Thank you.  I’ll be—I’ll be happy to take a few of 
your questions. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  The Chair will now take some questions.  Please dial “ star 1 ” on 
your phone to indicate you want to ask a question.  You will be unmuted when you are called on.   
[Extended silence]  Okay, CNBC.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this —these 
actions to be?  Do you— do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided?  Secondly, 
there was talk about additional programs that could come out —for example, a  Primary D ealer 
Credit F acility or a T erm A uction F acility.  Do you expect those to be announced soon?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So, based on our discussions today and many 
conversations with participants, it ’s fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of 
the economy, as is always the case with the Fed.  But, in general, I’d say that we see the U.S. 
economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus.  We see that it 
is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing 
from or reducing certain activities —thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things —
and that ’s going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time.  These are choices that we 
make to protect ourselves —appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus.  
So that means th at the second quarter is probably going to be weak —in fact, in the view 
of many, output declining —output  lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.  
After that, it’ s very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last .  And that ’s 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 21  
 going to depend, of course , on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly 
uncertain, and I would say , in fact, unknowable.  
We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a 
normal level of activity.   In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the 
flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy —
ultimately , to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible. 
You also asked about other facilities.  I would point out that we have , of course , 
responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today.  And 
we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally.  And as I 
said in my statement, we ’re prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to 
households and businesses.  Thanks.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thanks.  We ’ll go to Marketp lace r adio.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, I ’m wondering , are you considering negative interest rates at this point?   Is there a 
scenario in which you think that would be appropriate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, a s I’ve noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee —
as you know, we did a year -plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications.  
And we , really , at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and 
asset pu rchases—asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as 
the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound—
so, really , forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of thos e.  You know, we looked 
at negative policy rates during the Global F inancial C risis, we monitored the ir use in other 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 21  
 jurisdictions , we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an 
appropriate policy response here in the United States.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’re going to the Wall Street Journal. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  I 
guess I wanted to understand, specifically , how the actions you’ ve announced this evening will  
get credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue.  And 
also, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities 
undertake —again, to make sure that firms with large drops in i ncome and revenue don ’t go bust 
over the next few weeks or months?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me tell you how , I think —what our tools can accomplish, 
and—and  really what they ’re not designed to accomplish.  So what our liquidity operations —and 
I’ll talk specifically about the T reasury and MBS purchases —are designed to do is to assure the 
proper functioning of the T reasury and MBS markets.  The Treasury market is one of the most 
important, perhaps the most important, market in the world.  It’s probably the most l iquid large 
market in the world.  The MBS market is very important:   It’s closely linked to the Treasury 
market , and it’s the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real 
econom y.  So, two very important markets.  And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity , 
and—to the point where we —as you know , last week we offered financing —very large amounts 
of financing.  And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and 
return to normal function.  And we found that that helped, but , nonetheless, we thought we had 
to do more.  And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase program s that we 
did today.  And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function. 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 21  
 Now, why is that important to —to everyone?  These markets are part of the foundation of 
the global financial system and of the United States financial system.  And if they are not 
functioning well, then other markets —then that will spread to other markets.  And those are the 
markets that —that amount to —that —where households and businesses typically get credit.  So 
we know that dysfunctional financial markets —a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have 
very big negative effects on the economy.  We saw that during  the financial crisis.  This is a very 
different situation , but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong 
measures to support —to support  proper market function in these important markets.  
Now, you asked about households.  It’s true, we don ’t have the tools to reach individuals 
and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or 
whose businesses may not —may experience a period of very low activity.  We don’ t have those 
tools.  We have the tools that we have, and we use them.  I think we ’ve used them quite 
aggressively for the benefit of the public.  But this is a multifaceted problem, a nd it requires 
answers from different parts of the government and society.  I mean , I think th at, by far , the most 
important is the response of the health- care workers and health -care policymakers.  After that, 
fiscal policy.  We ’ve had one round of fiscal policy, another coming.  I think fiscal policy is a 
way to direct relief , really , to particul ar populations and groups.  Monetary policy has a role , and 
it really is in , you know —our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when 
they’re under stress , and that’s—that ’s really part of what we did today.  The other role is to 
suppor t demand through lower interest rates, and we did that. 
You—you asked about fiscal as well , and I guess I ’ve sort of covered that.  We do think 
fiscal response is —is critical , and we ’re happy to see that those measures are being considered , 
and we —we  hope they are effective.  
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 21  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’re going to go to Fox Business. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business Network.  In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have 
declined .  The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year , and that ’s become one of the focuses 
of the FOMC meeting s.  Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming , and is this large 
cut meant to get in front of any  more inflation?  Plus, as a second question, would the Fed 
consider buying securities outside of T reasuries and mortgage- backed securities?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.   So, on—on inflation, you know , the—the econom y’s 
performed so well, really , over the last few years , and right up through January :  historically low 
unemployment —50- year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years —almost 11 years of 
expansion so far , and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent.  So we ’ve been concerned that 
inflation not move down further.  It’s not at all a question of deflation.  It was a question of not 
getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.  
So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judge d that the —the  net effects of this will be to —
to have inflation move down e ven a little bit more.  And it’s —it’ s not a question—it’ s not —it’s 
not an issue of deflation.  Again, it ’s just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further.  
We expect, with uncertainty, that , you know —that it will fall a little bit further , at least , below 
where it has been.   We are—of course, we don ’t have the legal authority to buy other securities 
other than the ones we already buy , and we ’re not seeking authority to do so.  We haven ’t 
discussed that at the —at the  FOMC , and it’s not —it’s n ot legal authority that we ’re seeking.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to the Financial Times.  
BRENDAN GREELEY.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  This is Brendan Greeley with the 
Financial Times.  You have talked about the mortgage -backed security purchases and t he 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 21  
 Treasury purchases as a stability —a stability  operation.  I’m pretty sure that every person on this 
call has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing.  How do we 
draw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is 
explicit quantitative easing?  Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So w hat—what  I can tell you definitive ly is what the purpose of the 
asset purchases was , and I mentioned this in my statement.  And it really is to support the 
availability of credit in the economy —households and businesses —and thereby support the 
overall economy.  How do they do that?  They d o that by supporting proper market functioning 
in the T reasury market and the MBS market.  So you see —and I think you ’ll see —as these 
purchases roll forward, you will see the T reasury market and the MBS market returning to 
normal market function , and that will actually support economic activity.  That will be a positive 
for economic activity.  
In terms of what it’ s labeled , that ’s of less interest to me.  I really  think we are very clear 
in our minds what we ’re doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be —
which would be both better market function and— and—you know, when there ’s better market 
function, it will be —you know, policy will be supporting the economy better.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Bloomberg TV.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to ask some timing questions 
here.   First, on the —whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase 
“over coming months.”   Is there a timetable for that?  How long are we talking about —$700 
billion , obviously , over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year.  
And do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program?  
And the same with the interest rate cut to zero —how long do you think that might last, a nd 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 21  
 would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you 
cut it from?  Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, so —sorry.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Mike, can you ask your question?  
CHAIR POWELL.   What was it again ?  W hat was the question again?  Just tell me .  I 
can’t read my writing.  [Laughter]  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  I was asking about timing.  How long a period—  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, okay, great.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  — are we talking about for the QE purchases , and how long do you 
anticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay , sorry.  So that ’s the “ in coming months ” language.   Let me tell 
you what we were doing there.  So there ’s no monthly cap here.  There's no weekly cap.  The 
Desk is going to go out , and it ’s going to buy at a strong rate that is —that we think will restore 
market function—restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored.  And that language is open 
ended , and it’s meant to send a signal to the market that—that , you know, we ’re not going to be 
bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that.  We ’re going to go in strong 
starting tomorrow , and we ’re going to buy across the curve , and we ’re going to buy MBS , and 
we’re really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these 
important markets to normal function.  So that —that ’s really what that is.  
As far as —as the policy rate, what we ’ve said is that we  will maintain the rate at this 
level until we ’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to 
achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.  So, you can see, that ’s the test 
we’ve written down.  And if you—if you  look at it, you’ ll see that some things have to happen 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 21  
 before we’ d consider —we’d have to become confident of —that the economy has weathered 
these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability 
goals.  So that ’s a test we ’ll be looking at, and I think it suggests that , you know , we’re going to 
be watching and willing to be patient , certainly.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’re going to go to the Associated Press.  
CHRIS TOPHER  RUGABER.   Hi, it’ s Chris Rugaber at AP.  In 2008, you had a lot of 
coordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury —Bernanke doing a lot 
of things with Paulson and so forth.  You know, today the White House had its press conference 
at 5:00.  Y ou guys are doing something a little  separate.  Is there —do you think it would be more 
helpful to market s—perhaps , in the broader economy , to have a more coordinated response?   Is 
that something we might look for in the future?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I would say this.  You know, we have differ ent tools.  I think 
we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and—and  cooperate with 
them on things , with clear lines of delineation.  For example, the Treasury Department has 
authority over fiscal policy.  That ’s not our job.  It’s their job , with other parts of the 
Administration.  It’s just that —like that for us with monetary policy.  We have sole 
responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an 
independent, nonpolitical way.  So those two things are —one for each of us. 
But in the middle there, there are areas where we —where we can cooperate.  And also, 
there’ s a long history .  You would want the finance ministry and  the t reasury [and the central 
bank] to be talking in every major econom y in the world.  You would want them to be regularly 
exchanging information—professional relationships not just at the , you know , the Chair -to-
Treasury -Secretary level, but also through the organization.  For example, the New York Fed is 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 21  
 the Treasury ’s agent—fiscal agent , as you know , so there ’s a lot that goes into debt management 
and the issuance of debt , which happens at the New York Fed.  So I think we do, actually —we 
have professional , good working relationships up and down the chain there , and, you know, 
that—that  seems to me to be working.  And  there is —there’ s also quite a lot of coordination in 
other respects  with —of course , with foreign central banks, but you didn’ t ask about that. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay , we’re going to go to the Washington P ost.  [ Silence]  
Washington Post , are you there?  
HEATHER LONG.  Hey, sorry, I ’m here.  I think —hi, Chair Powell .  Two questions this 
evening.  First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus , and are you working from 
home?  If you could shed some li ght on the precautions you’ re taking .  And, second, do you 
believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment , or are you seeking congressional action to 
expand your tool  set? 
CHAIR POWELL.   So I feel fine.  I feel very well , and so there ’s no reason for me to be 
tested.  We are observing —we ’re trying to model good behavior here , so we ’re observing quite a 
lot of teleworking.   And also, we’re— you know , we’re not having a lot of big, crowded 
meetings —we’re not having any big, crowded meeting s.  So we ’re trying to observe all of the 
things that the professionals tell us to do.  I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to 
model that —that it’ s okay for the people to do so.  In fact, it ’s important for them to do so.  So I 
will do that.  
In terms of our —of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know , I think we do have plenty 
of space to adjust our policy.  I mentioned our liquidity tools —you know , we have a lot of power 
in our liquidity tools , and, as I mentioned , we’re prepared to use t hem.   In addition, we ’ve got 
plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies , so I 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 21  
 think we do have room.  We—we  have not at all made a decision to request further —further 
tools or authorities from Congress, no.  We —we  have not made that decision.  It is not 
something we ’re actively considering right now.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to the New York Times.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York 
Times.   Thanks for taking our questions.  I’m just curious —you know, obviously , you held this 
meeting in lieu of your meeting later this week.  Will you still release a Summary of Economic 
Projections ?  And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the 
economy as  the coronavirus shapes up?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So why no —I guess you ’re asking , why no SEP , and what ’s our 
forecast?  So a couple reasons we didn’ t do an SEP.  First, we decided on Thursday to move the 
meeting up by three days to today , and that ’s before the S EPs are generally filed.   They hadn’ t 
been filled out , and we —frankly , we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these 
announcements.  Second, and, you know , a number of FOMC participants had already reached 
out to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis , and it really is 
depending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long 
that goes on.  And that  is just not something that ’s knowable.  So , actually , writing down a 
forecast in that circumstance didn ’t seem to be useful , and, in fact, it could have been more of an 
obstacle to clear communication than a help.  I do expect that we’ ll return to the quarterly —
regular quarterly cycle in June, however.  
In terms of the forecast, so , as I mentioned, you know , we see the U.S. economy starting 
out strong —from a strong position, different —different  as we—as we talk ed through it today .  
People have a rang e of perspectives on the way the year is going to go , but I think there ’s a 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 21  
 pretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter , with probably out —you know, 
output declining a bit.  After that, it becomes hard to say , you know , what ’ll happen in the third 
and fourth quarters and thereafter , and it’s going to depend, again , on—on the path of the virus.  
So the thing we do know is that we ’ll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit a nd 
there to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay.  Now we ’ll go to Bloomberg News.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Craig Torres at Bloomberg News.  You say the 
path of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus.  How importa nt is fiscal 
policy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short  and of high 
human consequence or little human consequence?  And , second, can you talk a little bit about 
what ’s on your dashboard for economic and financial indica tors that you’ re going to be watching 
day to day?  I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in 
April.  What are you going to be watching , and what should we be watching?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of fiscal policy, I thi nk in the first instance —and 
you’re—you’re  seeing some of this now —is the thing that fiscal policy and , really , only fiscal 
policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers , and we ’ve seen some 
of that.  So, that ’s—that’s  an imp ortant job for fiscal policy.  More broadly, after that , there ’s the 
question of —of fiscal —broader fiscal stimulus , and I think that ’ll depend on the path of the 
economy.  I—I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it’ s some —it’s very 
hard to predict.  But there could certainly be —there could certainly be , you know , a need for 
that.  And your second question was —what was your second question?  
CRAIG TORRES.  Ye s.  It was on what indicators you’ re going to be looking at, 
financial an d real.  
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 21  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think , in the very near term , we’re going to be looking at , you 
know , the Treasury market function.  We ’re really going to be looking to see that financial 
markets are returning to more liquid , more normal functioning.  That is  an essential part of our 
job.  That is —actually , you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to 
do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress , so we take that job very seriously.  It’s 
probably the most important thing we ’re doing now is that .  So we ’ll be watching that a nd we ’ll 
be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address —to—to support market 
functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.  Those are the 
things I ’ll be looking at.  You know, in terms of economic data, I think it ’s just so early.  You 
know, we ’re really looking —I mean , the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the 
virus.  You know, I think what happens —what happens  during the spread of the virus is probably 
not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months.  It ’s going to be —
because you may have a —you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things 
get better in the third quarter, that p robably won ’t matter so much.  We may be able to come 
back from that.  If it lasts longer —so that ’s really what I ’ll be looking for , is—is what is going to 
be the spread of the virus and what ’s the path it’ s going to take and what are the effects on the 
economy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to NBC News now. 
DAVID GURA.   Hi, Chair Powell.  This is David Gura from NBC News .  And a lot of 
good questions here , so I’ll—I’ll turn to one that ’s more philosophical in nature.  And you’ ve 
talked a bit about the —the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower 
economic activity for a period of time.   I’m reckoning with fact that my kid ’s going to be out of 
school until April 20 at the earliest, s o we ’re feeling this very , very acutely .  But I wonder if you 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 21  
 could just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader 
context —how you look at this a nd how anomalous this thing is with which you and your 
colleagues are going to have to reckon.  That ’s my first que stion. 
The second is , you know , we’ve seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few 
weeks , and the market —which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to —
has reacted negatively to some of that.  What do you make of that?  G oing back to the question 
that was asked earlier about the toolbox and—and  what ’s left —what’s left  in it, r ates are low.  
Does that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools 
therein?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess your fi rst question is , how —how  do we think about the 
time—the time  for this thing ?  You know —and the truth is , we just don’ t know , and, you know , 
the experts we talk to will say that they don ’t know , and that it ’s, in fact , unknowable.  It’s going 
to depend on a number of things.  First, it’ s the measures that we take to , you know , to—with the 
social distancing , and the —all the things businesses and school and everyone ’s doing  now .  And 
that will depend , to some extent , on how compliant people are.  You can see that some countries 
have had a —have been able to , through aggressive measures and really high compliance —have 
been able to bend the curve and—and  do that.  And whether we succeed  or—you know, that ’s 
really the question.  And I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’t , you know —I’ll resist the impulse to guess.  I 
really don ’t know what that will be.  
In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, 
plenty of power left in our tools , and I would point in particular to the  liquidity tools.  That , I 
think, is —is right now the most important thing that we ’re doing.  Our interest rates will 
matter —cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts , but they ’ll 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 21  
 matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover.  So —but in the forefront now are the 
liquidity tools and—and  getting that job done well.  
In addition, as I mentioned, we —you know , we have room to provide forward guidance, 
to do more asset purchases.  I think there —there  is room for us to do what we need to do.  I—I 
would just close , though,  by saying  that, you know , typically , fiscal policy does play a major role 
when —when  there are downturns.  You  saw—you’ve seen that in many past downturns , and 
that’s beyond just the automatic stabilizers.  Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary 
basis , and that —that  will probably need to be the case here as well.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to Politico.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida with Politic o.  Thanks for doing the call.  I just 
wanted to ask , do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council?  With 
all the stress that’ s showing up in different markets , do you see risks  to financial stability rising ?  
Do you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack  down on?  And are you 
confident that there aren ’t any nonbanks that are systemically important?  
CHAIR POWELL.  FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs.  And 
it’s a big group—it’ s got  a lot of people.  I think it serves a good purpose.  But, you know, you 
should know that we are , of course , in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies , 
constantly talking about what ’s going on in markets.  There’ s a lot of information and 
conve rsation on an ongoing basis there , I would say.  So —and the same is true with our central 
bank contacts around the world.  W e’re in ongoing contact with all the major central banks 
around the world, talking about what ’s going on.  We’re having group calls, we ’re calling one-
on-one, so there ’s quite a lot of information being exchanged there.  
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 21  
 And then, your question was , nonbank SIFIs.  You know , again, that ’s a judgment for 
the—that’s a judgment for the  FSOC.  I—you know , I’m comfortable with the actions th at we’ ve 
taken , and if—if we do identify , you know, a systemically important nonbank institution , then 
we wouldn’ t hesitate to designate it, but —although I guess now we ’re working more on 
activities , but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so — 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay — 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Financial stability risks —are those rising?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I’m sorry, the question was — 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Are risks to financial stability rising , given all the stress that ’s 
happening in financial m arkets?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  I would say , you know , that ’s—that’s  something that 
happens when markets are as volatile as they are, w hen you’ re having these big market 
movements while markets are trying to understand what ’s going on.  They ’re trying to reach a 
view on—in high uncertainty , and that ’s why you see lots and lots of volatility.  I think there ’s 
more risk to financial stability in an era like —like  that than there is when things are really placid , 
and, you know, we ’re going home at 4 o’ clock and kind of bored over here.  That ’s not the case 
right now.  So, financial stability —I would say those —those  risks do rise at a time of high 
volatility, particularly a time where we ’re presenting —presented with a challenge that is —is 
kind of unique , really —it’s not something we ’ve all done before.  
I also want to add, though, that, you know , we’re strongly focused on financial stability.  
We monitor it carefully.  We’ve built a very resilient financial system.  The banks are highly 
capitalized, lots o f liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their 
resilience to stress.   So our financial stability focus —our focus on an event like this over the last 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 21  
 10 years will pay dividends , in the sense that you have a much more resilient fi nancial system 
than you’ ve had before.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to Market News.  
JEAN YUNG.  Hi, this is Jean Yung.  I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market 
Desk expanded its term repo operations, but the take -up was a bit low.  Is that —did y ou have any 
takeaway from that?  Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had 
envisioned it , or was there something else that you learned from that?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw , that liquidity had 
become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets , and we decided to offer very large 
quantities of term and overnight repo to address that.  That makes it easier to finance the 
purchase of repos —sorry, of Treasuries and MBS.   So we did that , and as you pointed out, the 
take- up was not as high as many had expected , and I did—we did learn something from  that.  We 
thought that was worth doing , and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather 
than trying to intermed iate through the dealers.  
And so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for 
our portfolio, s o we did that on Friday.  We bought —the next day , Friday, we went in and we 
bought across the curve , and we bought, I think, $ 37 billion worth of securities , and then we saw 
what happened with that.  We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn ’t 
what we needed.  And that ’s why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this 
afternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures , with the  broad 
support of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity.  And I —I think you 
can see us working through different solutions and—and  finding the one that we think really will 
work and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it. 
March 15, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference Call   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 21  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’re going to go to Reuters for the last question. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Two 
things , if I could.  Could you describe any discussions you’ ve had in coordination with the major 
banks —this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers —how far can 
they draw it down?  How much do you think they can put out —out  to customer finance?  Did 
you get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something 
else?   And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of —of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to 
do some sort of direct lending facilit y? 
CHAIR POWELL.  We  have given broad general guidance to the banks.  We’d like them 
to use their buffers to provide —you know, to provide  loans and—and  also to work with their 
borrowers .  As you can see, we ’re providing a lot of guidance to them across a w ide range, a nd 
they’re saying they have every intention of doing that.  That ’s good to hear.  A nd—s o we ’ll see 
how that works out.  There —there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know , we hear the 
banks saying , that ’s exactly what they ’re going to  do, s o that ’s a good thing. 
You know , we’re—of course , we’ve —we’re—we ha ve nothing to announce on—on 
13(3)  powers , but, you know , of course , we—that ’s part of our playbook in —you know, in any 
situation like this.  So, as I said, we’re—we ’re prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate 
to—you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy , and, hence, to support the 
availability of credit to households and businesses. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
April 29 , 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  Thanks for joining us today.  I would like to begin 
by acknowledging the tragic loss and tremendous hardship that people are experiencing both 
here in the United  States and around the world.  The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a 
public health crisis, and the most important response is coming from those in the front lines in hospitals, emergency services, and care facilities.  On behalf of the Federal R eserve, let me 
express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselves at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation.  
The forceful measures that we as a country are taking to control the spread of the virus 
have brought much of the economy to an abrupt halt.  Many businesses have closed, people have been asked to stay home, and basic social interactions are greatly curtailed.  People are putting 
their lives and livelihoods on hold, at significant economic and persona l cost.  All of us are 
affected, but the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them.  It is worth 
remembering that the measures we are taking to contain the virus represent an investment in our 
individual and collective health.  As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good.  
While many standard economic statistics have yet to catch up with the reality we ’re 
experiencing, it ’s clear that the effects on the economy are sev ere.  Millions of workers are 
losing their jobs :  Next week’s jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate, 
which was at 50 -year lows just two months ago, has surged into double  digits.  Household 
spending has plummeted as people stay home, a nd measures of consumer sentiment have fallen 
precipitously.  Hotels, airlines, restaurants, department stores, and other retailers have been particularly hard hit.  Manufacturing output fell sharply in March and is likely to drop even more 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 24 
 rapidly this mo nth, as many factories have temporarily closed.  Overall, economic activity will 
likely drop at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter.  Inflation is also being held down, 
reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices.  
Both the  depth and the duration of the economic downturn are extraordinarily uncertain 
and will depend in large part on how quickly the virus is brought under control.  The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of gove rnment to cushion 
the blow and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes. 
The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  We are also committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  Last month we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero.  We stated then and again today that we expect to maintain 
interest rates at this level until we ’re confident that the economy has weathered recent events and 
is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals. 
Of course, lowering interest rates cannot stop the sharp drop in economic activity caused 
by closures and other forms of social distancing.  And low rates will not effectively spur the economy if those rates do not feed through to broader financial conditions or if households and businesses are unable to get credit.  
The economic disruptions caused by the virus created tremendous strains in some 
essential financial markets and have impaired the flow of credit in the economy.  Without access to credit, families can be forced to cut back on necessities and could los e their homes.  
Businesses can be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn.  Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating the 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 24 
 damage to the economy and setting the stage for t he recovery.  We have been taking broad and 
forceful actions to these ends.  
To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, foster smooth market 
functioning, and promote effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial 
conditions, we have been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed 
securities.  The markets for these securities play a critical role in the economy, and they came under great stress last month as the scale of economic disruption became clearer and as investors clamored for liquidity.  Our purchases have helped market conditions improve substantially in recent weeks.  In light of this improvement, we have slowed our pace of purchases.  We will continue our purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities as needed.  While the 
primary purpose of these securities purchases is to preserve smooth market functioning and effective policy transmission, the purchases will offer —will also foster more accommodative 
financial conditions.  
We are al so undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial system and to more 
directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments.  These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.  In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs can improve market functioning by increasing the willingness of private lenders to extend credit.  Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by the financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 24 
 forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we ’re confident that we are solidly on the road to 
recovery.  
I would stress that these are lending powers and not spending powers.  The Fed can not 
grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only make loans to solvent entities that the —
with the expectation that the loans will be repaid.  Many borrowers will benefit from our 
programs, as will the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resource s.  The Cares Act and other legislation provide direct help to 
people, businesses, and communities.  This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long- lasting damage to 
our economy. 
At the Fed, we ’re doing all we can to help American families and businesses weather this 
difficult period.  When the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work.  We will continue to use our tools to assure that the recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.  Thank you, and I ’ll be glad to take your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna Smialek.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  T hanks for taking our question s.  You guys 
have cut rate s to zero, you’ re buying up huge quantities of government debt —I guess the 
question is, what more can you realistically do to help the economy, and where do you see a need for Congress to step in?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that we’ re—we’re  commi tted to using our full range of 
tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  We’re going to use them, as I mentioned, 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 5 of 24 
 forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we ’re confident that we ’re solidly on the road to 
recovery a nd also to assure t hat that recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible.  As 
long as needed, we ’ll use them .  And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on 
which we can still provide support to the economy.  As you know, our credit policies are not 
subje ct to a specific dollar limit.  They can be expanded as appropriate , and we can do new ones.  
So we can continue to be part of the answer.  
Will there be a need to do more , though?  I think the answer to that— that will be “yes.”  I 
would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and 
other  laws—several other laws.  And that ’s appropriate.  With enhanced unemployment 
insurance and the P aycheck P rotection P rogram, we ’ve seen an extraordinary , historically large 
reaction.  But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the —if the  recovery is to be a robust one.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick Timiraos.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks, Chair Powell .  Nick Timiraos of the Wa ll Street Journal .  I 
want to follow up on Jeanna ’s question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials 
should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment?  And what policy tools did you discuss at your me eting today that might be used to stop a deflationary 
spiral?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me —let me start —I’ll take the questions in the order you —
you gave them.  So in terms of, if I can say , legislative priorities, we don ’t—we ’re not 
responsible for fiscal policy.  Those will be decisions for Congress to make .  But I would say that 
policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they’ re able to produce goods  and—and to either hold on to their 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 24 
 employees or quickly rehire them, those are going to be key policies.  They ’ll come with a hefty 
price tag, but we would come out of this event eventually with —with a stronger economy and 
with less long -run damage to the  economy.  So that ’s—that’s  a key thing that —that , really , 
Congress could do over time.  
In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have  our—our credit facilities are— are 
wide open.  We can do more on that front.  In addition, you know, we ’ve had—we’ve had 
extensive discussions, as I ’ve mentioned—done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy 
might look like over —in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy.  
We do think that our —our  policy stance today is right where it should be  for now.  As you know, 
we cut rates to the effective lower bound , we—and we ’ve said that we’ ll keep them there until 
we’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to 
achieve our goals.  With asset purchases, we’ re continuing to purchase Treasury securities and 
agency M BS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning.  So we ’re doing those 
things , and I would say that we ’ll continue to use our tools as needs be.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve Liesman.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, question—Steve Liesman with CNBC.  I ’ve got two 
questions here.  First of all, why aren ’t you announcing or conducting a specific quantitative 
easing program ?  And —and maybe you could explain what the context is now of the pur chases 
that will be m ade and the amounts that are to  come.  
The second question I have is, are —is the Federal Reserve really taking enough risk to 
help households and businesses here , in that you just said that the programs that are out there 
may be best fo r those who are able to repay loans.  B ut—so don’ t you have a series of programs 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 24 
 essentially lending only to those able to repay, which is essentially helping those who may need 
it the least?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, let me say  again, in terms of —of asset purchases and —and other 
measures, we —we do think our —our  policy stance is appropriate now.  We ’ve had discussions, 
as I’ve mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the 
future.  We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate.  We’re not going to change it now.  
And we ’re really waiting to see more from the economy.  There are a range of potential paths the 
economy could be on, and I think as—as the time approaches for —then we ’ll—you know, we ’ll 
address your first question, which is about asset purchases.  So —but that ’s not something we ’re 
doing today.  It’ s—it’s something that we have talked about , and, you know , for now, we like 
our current policy stance. 
In terms of risk, so , you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes .  And 
there are a number of aspects under section 13( 3), and you can see that they’ ve permitted us to, I 
think, move very quickly and move into areas where we ’ve never been before and do so quite 
aggressively.  So I —I think we ’re going places and providing help in places where we never 
have , and I’m glad that we are.  I think it ’s appropriate that we are.  
Nonetheless, these are lending powers .  And if you read sec tion 13( 3) of the Dodd-
Frank —or, the Federal Reserve Act , and I know you have , it does require that —that we be 
secured to our satisfaction , and—and we can ’t lend to insolvent companies.  You know, it ’s clear 
these are lending powers , and we are —we are ultimately bound to—to  implement the  laws that 
Congress gives us.  We —we  do not make grants .  We can ’t make grants.  And I —the reason I 
raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that.  
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 24 
 We—you know, we can do what we can do, and we will do it to the absolute limit of 
those powers.  We will —we’ll keep at it.  And you—I just want people to know that we’ll—we 
will be at it with —with  the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing.  We 
will keep using our autho rities .  But there are authorities that we don’ t have , and there may be a 
need for those authorities to be used as well as ours.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Heather Long. 
HEATHER LONG.  Hi.  Hi, Chair Powell, it’ s Heather Long from t he Washington Post .  
I have two questions for you, both on timing.  The first, do you plan to launch the C orporate 
Credit F acility  and the Main Street lending facilities  in May or early May ?  Anything you can 
give us —a sense on timing?  
And the second, in the statement , you ref erred today —the FOMC refers today to a lot of 
medium- term risks from the pandemic .  That sounds like you all think this is going to be a long 
recovery—a long road to recovery.  Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this 
recovery taking shape?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.   So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities 
are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon—fairly soon.  Main  Street 
facility  is—we’re close to announcing—to issuing a new term sheet.  As you know, we put out a 
term sheet for comment a while back , and we got a couple thousand comments.  We’ve carefully 
studied them.  We’ve tried to reflect those in what we ’re doing now.  I think, with Main Street, 
there ’ll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there.  It—this is a broad area 
of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs , so we ’re going to keep at that for 
some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products.  So I think we ’ll be at —we ’ll 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 24 
 probably be continuing to work and expand Main Street  for some time , but it won ’t be done quite 
as quickly.  But the first part of it, I think, will be done fairly quickly.  
In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we—I ’ll just read the sentence.  It 
says:  “ [The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, 
and inflation in the near  term and poses considerable risks  to the economic outlook over the 
medium term. ”  So the “ medium” —but what we meant by that, “ over the medium  term ”—so , 
obviously, what we ’re talking about is, you know, not right now , in the very near term.  It’ s 
between now and the long term , so the next year or so.  And I would point to a couple of —of 
risks to the outlook that—what  we were thinking of.  First is just the virus.   How long will it take 
to get it under control?  Will there be additional outbreaks?  Will there be drugs that can either 
treat it or— or a vaccine of some kind?  So there’s —all of that is very much shrouded in 
uncertainty.  
The second issue—and this is a very substantial one —is just the possibility of —of 
damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels.  The first is just 
workers who—if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can—can  lose the s kills 
that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career.  So that ’s a— that’s a  feature of deep and long recessions, and that ’s something we ’ve got 
to watch out for.  Another is just businesses—you know , these thousands of great medium - and 
small -sized businesses that we have all over the country .  They’re worth so much more to the 
economy than the sum of their net assets.  They contain—you know, they’ re job creators , they ’re 
really important.  And if we s ee an unnecessary —unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that 
could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time.  So the good news is that we 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 24 
 have policies, as I mentioned in my remarks —we have policies that can address those things, but 
not perfectly.  So that ’s—that’s  another risk.  
The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension.  This is a very global 
phenomenon, and you are —we ’re seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, 
very negative , and that, too, ca n weigh on U.S. economic performance over time.  I —you know, 
I would say, just on the U.S.—on the U.S. economy, there are things you can say, one can say.  
The first is that, in the near term, we ’re going to see, you know, significant declines in economic 
activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment.  We ’re going to see 
that as a consequence of the virus and the measures we’ re taking to protect ourselves from it. 
The next phases are more uncertain, highly uncertain, but we wil l go through a phase 
starting fairly soon where we begin to reopen the economy.  And probably the economic activity 
will pick  up as consumer spending picks up.  Consumer spending, as I mentioned, has gone 
down quite a lot.  It’ll begin to pick up as people  start to return to their normal patterns of 
spending.  But the chances are that it won ’t go right back to where we were , because people 
will—until the y’re confident of —that the virus is well and truly under control, then they will be 
somewhat probably rel uctant to —to undertake certain kinds of activity.  So it may take some 
time for us to get back— it probably will take some time for us to get back  to—you know, to a 
more normal level of unemployment and—and, ultimately , to maximum employment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, James Politi.  
JAMES POLITI.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  You  didn’ t firm up your guidance on—this is 
James Politi from the Financial Times —you didn ’t firm up your guidance on interest rates at this 
meeting .  And given the risks that you j ust outlined, under what circumstances would you 
strengthen the F ed’s commitment to keep rates at the lower bound?  And is there any danger to 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 24 
 delaying—delaying that plan?  Then , on the credit facilities, what kind of demand are you 
expecting for the progr ams that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to 
rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Okay .  So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very 
quickly, very aggressively.  We were the first to return to  the effective lower bound, where we 
are now.  We got there essentially right away, and we think that ’s the right place to be.  We 
think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to— to be there 
for a good while , and that ’s appropriate.  So , you know, it ’s not as though the market is pricing 
in a near -term liftoff or anything like that.  And let me just say, we ’re going to not be in any 
hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off.  We ’re going to wait until we ’re—we’re  quite 
confident that the economy is —is well on the road to recovery.  So we don’ t see—we see our 
current stance and our current guidance —and I would say the same thing about asset 
purchases— we see them as appropriate.   I’ve—I’ve  also mentioned now a couple  times that we 
have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and 
that would, you know, depend on—on where we are in —in a range of potential economic 
scenarios.  So we —we  were thinking about that all the time , but right now, for now, we think our 
current stance is appropriate.  So  we made no change in it today. 
Second question was , how —so the thing about our facilities is , Treasury still has plenty 
of equity.  S o we ’ve said that  if—if demand for our facilities is greater than we ’ve estimated, 
then we ’ll expand them.  And we have the ability to do that.  So it won’ t be the way the —the  
Paycheck Protection Program  is, where there ’s a specific amount allocated —appropriated for it, 
and—and then there ’s no more money.  That ’s—that  will be unlikely to happen here unless we 
exhaust T reasury ’s equity, and we ’re a long way from doing that.  
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 24 
 The second thing I would say is —and you’ ve all seen this—is when we announce these 
facilities —and I mentioned this in my remarks —it’ s not  just the actual lending we do, it’s the —
we build confidence in the market.  And private market participants come in .  And many 
companies that would’ ve had to come to the F ed have now been able to finance themselves 
privately since we announced the —the initial term sheet on —on these facilities.  So that ’s a good 
thing.  Companies are out there financing, they ’re out there raising liquidity.  We haven ’t made 
any corporate loans to—in those facilities .  We’ve made the short -term money  market loans , 
but—we haven’ t made any of them.  And yet there ’s a tremendous amount of financing going 
on, and that ’s a good thing. 
So we —for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, 
because there is this announcement effect that reall y gets the market functioning again.  Of 
course, we have to follow through, though.  And we will follow through to validate that —that  
announcement effect . 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Howard Schneider.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Oh, hi, Chair Powell, and thanks for doing this.   I wanted to 
get your —a little more expansion on the timing of recovery and the —the  connection between the 
health response.  You said earlier, I think, that you thought the second half of the year could see 
a pretty robust rebound.  Is that now out  of the question?  And do you think a steady recovery is 
really possible until a vaccine ’s developed, given the patchwork of measures we ’ve seen taken 
around the states?  Is that going to really lead us to a steady path out , absent a vaccine? 
CHAIR POWELL.   You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain.  
Today they’ re unusually uncertain, and that ’s—that’s  really because so much of the performance 
of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 24 
 control it, o ur success in reopenin g the economy,  and also the time it takes to develop new drugs.  
And our tools, the thi ngs that we do, don’t affect any of those things.  We ’re not experts on those 
things either , but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain.  So this is an 
unusual , new kind of uncertainty added on top of our —our  regular uncertainty . 
But I —I will say, there —I think there are a few things that you can say about —about  the 
path ahead.  First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, 
high unemployment .  Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business 
investment as well .  Unemployment moved up.  We ’re going to see economic data for the second 
quarter that’ s worse than any data we ’ve seen for the economy.  And they’ re a direct 
consequence of the disease and the measures that we’ re taking to protect ourselves from it.  
So then we will enter this new phase, and we —we ’re just beginning to maybe do that, 
where we will —formal measures that require social distancing will be rolle d back gradually a nd 
at different paces in different parts of t he country.  And, in time, this —during this period, the 
economy will begin to recover.  People will come out of their homes, start to spend again.  W e’ll 
see unemployment go down, we ’ll see economic activity pick up.  And, you know, when will 
that be?  It ’s very hard to say.  But let ’s just say, for this purpose, that it ’s in the third quarter.  
So, as I mentioned earlier, that —that  could be a fairly, you know, a large increase.  Given the —
given the  size of the fall, the increase could also b e substantially  large, although it’ s unlikely that 
it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre -crisis levels.  Of course, this is the 
period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to 
avoid.  
I think then, after  that period, at some point you will have —you  know, the kind of formal 
social -distancing measures will —will  be gone, but you’ ll still be left with, probably, a level of 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 24 
 caution on the part of people who will —who will  worry and probably keep worrying for some —
for some  time.  You would think that behavior will change as  people gain confidence .  So the —
the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and 
regain their economic activity.  I think trying to be really precise  about when that might happen 
and what the numbers might look like is —I think  it’s very tough to do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Steve Matthews.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  Chairman Powell, you’ ve 
noted a number of times over the last year that there ’s been a broadening out of job gains with 
marginalized workers, people who have been left out of the recovery over the 10- year period, 
finally making job gains , and—particularly minorities, but also many other workers.  Do you 
worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on those workers who’ ve struggled and just got 
job gains in the last year or two, and that it may take years from now before there are 
opportunities for them again?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  That ’s exactly what I worry ab out.  So unemployment has 
tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.  And it tends to come down—come down faster as well, but it tends to go up faster and be much, much higher.  And w e were in a place—only two months ago, we were 
well into —beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were , and every reason to 
think that it was ongoing.  We were hearing from minority —low - and moderate -income and 
minority communities that this was the best labor market they ’d seen in their lifetime.  All the 
data supported that as well.  And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now.  All the more need for our urgent response —and also that of Congress, which has been urgent an d 
large —and to do what we can to avoid longer -run damage to the economy,  which is what I —I 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 24 
 mentioned earlier.  This is an exogenous event that —you know, just, it happened to us.  It wasn ’t 
because there was something wrong with the economy.  And I think it  is important that we do 
everyth ing we can to avoid that longer -run damage and try to get back to where we were , 
because I do very much have that concern.  I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those 
who are least able to —to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing 
their incomes and have little cushion to—you know, to protect them in times like that.  So, yes, 
that’s a very big concern. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico.   The Paycheck Protection 
Program  has experienced some logistical problems because of the speed at which all of this is 
happening.  For the Main Street lending facilities , which will also work through banks, what 
lessons are you taking away from that?  And then, more broadly, you know, you mentioned 
earlier this year that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path.  And I was just wondering, 
for Republicans that are starting to get worried about how much fiscal spending they ’re having to 
do in this crisis , you know, whether that should be a concern for them .  
CHAIR POWELL.  So a couple things.  This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck 
Protection Program, in two ways.  One is , these are not grants, these are loans.  So I don’ t know 
that the demand will be quite as strong as —as it has been for the PPP.  I don’ t know that.  And 
the second thing is, we won’ t run out of money.  You know, it ’s not a limited pot , so there won’ t 
be this incentive to try to get there first and that sort of thing.  So I ’m—I’m  hopeful we —we  will 
very much try to learn as much as possible from that facility and from all the other ones , too.  We 
have a lot to learn here, so we ’ll certainly be trying to do that.  
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 24 
 In terms of fiscal concern , so  I—you know, I ’m—for many years, I ’ve been, before the 
Fed, I have longtime been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a 
sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the federal level.  We have not been on such a path 
for some time , which means —just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy.  This 
is not the time to act on those concerns.  This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to —to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as 
little damage to the longer -run productive capacity of the economy as possible.  
The time will come again —and reasonably soon, I think—where we can —where we can  
think about a long- term way to get our fiscal house in order.  And we absolutely need to do that.  
But this is not the time to be —in my personal view, this is not the time to —to let that concern, 
which is a very serious concern, but —to let that get in the way of us winning this battle , really.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Oh, yes.  T hank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from 
Fox Business Network.  Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine , from clearing that uncertainty 
you talked about around treatment and whatnot , for the Federal Reser ve pulling back on some of 
the F ed’s actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound?   Also, when does that Main 
Street lending facility get deploye d?  Because you  talked about “soon” —you know, some  
businesses are in need now.   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so we don’ t—we’re not in a position to make, you know, 
a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready, a nd so we’re not 
going to set our policies based on—on  our estimate of that.  We’re going to just provide the 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 24 
 support that we can with the tools that we have, and we ’re going to keep doing that until —until  
the recovery ’s well under  way.  
In terms of Main Street, so you know the story.  We put out a term sheet , we got a lot of 
comments, we took those very much to heart.  We ’ve spent a great deal of time here.  It ’s a 
challenging space , because it ’s many different kinds of borrowers —they have different needs, 
differ ent sizes of companies.  A nd so, we’re —as I mentioned, we ’re very close to announcing a 
new term sheet , which will then become operative fairly quickly.  My guess is, though, that we ’ll 
keep —we’ll keep  looking to add products and add different kinds of bor rowers to that as we go.  
And we ’re—we’re well aware of the importance of —of doing it as quickly as possible.  We, 
here, you know, we ’re very much in touch with —with  the urgency of that need.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Don Lee. 
DON LEE.  Chair Powell, it ’s Don  Lee from the  L.A. Time s.  I just wanted to follow up 
on a question —the question on the labor market.  I know you said that it ’s highly uncertain but, 
you know, there are analysts who think that we ’ll have very high unemployment until even the 
end of next year, as high as 9 percent.  And , at this point, what —can you just talk a little bit more 
about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So unemployment ’s going to go up to a high number in the 
second quarter —uncertain what the number will be.  When —and that ’s because so much 
economic activity has been shuttered , really , as we take social -distancing measures.  And the —
so sometime fairly soo n here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of 
the country, we ’ll see the social -distancing measures rolled back.  People will begin to spend 
more money.  It’ s, really , consumer spending has fallen precipitously.  And once that  starts to 
happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down.  I don’ t think it ’ll get 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 24 
 anywhere near the historically low levels that we had in —as recently as February, 3½ percent.  I 
think it will take some time for that to happen, for  us to get back to anything that resembles 
maximum employment. 
But, I mean, the main thing we want is , we want to get back on that road.  We want to get 
that—that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can.  Not faster than we can, 
but as  fast as we can.  The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy’ s healing, 
where we have the disease under control, where we don ’t, you know, take too much risk of —of 
second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work.  And, you know, 
it’s—again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will—we will  be there with our tools , 
supporting the economy and supporting that recovery.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Scott Horsley.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  After the financial cri sis, banks were 
instructed to up their capital so they could weather an economic shock.  What kind of steps 
do you think we need to take for the economy writ large to make it more resilient to this kind 
of shock?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Can you just say that part —you’re a little bit low volume . 
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Yes.  What kind of steps could we take to help the economy as a 
whole be more resilient to this kind of exogenous shock?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it ’s an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike 
anything, certainly , that ’s happened in my lifetime.  And a couple things come to mind.  I —I 
think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions.  It’s early to 
be asking them.  We’re still putting out the fire.  We’re still trying to win.   And I think we ’ll be 
at that for a while.  
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 19 of 24 
 You know, but  I’d point to a couple of directions.  You know, we worked hard to 
strengthen the banks :  much higher levels of capital , liquidity, far greater sense of what the risks 
are they ’re running and how  to manage them.  So the breakdowns that we ’ve seen in market 
function have really been in the capital markets.  And I don’ t—I wouldn’ t rush in with prudential 
regulation into the capital markets .  But I think —and we did plenty of things —you know, 
triparty —you know, we did a lot of reform in the capital markets :  money market reform, triparty 
repo reform, central clearing, all these important things.  But there —there  will no doubt be —
with this —the size and force of this shock will no doubt  reveal weaknesses in the financial 
architecture , and we ’ll have to go to work on those. 
I—I also think  it—you know, it tells you the importance of —of getting your fiscal house 
in order.  The U.S. really hadn’ t—really hadn’t  gotten back to where we needed to get on fiscal 
policy.  And, you know, so we —we  had an already high level of debt to GDP , and rising 
quickly, when th is shock arrived.  Now, we have the fiscal capacity to deal with it, I believe.  But 
we will need to —idea lly, you would go into an unexpected shock like this with a —with a  much 
stronger fiscal—fiscal  posture.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the 
drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we mi ght see any kind of deflation, even for a very short 
period, that would require a Fed response?   If we g et a negative print on CPI or PCE, how should 
people think about that?  
And second question— there is a disconnect, it appears, between the markets and th e 
economic outlook right now.  And I know you said that this isn’ t the time to worry about moral 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 24 
 hazard, but do you worry, with the size of stimulus that you and the Congress are putting into the 
economy, there could be financial stability problems as this  goes along?  
CHAIR POWELL.  In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and 
strongly related to inflation expectations.  And during the G lobal F inancial C risis, there was a 
concern that we might see deflation, but it didn’ t happen.  Inflation  expect —inflation  tended to 
move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak.  And —but inflation expectations did 
not move strongly down here in the United States.  They have in other places in the world, 
though, over the past 25 years.  The re’s been downward pressure on inflation, really , for several 
decades now.  
So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn’ t see 
deflation.  And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflatio n over 
time.  So we ’ll be there to work on that.  I think you asked, really , about headline inflation.  If —
if low energy prices—very low energy prices were to —were to  drop headline inflation negative, 
I—I would hope that people would see through that —and w e’ll be monitoring it  very carefully —
would see through it , though, and look to core , which is a better predictor of future inflation.  So, 
needless to say, we’ ll be keeping very close track of that.  
In terms of the markets, you know, our —our  concern is that they be working.  We ’re 
not—we ’re not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it ’s just —markets are trying to 
price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable , which is the path of this virus 
globally and its effect on the economy.  And that ’s very, very hard to do.  That’s why you see 
volatility the way it’ s been, market  reacting to —to things with a lot of volatility.  But, you know, 
what we ’re trying to assure , really , is that the market is working.  The market is assessing risks, 
lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events.  
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 24 
 That’s—that is really important for everybody, including— including, you know, the —the  most 
vulnerable among us , because if —if markets stop working  and credit stops flowing, then you 
see—that ’s when you see, you know, very sharp negative —even more negative economic 
outcomes. 
So I think our measures have —have  supported market function pretty well.  You know, 
we’re going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that.  But I think it’ s been good to see 
markets working again .  Particularly , the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing, 
as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers  and households have been able to 
be home —you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they ’re 
not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and ’0 9. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Chris from the AP.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Chris Rugaber over at AP, thank you.  I 
guess I had two questions.  I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little 
bit how you see —how you see  things going from here.  You did talk about potential loss of skills 
over time.  So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep 
unemployment high and, therefore, potenti ally beyond the ability of the F ed to do anything 
about, which is  something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession , and then 
eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought ? 
Second ques tion is just on the money from T reasury, the $454 billion.  I t sounds like you 
want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street 
program.  Are you willing to use that to backstop, say, a program that is having more losses?  I mean, you know, what ’s your tolerance for loss among that $ 454 billion?  Thank you. 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 24 
 CHAIR POWELL.  So, in terms of the labor market, the —the risk to—of damage to 
people ’s skills and their careers and their lives is a function of time to some extent.  So the longer 
one is unemployed, the harder it gets, I think— and we ’ve probably all seen this in our lives —the 
harder it is to get back into the workforce and get back to where you were, if you ever do get 
back to where you were.  So, you know, longer and deeper downturns have had—have left more of a mark, generally, in that dimension with the labor force.  And so that ’s why —as I mentioned, 
that’s why the urgency in doing wha t we can to prevent that longer -run damage.  It doesn’ t have 
to be that way.  We won ’t be able to limit all of it , but we do have the tools to—to  do what we 
can to —to keep people in touch wi th the labor force and working a nd also out of insolvency, too.  
It doesn ’t seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over 
this.  So, nonetheless, there will be some of that.  But we do have some tools to ameliorate tha t. 
In terms of the —so in terms of the —the  money, you know , the $454 billion, it ’s a couple 
things.  First, the Treasury Secretary  really has—has  authority over that, right?  And it stands in 
front of our losses.  So, you know —but I do think we are —we ’re clearly moving into areas 
where there is more risk than there has been in the past.  And that ’s okay.  I think that ’s what 
we’re supposed to do.  This is —this is  a very unusual time.  And so—but in terms of the —of the  
way to think about that money, I think that ’s really a question for the Treasury D epartment.  You 
know, we are —we set up the facilities, and we work very, very closely and successfull y and 
collaboratively with the T reasury on this, but that —that  particula r aspect of it falls more to the 
Secretary . 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer for the last question.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, I ’m wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 24 
 maybe going into investments maybe in the stock market that aren ’t so great for them.  And also, 
I’m wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we ’re going to 
have interest rates near zero .  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a 
number of channels in a positive way.  Lower interest rates support economic activity through 
channels that we —overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well.  T hey make it 
cheaper to borrow, they make —they drive , you know, your cost s of borrowing down.  They 
do—they do  raise asset prices, including the value of your home.  If your saver owns a home or 
has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that.  But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is —you know, that ’s—that’s —you’ re not going to 
benefit from low interest rates.  
But we —you know, we have to look out for the overall economy.  Low interest rates 
suppor t employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates.  And I think 
for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing.  And that’s  not to say 
they’ re good for every single person, but that shouldn’ t stop us from doing what we think is —is 
good for the whole. 
In terms of how low , I really don ’t want to speculate .  You know, we will turn to 
questions like that soon enough.  B ut the —in terms of how long we ’ll stay and under what 
conditions we ’ll stay at the effective lo wer bound, those are just exactly the things we ’re 
thinking about. 
Right now we like the place we are.  We’ve said that we’ ll keep our rates where they are 
until we ’re confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track 
to achieve our —our  goals.  So that ’s where we are.  We ’re leaving—we’re not changing that 
April 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 24 of 24 
 guidance today , you know , but it ’ll be—that means we’ re going to be very patient.  That means 
we’re—we’re  not going to be in any hurry to move rates up.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
June  10, 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone , and thanks for joining us.  Our country 
continues to face a difficult and challenging time, as the pandemic is causing tremendous 
hardship here in the United States and around the world.  People have lost loved ones.  Many millions have lost their jobs.  There is great uncertainty about the future.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to using our tools to do whatever we can—and for as long as it takes— to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as 
possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  
The most important response to this crisis has come from our health -care workers.  And 
on behalf of the Federal Reserve, let me express our sincere gratitude to those dedicated individuals who put themselve s at risk, day after day, in service to others and to our nation.  Let 
me also thank the many other essential workers across the country who have helped meet our basic needs for goods and services in these difficult times.  
The virus and the forceful measur es taken to control its spread have induced a sharp 
decline in economic activity and a surge in job losses.  Indicators of spending and production plummeted in April, and the decline in real GDP in the current quarter is likely to be the most severe on record.  Even after the unexpectedly positive M ay employment report, nearly 
20 million jobs have been lost on net since February, and the unemployment rate has risen about 
10 percentage points, to 13.3 percent.  As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Stati stics, this 
figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points.  The downt urn has not fallen equally on all 
Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the most affected.  In 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 30 
 particular, the rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers, for women, 
and for African Americans and Hispan ics. 
In recent weeks, some indicators suggest a stabilization or even a modest rebound in 
some segments of the economy, such as retail merchandise and motor vehicle sales.  
Employment rose in many sectors of the economy in May, and the unemployment [rate] edged down as some workers returned to their jobs from temporary layoffs.  With the easing of social -
distancing restrictions across the country, people are increasingly moving about, and many businesses are resuming operations to varying degrees.  At the s ame time, many households have 
been receiving stimulus payments and unemployment benefits, which are supporting incomes and spending.  Activity in many parts of the economy has yet to pick up, however, and overall output is far below earlier levels.  Moreo ver, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs 
report, unemployment remains historically high.  
Weak demand, especially in sectors most affected by the pandemic, is holding down 
consumer prices.  As a result, inflation has fallen well below our symmetri c 2 percent objective.  
Indicators of longer -term inflation expectations have been fairly steady.  
The extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily uncertain and 
will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus.  We  all want to get back to 
normal, but a full recovery is unlikely to occur until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.  The severity of the downturn will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery when the public health crisis passes.  
The Fed’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and 
stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 30 
 the financial system.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy 
in this challenging time.  In March, we quickly lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, where we expect to keep it until we are confident th at the economy has weathered recent events 
and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment  and price -stability  goals.  
We have also been taking broad and forceful actions to support the flow of credit in the 
economy.  Without access to credit, families co uld be forced to cut back on necessities or even 
lose their homes.  Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further losses of jobs and incomes and worsening the downturn.  Preserving the flow of credit is thus essential for mitigating  the damage to the economy and setting the stage for the recovery.  
Since March, we have been purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury  and agency 
mortgage -backed securities in order to support the smooth functioning of these markets, which 
are vital to the  flow of credit in the economy.  Our ongoing purchases have helped to restore 
orderly market conditions and have fostered more accommodative financial conditions.  As 
market functioning has improved since the strains experienced in March, we have gradually 
reduced the pace of these purchases.  To sustain smooth market functioning and thereby foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, we will increase our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities ov er coming months at least at 
the current pace.  We will closely monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate to support our goals.  
The Federal Reserve is also undertaking programs to provide stability to the financial 
system and  to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy— for households, for 
businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments.  These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not otherwise available.  In addition, by s erving as a 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 30 
 backstop to key credit markets, the programs can increase the willingness of private lenders to 
extend credit.  Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as  these— those  we find ourselves in today.  We are 
deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and from the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and a ggressively until we ’re confident that we are solidly on the 
road to recovery.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox.  
I would stress that these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The  Fed cannot grant 
money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad- based 
eligibility to make loans to solvent entity —entities  with the expectation that the loans will be 
repaid.  Many borrowers will benefit from thes e programs, as will the overall economy.  But for 
many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, 
direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to 
make decisio ns about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The 
CARES Act and other legislation provide direct help to people and businesses and communities.  This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and  businesses in a 
time of need, but also in limiting long -lasting damage to our economy.  
At this meeting, my colleagues and I continued our discussion of approaches for 
conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its lower bound.  The measu res we 
discussed included explicit forms of forward guidance and asset purchases.  We used these tools 
in the aftermath of the G lobal F inancial C risis, and they have become a standard part of our 
toolkit.  We also reviewed the historical and foreign experi ence with targeting interest rates 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 30 
 along the yield curve.  Whether such an approach would usefully complement our main tools 
remains an open question.  We will continue our discussions in upcoming meetings and will 
evaluate our monetary policy stance and c ommunications as more information about the 
trajectory of the economy becomes available.  
We also resumed our regular quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or the SEP.  
The SEP is an input into our deliberations, not an outcome, and it does not represe nt a 
Committee view.  Rather, FOMC participants write down their individual views of the most 
likely path for the economy, conditioned  on each participant’s view of appropriate monetary 
policy.  We tabulate those submissions , and we publish them as the SEP .  Given the unusually 
high level of uncertainty about the outlook, many participants noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy, and that it ’s not possible to identify with confidence a 
single path as the “most likely”  one.  N onetheless, we believe that regular publication of the SEP 
provides a useful perspective on the way FOMC participants are assessing the path ahead.  
What the June SEP shows is a general expectation of an economic recovery beginning in 
the second half of thi s year and lasting over the next couple of years, supported by interest rates 
that remain at their current level, near zero.  Of course, my colleagues and I will continue to base our policy decisions on the full range of plausible outcomes and not on a par ticular forecast.  The 
risk-management approach—t his risk -management approach is the best way we can promote our 
maximum -employment  and price -stability  goals in these unusually uncertain circumstances.  
Finally, I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the 
pain of racial injustice in this country.   The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation.   We operate 
in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themsel ves on issues of racial equality.   I speak for my colleagues 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 30 
 throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say that there is no place at the Federal Reserve 
for racism and there should be no place for it in our society.  Everyone deserves the opportunity 
to participate fully in our society and in our economy.  
These principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diversity 
and inclusion in our workplace and to our work to ensure fair access to credit across the country.  We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles.   We 
understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to us ing our 
full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  
Thank you.  I look forward to our questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   For the first question, Nick Timiraos.  
NICK TIMI RAOS.   Yes, hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.   Nick Timiraos at t he Wall Street 
Journal .  I want to ask about the economic projections, and I realize these are more of an 
educated guess at this point, but they suggest the  Committee sees quite a large output gap o ver 
the next two years.  And yet the  Committee did not take any steps to date to—to reinforce your 
forward guidance.  And so my questions are , first, what are you hoping to learn by waiting?  
Second, how might that change your response?   And, third, how cl ose is the Committee to 
reaching a decision on a —a more concrete forward guidance and whether yield caps might 
reinforce that guidance?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is 
currently well positioned to support t he economy in this challenging time.  If we didn’ t think 
that, of course, we would change our policy now.  As you know, we —we lowered our policy rate 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 30 
 very quickly, [more] quickly than others, to the effective lower bound.  And we ’ve said that 
we’ll keep it  there until the economy has weathered the effects of the virus and is on track to 
achieve our goals.   You can see that in —in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that 
overwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at 
least through 2022.  And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et  cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the 
effective lower bound. 
So the first thing is, monetar y policy is in a good place , and it ’s—that ’s well understood 
in the markets.   Secondly, we ’ve also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the 
economy, as I mentioned.  And , third, we ’re continuing asset prices in coming months at —at a —
at a relatively high level.
1  So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place.  
So as we look ahead, we see that the path for the —ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and 
continues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic.  
So, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we —we looked in some depth at 
forward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those.   We also received a briefing 
on the historical experience with yield curve control.  And  we’ll continue those discussions in 
upcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion —more —
more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.   I—I would just say, in 
terms of —of what we ’re looking for, we —we expect to get a better understanding of the 
economy’ s trajectory  and, particularly , how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those 
goals.  So that ’s really what we ’re looking to achieve , and, as you can see, we ’re—we ’re actively 
at work on that.  
                                                 
1 Chair Powell intended to say “asset purchases” rather than “asset prices.”

 MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay.  Next, Jeanna . 
JEANNA SMIALEK.   Hi, Chair Powell.   Thank you so much for taking our question s.  
I’m—I’m curious about your inflation forecast s, which are —are pretty low across the forecast 
horizon.  I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy 
appropriate now , and why not just kind of throw everything you can—you know, everything and 
the kitchen sink at it currently?   And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency 
you see in —in returning it back to that 2  percent  target.  
CHAIR POWELL.   Our current policy stance is appropriate.  And remember, we ’re 
using—we ’re using our —our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent.  We 
have asset purchases, and we ’ve now said that we won’ t go any lower than this , and—but —but  
that we ’re prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound.   So we 
have all of our tools in— in use in a strong way.  And so what we ’re—what we ’re waiting for is 
to—is to learn more.   I—I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it ’s a pretty 
good—probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember.  It ’s a pretty good 
illustration of just how uncertain these times are.   The economy is reopeni ng.  We’re going to 
learn a whole lot about the —the path of the economy in the next —in coming months .  So that ’s 
really what we’ re—what we ’re looking for. 
In terms of inflation, you ’ll know that we —we had a 128- month expansion , and we never 
did quite get inflation back to 2 percent  on a symmetric, sustained basis.  We got close for the 
last couple of years, but we never did quite get there.  So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is —is going to be above most 
estimates of the natural rate for —certainly above the median in our —in our —in our SEP well 
through the end of —past the end of 2022.  So I do—I think we ’re in the right place now .  We—
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 30 
 we are looking carefully a t what the —as we learn more and —and better understand the —the 
path of the economy, we will be assessing, what ’s the best way to deploy all of our tools to 
achieve our goals in the best possible way ? 
And I ’ll—I’ll just say again that we are —the —the May empl oyment report, of course, 
was a—was a welcome surprise, very pleased.   We hope we get many more like it .  But I think 
we have to be honest .  It’s a—it ’s a long road.  I t’s—it’ s, depending on how you count it, well 
more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market .  It’s going to take some time .  And 
we are going to be deploying our tools —all of our tools , to their full extent, in pursuit of that —of 
those goals, however long it takes.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay.  Steve Liesman.  
STEVE LIESMAN.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I understand how the  Fed might 
react in the event things come out worse than expected.   I think I don’ t understand how you 
might react if things come out better than expected —kind of a variant on these other questions.  
How firm is the commitment to lower interest rates?   And if things end up better, do you stick 
with these low interest rates, as you —as you projected them?   And —or is it specific points that  
you have in mind— for example, unemployment or inflation —that is animating where you might  
go?  And what are those numbers that you’ re looking for that might cause you to change about 
the policy as it now is projected? 
CHAIR POWELL.   I would start with —tha t’s where I would start.  I would say, you 
know, we were —we just had a period of unemployment, as you know, that was in the —well 
below 4 percent , hanging around 3½  percent , that lasted two years.   And during that period of 
time, we  saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we ’d love to get 
back to.  We didn’ t see any problems with price inflation.  P rice inflation didn’ t really  react 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 30 
 much.  So, I would say, you know, we ’d be looking to get inflation back up, and we —we ’d be 
prepared to tolerate pretty low —welcome, in fact, not tolerate but welcome very low readings 
on—on unemployment just based on what we —what we saw in the last —in the last expansion.  
So, you know , we’re—we ’re not thinking about raising rates.   We’re not even t hinking 
about thinking about raising rates.  So what we ’re thinking about is —is providing support for 
this economy.  We do think this is going to take some time.  I think most forecasters believe that.   
It would be great if —if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that .  Not—
notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are —there are just a lot of people that are 
unemployed .  And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of —
even —even after a lot of strong job growth, that ’ll still be struggling to find jobs, and we ’ll still 
be providing strong accommodation for that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay, t hank you.  James.  
JAMES POLITI.   Thanks very much, Chair Powell.  There have been plenty of 
comparisons with the Great Dep ression of the 1930s since the crisis began.   I mean , is that 
scenario sort of got [ten] more dire as data comes out and we ’re looking at a more traditional and 
sudden recession?   And are you at all concerned that the performance —the strong performance 
in the stock market in the last few weeks is disconnected from economic reality? 
CHAIR POWELL.   I don’t think that the —that the Great Depression is a good example 
or a likely outcome or a model for what ’s happening here at all .  I really don ’t.  And there —ther e 
are just so many fundamental differences.   First, the government response has been so fast and so 
forceful .  The origin was quite different.   This was a very —an economy that was in a healthy 
place.   Of course, every economy has longer -run challenges, not —and that —that includes our 
economy, notwithstanding that 50 -year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 30 
 history and every reason to think it could continue.  So that ’s different from what was happening 
around the time of the Great —the Dep ression started.   The financial system this time was in —
was in —was in very good shape, much better capitalized.  So, you know, it ’s just not the right 
model. 
I would say,  we’re learning .  You know, every month that passes, we ’re seeing more, 
we’re learning  more.   And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in 
learning what the —what the real story will be, because we’ ll see the— the significant incoming 
data about the opening of the economy—the reopening of the economy.  You know —and I  
would say, assuming that the —that the —that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under 
control, I think that what you see is a —is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then 
an—an expansion that builds momentum over time.  
People will adju st, probably a little bit gradually , to some of the activities that would —
that involve getting together in small —in large groups in close quarters .  Those will be the 
harder parts of the economy to recover .  But, ultimately , we do see a full recovery over time.  
And that ’s really what , you know, what I think I ’m—I’m personally seeing.  And you could see 
significant job growth in —in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you’ re still going 
to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work.  A nd 
for—and that ’s what you see in —in—in, really , many, many forecasts at this point.   That doesn’ t 
mean it ’s right, but that’ s sort of a —a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Chris from the Associated Press.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.   Hi.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Well, in the 
projections you have —you didn’ t change the —the Fed policymakers didn’ t change their —the 
forecast for long- run unemployment, so that suggests that you —you know, the —that all of you 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 30 
 so far don’ t see necessarily prospects for long -term damage.  But still, what kind of data are you 
looking at here to gauge , you know, the potential for longer -term hits to the economy even as we 
have some of these—even as we have something like the May jobs report , you could still ha ve, 
at the same time, people return from temporary layoff s, there could still be permanent job losses?   
So what kind of data are you looking at to gauge that potential impact , and what is —what is it 
telling us so far?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Chris, t his is a really important risk.  And I think it ’s—it’ s not the 
risk for the next few months, but it ’s the risk over time of —of lasting damage to the —to these —
you know, to the productive capacity of the United States , typically in two forms .  One, through 
extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force .  They get out of 
touch with the skills and —that they need, and— and they hav e a hard time getting back in, and 
that drive s that—that , you know, it ’s very damaging to people ’s lives and their working lives .  
And it also just lowers , in a way —it can —it can increase the —you know, the unemployment 
rate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to 
have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the —in the labor force 
working. 
The other piece of it is just businesses.   You know, a shock like this that just comes in, 
it’s like a natural disaster.   You wouldn’ t want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the 
smaller and medium -sized  businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to—
you know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that —like this where , really, 
there was no reason for it.  Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out .  They’re 
going to fail all the time, and that ’s a healthy thing in capitalism .  That’s something that has to 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 30 
 happen.  B ut this is different .  This is a way—potentially —so those are the things we ’ve been 
worried about. 
We didn’ t change .  You—you’ re right, though.  We didn’ t change our longer -run 
estimate of —of potential growth or of the unemployment rate .  And that ’s—I would say, in my 
thinking, the reason I didn’ t change mine is that I still— I—I think we can avoid that or avoid 
much of that, most of that even.  A nd—and we do that with measures that —that , you know, keep 
people in their homes ; that—that support hiring ; that support growth;  that avoid unnecessary , 
avoidable business insolvencies.  A nd that ’s all the things that we ’re trying to do.   Basically, if 
you look at what ’s happened, as I mentioned, there ’s something—somewhere short of 25 million 
people have been displaced, even afte r the good May employment report.   What we ’re trying to 
do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job 
or to get a new job.  T hat’s—that ’s kind of the most important part of this exercise.  
And maybe these —it’s probably hopeful at this point to say that —that we won ’t have 
longer -run damage to the economy, and these numbers won’ t change.  So —but I think it’ s way 
too early to be —to be changing the longer run— see, these are—these are not meant to be short -
run numbers .  They’re called —they’ re longer -run assessments, so I —I would —I have not 
changed mine, and I ’m hopeful that —that I won ’t have to change it . 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Heather Long. 
HEATHER LONG.   Hi.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  I ’m struggling with two t hings 
that I hope  you can provide some clarity on.  The first is the ongoing bond buying program .  You 
say that it ’s needed to continue the smooth functioning of markets, but I guess most of us are n’t 
really seeing  a lot of  instability in markets right now.   So if you could kind of give us some 
clarity of what you’ re seeing that needs to continue to be smooth at that level and that pace.  
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 30 
 Second is, you know, you were just talking about  Fed concerns about small and medium -sized 
companies going out of bus iness during this .  And , I guess, you know, the Main Street Lending 
Program still isn ’t running yet .  When do you expect loans to start happening ?  And do you think 
the two -month delay has —has hurt the chances of some companies surviving? 
CHAIR POWELL.   There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to 
where you would say they were, for example, in—in February, before the pandemic arrived.  We 
don’t take those gains for granted , though.  This is a —this is a highly fluid situation , and we ’re—
we’re not taking those for granted.  And, in addition, as I pointed out in my—in my statement, 
those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative —or accommodative financial 
conditions, and that ’s—that ’s a good thing, so that ’s why we ’re doing that. 
Turning quickly to Main S treet, s o I would say that t he thing —what we ’ve done on Main 
Street, I think to a greater degree, is , we’ve listened to feedback.  So we ’ve been out repeatedly 
for feedback in trying to create a —a much more difficult pr oduct than, really , the other facilities.   
And I think this —this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the 
facility.   I think it ’s going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we ’ve used the 
time well, I think.  
And that —we are now in the —in the —in the final run -up to starting the facility.   What 
we did, as you saw earlier —I guess it ’s early this week or late , whenever we did it in the last few 
days—was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximu m loan size.   But , I 
think, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly.  So borrowers will get a —a two -year delay until they have to make any 
principal payments —repayments and a one -year dela y on interest.  So we had been hearing from 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 30 
 both borrowers and lenders that these would be very helpful.   We made the changes.  We’re 
putting them through the facility.  
The next step will be to register lenders.  At that time, loans can begin to be made.  
Shortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be —those loans can be 
sold—95 percent  of the loans .  And it’s 95 percent across the board now in the Main S treet 
facility can be sold.   So all of that should happen quickly now.  And I do think this has —this has 
been a challenging project, but I think we ’ve come to a—to a better place.   And , by the way, 
we’re—we ’re going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to.  A nd—and that ’s true of all of 
our facilities.   These are uniqu e.  There’s no— there ’s no playbook here.  You—you have to draw 
this up and then try it out.  And we ’ve—we ’ve been, you know, very willing to adapt and will 
continue to be. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay, Matt from Bloomberg.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.   Hello, Chai r Powell.   This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg 
News .  I wanted to ask you about regulatory forbearance.  There were some piecemeal 
forbearance measures put into place in various jurisdictions and also to a slice of the mortgage 
market to prevent banks from forecl osing on such debts amid the widespread financial hardships 
caused by the pandemic .  And with many of those set to expire soon and many businesses and 
households still in dire financial straits, I ’m wondering if any consideration is being given at the  
Fed to more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under just because they can ’t meet those payments.  There have, 
of course , been some tweaks to the Paycheck Protection P rogram on the fiscal side to address 
this, but I wanted to ask you about things you might be able to do on the regulatory side as well.  Thank you. 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 30 
 CHAIR POWELL.   We can—we can make changes to bank regulation and supervision.  
I don’ t know that we have the ability to make cha nges, for example, in mortgage payments, if 
that’s what you’ re thinking of, or credit card payments .  That’s really —that’s something that 
could be legislative, or it could just be what the —what the banks themselves are doing.   There ’s 
been a tremendous amount of forbearance on the part of the banks, and I guess our role there 
would be to encourage it, but those are not decisions that we hold any legal authority to make, and we —by the way, we have encouraged those decis ions.  I hope that ’s responsive to your 
question.  
 MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay.  Scott Horsley, NPR. 
SCOTT HORSLEY.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I know you’ re loathe to weigh in too 
heavily on fiscal policy, but given your forecast for elevated unemployment rates, do you think it’s important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level, 
and I ’ll—I’ll come to your specific question, but I would just say this :  This is the biggest 
economic shock in the U.S. and in the world, really, in living memory.  We went from the lowest 
level of employ—unemployment in 50 years to the highest level in close to 90 years, and we did it in two months .  Extraordinary.  And , appropriately, the response from fiscal authorities has 
been large, forceful, and very quick by—by the standards of these things.  Roughly $3 trillion 
Congress has authorized, and that ’s benefiting households ; laid-off workers ; small, medium, and 
large businesses;  hospitals ; state and local gove rnments —14 percent  of GDP .  It is—it’ s in a 
class by itself, in terms of both the size and the speed of it, and it ’s also pretty innovative.  
You know, the —both the PPP and the unemployment insurance are quite innovative in 
the American context, and there w ere difficulties in implementing it, but that ’s really a function 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 30 
 of—of their novelty, I think.  Those programs —by the way, let me add:  T he Fed also —we both 
innovated and acted forcefully, progressively, proactively, and aggressively as well.   If you put 
those together, all of that is making a difference now.   You look at the income data .  The 
expanded unemployment insurance and also the stimulus checks have gone a long way to 
replacing lost income from —from job loss.  I think you’ re seeing it in the job market data .  Many 
are giving the PPP credit on that front and —and in keeping small businesses going.  So it ’s—so 
far, it’ s a good response , and it ’s having—it ’s having a big effect.  You —you get to— the 
question is, it ’s big— everyone can see tha t it’s big.  Is it going to be big enough?   And that —that 
is the question .  And—and the question for —for —the question that I ’ve been concerned about, 
really, is this issue of longer -run damag e to the economy.  
We’re—we’re —we ’re doing a fair job of getting through these first few months , more 
than a fair job.   The question, though, is, that group of people who won’ t be able to go back to 
work quickly, what about them?   And that could be many millions of people, you know , parts —
who worked in parts of the ec onomy that will be the slow  ones  to recover.   And , you know, we 
want those people back in the labor force .  We want them getting jobs .  So—and—and they’ re 
going to need possibly— probably will need further support.  So I  will just say this :  It’s possible 
that we will need to do more, and it ’s possible that Congress will need to do more. 
In terms of the $600 unemployment insurance, I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’ t try to give 
Congress advice on the specifics of that.  I —I know they’ re looking at —I mean, I —I know from 
both talking to people and—and reading the papers that they ’re looking at a whole bunch of 
different possible approaches going forward, and some of those seem kind of promising.  So, you know, we ’re happy to give advice if people ask for it but —but probably not—not publicly.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  David Gura. 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 30 
 DAVID GURA.   Thank you, Chair Powell.  I ’m going to pick up on what Scott Horsley 
was asking just a moment ago.   You have been studious about threading this needle in the 
interviews that you’ ve giv en and speeches and the—the colloquy that ’s followed, not giving 
advice to Congress but indicating that there ’s likely to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or 
additional policy in the future .  So I’m going to try a hypothetical here, and you can rebuff it  if—
if you want. 
But if you were to find yourself in a —in a senator ’s office suite, and he held up that May 
unemployment report, which you’ ve described as unexpectedly positive and —and a welcome 
surprise, and if he or she said to you, “Look, this is an indication that we can put on the breaks, ” 
I wonder what you would say.  Your —your message throughout this crisis has been one of how 
unprecedented it is, about how much urgency there is in dealing with this .  Indeed, we ’ve seen 
that from the Federal Reserve.   I wonder if you worry that that sense of urgency isn ’t being 
matched and —and what the consequences of that might be, if there ’s a fear that the  Fed could be 
seen as a Cassandra here as we look at that unemployment report and then through the summer, 
and you have more and more politicians inclined just to wait and see what happens here in— in 
subsequent reports.  
And a quick second question, if I could .  You’ve talked a lot about your fear of  a second 
wave of this disease, and it strikes me, there’ s a—a difficulty here with definition.  You’ve 
talked about us weathering this crisis and getting through this storm .  It seems to me, as I listen 
to the chatter coming from the White House and from politicians and epidemiologists, there isn’ t 
agreement on what “ getting through this ” means.  A nd you have an A dministration now inclined 
to, if not direct, be content with states opening up their economies perhaps too early.  How 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 30 
 problematic is that from a policy perspective, not having agreement on what it means to have  
defeated this virus or gotten to a place where the economy can get through this ? 
CHAIR POWELL.   I can’t offer any advice, b ut I will provide a little context for the —
for—I want to be clear about the picture —one way to look at the picture, really, and that  is this :  
You can—you can get at this by looking at , you know, the —the —the widest measure of 
unemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U -6 measure.   And the U —that ’s the—
the one we look—talk about all the time is called U -3, by economists .  And the —the one that has 
a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U -6.  So in —in—in U -6, the U -6 level 
of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent  to 21  percent .  That—that amounts to 22 million 
additional people who are —who ’ve—who ’ve lost wor k in the economy either by going to part 
time or something like that .  So that ’s in the low 20s, and that ’s post the May employment report.  
You can get at it a different way .  You can look at —at just the regular unemployment 
rate.  You can take the 21  [million] —people  who have —ha d—are listed  as unemployed right  
now.  You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded.  Y ou can also take those people 
who are suddenly out of the labor force .  You put those together, a nd that has gone up by about 
24 million .  So those are two different measures of what ’s happened.  So the question is, 20, 22, 
24 million people —got to get them back to work.   Somehow, we ’ve got to all, as a country, get 
those people back to work.  They didn’ t do anything wrong;  this was a natural  disaster, and I —I 
really —I do think the response s so far have been great .  So that ’s the way I would think about it.  
And if —if you think we —I would just , in terms of the May employment report, it ’s—it’ s 
so nice to see.   I mean, I think what  people were thinking was that you ’d start to get those back -
to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August .  Very few people saw them in May.   I 
mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid -May, but it did.  And so, you know, and 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 30 
 we—we don’ t know fully what that means, whether it ’s just a timing change or whether it will 
prove to be much more than that .  We’ll—we ’re going to have to wait and see.  It is a —as I 
mentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and —and how humble we 
have to be about our ability to— to really have confident predictions as opposed to just 
predictions.  
So, bottom line, I would just say, that —that —the key thing people need to understand is 
that there ’s just a lot of work to do in the labor ma rket.  We’re going to stic k with this and 
support that  until the work is done .  That you—you can—that is something we ’re going to do 
with all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well.  It may, but that ’s going 
to be their decision.  
On—you also asked about the second wave.  So  we—you know, we have major 
responsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for 
elected officials at the state and local and federal level .  And, you know, if they a sk, we —we 
don’t have any pa rticular expertise here at the F ed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything 
like that.   We talk to experts, but —you know , so we don’ t have anything special to add on that.  I 
would just say, it ’s—you know, it ’s kind of self  evident, I think, that if a —if it happens , you 
know, the —the issue would be, first of all, people ’s health , but secondly, you could see a public 
loss of confidence in— in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover .  So it could 
hurt the recovery even if you don’ t have a national -level  pandemic, just a —just a series of —of 
local ones, of local spikes could —could have the effect of undermining people ’s confidence in 
traveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in 
small groups and feeding them or flying them around—those things could be hurt.  So it would not be a positive development, and I ’ll just leave it at that.  
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 30 
 MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question.  On Main 
Street l ending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55 —at least 55 companies file for 
bankruptcy.  Do you think that it is too late , first of all?   Second of all, the future of these 
facilities —is this a one -year impact to  the economy through these facilities, or is this a 
multiple -year?   If so, how many years?  
CHAIR POWELL.   We have , you know, significant interest, we think.  And also, 
remember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too.  The —the banks are lendi ng.  
The markets are open .  You know, you have a —a—a much better lending climate than —than 
certainly than we had in February and March.  W e don’ t think it’ s too late, though.  We —we —
and we do expect it to be up quite soon. 
In terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we ’ll leave them open as —we ’ll 
leave them open for new loans as long as they need to.  T hat’ll be a decision we make, of course, 
with our colleagues at the Treasury Department .  And, at a certain point, there won ’t be a need 
for furth er loans, and— and then the assets will —will be there.   And so if that ’s—I don’ t know if 
that’s a part of your question too, but I would just say that , at that point , you know, the —the  
useful role of the —of the Federal Reserve is probably close t o an end at  that point.  
We don’ t have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets, loans —if you will —or 
bonds, and we , you know, we don’ t want to be made —we don’ t really want to be part of the 
decisions th at have to be made to manage such a portfolio, so we ’d be looking to have that done 
either someplace else or , you know, by—by a third party or at the Treasury Department or 
something.  And we ’re, you know, we ’re working on ideas for that.  But our real focus now is 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 30 
 on—is getting these facilities going and —and ge tting them to do the job that they— they need 
to do. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Jonelle with Reuters.  
JONELLE MARTE.   Thank you, Chair.  So I have two quick questions.  One is if we 
have hit bottom for  the economy, and the second question is regarding the —the way that the 
pandemic has exacerbated racial inequality.   I wanted to ask, to what extent do you think you can 
factor in both disparities when you’ re thinking a bout maximum employment ? 
CHAIR POWELL.   I would say that many forecasters had been expectin g a bottom for 
the economy in—around the middle of the year, with—with a huge range of uncertainty.  I think 
the labor market— the evidence of one jobs  report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in 
May.   We don ’t know that ; we’re going to see.  And , you know, many forecasters widely expect 
a—a recovery over the second half of the year .  So it—it is possible, but the thing is, we ’re not 
going to overreact to a single data point.  We ’re going to be very careful about reaching any 
conclusions about —about good data or bad data .  So, I think , you know, we ’re going to be here 
with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it ’s needed.  So —but I think there ’s a 
possibility that —that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don’ t know that yet.   
We’ll—we ’ll know more as we go forward.  
So, in terms of the —you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see — 
the pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are—that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they’ re—it’ s the travel, 
leisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service -economy jobs.  And so a lot of the lost jobs were 
from people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively —compared to other jobs, relatively low wages.  So, and if —if you just look at what 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 30 
 that is, unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African Americans .  And 
women have borne —borne an extraordinary— a notable share of the burden beyond their 
percentage in the workforce.  
So that ’s really —really,  really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months, 
where we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter -century.  A nd 
for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for 
people at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great.   And , you know, we were 
meeting with people from low - and—low - and moderate -income  communities  all over the 
country and hearing, “D on’t change this .  Do whatever  you—do whatever you can.   Keep this 
going.  T his is the best labor market we ’ve seen. ” And we had every expect —every expectation, 
every reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes.   So it ’s—it’s heartbreaking, 
and, you know, we want to get it back, so—we really want to get it back.  
And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years .  One 
of them is that , you know, I —you—you can have 3, 3½ percent  unemployment for a couple of 
years, and , really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in 
inflation.   So that was not anybody’ s understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or 
most peoples ’, anyway.  
So we can use our tools to —to support the labor market and support the economy.  We 
can—we can use them until we do fully recover, and that —that’s what we ’re planning to do.  
You know, we don’ t target different groups .  What—what we are—we are cognizant of t he fact , 
though, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for —for the first time in many years when labor 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 30 
 markets are tight, when unemployment is low .  And so we  would really like to get back to that —
get back to that place.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Victoria from Politico.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, I’m Victoria Guida with Politico.   I just wanted to follow up on 
a couple of things that are —have already been asked.  First of all, on fiscal policy, you all 
obviously put out your Summary of E conomic P rojections today , and I ’m curious to what extent 
future fiscal policy is factored in or not factored in to those projections, and—and how, more or 
less, fiscal policy might affect those projections .  And then my other question is on —on Main 
Street.  Y ou’ve mentioned multiple times that , you know, the  Fed and T reasury are willing to 
expand the program further.  So my question is, what ’s the threshold for those types of changes?  
Is it just making sure that borrowers that want to borrow through the program are —are —are able 
to do that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  In terms of the  way—the way we do forecasts is, we —we don’ t—
the—we don’ t tend to incorporate things we ’re highly uncertain about.  So I thin k the —the 
forecast would not have included substantial additional —you know, big additional fiscal support 
for the economy.  M aybe —maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a —a low -end 
guess on what might come out of the current negotiations .  That’s basically what would be in the 
baseline.   So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you’ d see—you’ d see better results 
sooner, but that ’s a question for Congress.  You know, we ’re—we ’re spending a lot , and that ’s 
really what they get to decide.  
In terms of Main S treet and our willingness to expand it further, I think we ’re—one thing 
we’re looking at —very strongly looking at is —is nonprofits, and is there a way to—to 
incorporate them into—into  that facility or a similar facility .  So that ’s another dimension.  I —
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 30 
 you know, if we  had a great idea for changing Main S treet, we would’ ve done it .  And we —and 
we have done some things that I think are really very positive lately here.  But if we —as we 
learn more, it could be —it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different 
things.  But I —I think we have a good product to go to market with now , and I think it ’ll get —
it’ll get out there soon.  A nd, you know, we ’ll see, and —and we ’ll be willing to continue 
to adapt.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Don Lee. 
DON LEE.   Chair Powell , as you know, the vast majority of people who have been laid 
off are expecting to be recalled by their employers.   At this point, what is your expectation of 
how much of these job losses will be permanent?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I don’t have a reliable estimate o f that.   Clearly, not everyone will go 
back.  But —and I —I would say, many will go back, but what ’s—what ’s going to be the 
remainder when —you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal?   It’s—it’s so 
uncer tain, but it —it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many —in many 
estimates, b ut these —I’d say you’ re so early in the process.  People are —for example, people are 
going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they’ ve seen how many 
people go back when, for example, there ’s a technological change, and things like that —you 
may have seen some of this research —and you come up with an estimate .  I—you know, it ’s just 
going to be very hard to say. 
I—I, but I —my—my ass umption is that there will be a significant chunk —chunk well 
into the millions.   I—I don ’t want to give you a number , because it ’s going to be a guess , but 
well, well into the millions of people who —who don’ t get to go back to their old job.  And, in 
fact, there isn ’t a—there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time.  There will 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 30 
 eventually be, but it could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs.  I 
mean, when—when people lose a job, if they can find a job in their own industry, that ’s usually 
the fastest way, is—is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs .  That’s 
usually the fastest.   If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it ’s much 
harder, and that ’s where you start to lose people ’s—who are —just fall out of the labor force.   
And—and, you know, it ’s very tough on their lives.  We all know people who—to whom that 
happened in the Global F inancial C risis, and, hence, our desire to—to do what we can to support 
this and— and—an d support this recovery with— with the tools that we have. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   Nancy Marshall -Genzer,  Marketplace.  Chair Powell, 
I’m wondering—I want to go back to the issue of inequality, and I’m won dering, what more 
could the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in this country?   I mean, I know that you said 
you don’ t target certain groups, but is there a way that you could use, for example, the black 
unemployment rate as —as some kind of a benchmark to something you ’d want to meet or 
something that you’d  keep track of?  
CHAIR POWELL.   We do.  We do t rack all unemployment by all kinds, as you know —
all kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African  American unemployment 
rate, which reached an all -time low since the data started being kept in the modern era.   Of 
course, it ’s still close to twice the white unemployment —it is twice the unemployment rate, or it 
was back  in the —back  then.  It’s certainly much higher now.  
You know, the —the  best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to—is to look 
at, you know, the evidence of what we saw —that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which 
is that the economy can have very low unemployment —very low unemployment .  It could’ ve 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 30 
 been low er than we were.  I t could be lower than 3½ percent  without seeing financial 
imbalances, without seeing inflation going—getting out of control.  We, frankly, didn ’t even get 
inflation back up to target —without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with wh ere they 
should be, so that ’s the—that ’s the biggest thing we can do. 
You know, in—in —inequality is something that ’s been with us increasingly for more 
than four decades , and it ’s—it’s not really related to monetary policy .  It’s, or—or it ’s more 
related to —there are a lot of theories on —on what causes it, but it ’s been something that ’s more 
or less been going up consistently for more than four decades .  And there are a lot of different 
theories, one of which is —just is that it—globalization —globalization and technology call for 
rising levels of skills and aptitudes and education, and that  U.S. educational attainment kind of 
flattened out, certainly relative to our peers —flattened out over that period. 
And so a lot —so that means if you’ re—if you’ re on the r ight side of those trends, then 
those things are good for you.  If you’ re not, then your wages are going to stagnate .  And wages 
for the bottom , you know, 10 percent  really haven ’t gone up in real terms in a very long time , 
and—over a long period of time,  whereas wages for the people at the top , compensation, any 
way you cut it —before taxes, after taxes, after transfers, all of those, any way you cut it —wages 
have —compensation has gone up a whole lot for people at the top, and it really hasn’ t gone up 
for people at the bottom.  If you look more in the middle, then it ’s—then—then it has gone up 
for most other groups , but at the bottom, not so much in real terms, in  inflation -adjusted  terms.  
So, you know, we —we call it out as a—as an important factor in the e conomy, and we 
will use our tools to support maximum employment and take that , you know, definition to heart.  
But, obviously, that ’s something that ’s going to require an all -of-society, all -of-government  
response.  
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 30 
 MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  For the last  question, we’ll go to Michael McKee with 
Bloomberg TV . 
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio.  
I came across a statistic the other day that amazed me.   Since your March 23 emergency 
announcement, every single stock in the S &P 500 has delivered a  positive return.  And I’m 
wondering, given the levels of the market right now, whether you or your colleagues feel there is 
a possible bubble blowing that could pop and set  back the recovery significantly, or that we 
might see capital misallocation that will leave us worse off when this is over . 
Second, inequality is not just about wages, it ’s also about wealth.  A nd a number of 
studies have suggested that by keep ing rates low for so long and targeting the markets after the 
great financial crisis, that the Fed did contribute to wealth inequality in this country.   And I ’m 
wondering if you think there is some tweak or some message you could give that would 
affect  that. 
CHAIR POWELL.   What we ’ve targeted is broader financial conditions.  If you go back 
to the end of February and early March, you had—basically , the world markets realized at just 
about the same time —I remember that Monday —that there was going to be a global pandemic , 
and that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen.  It all—it was —you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then 
it became clear in markets.   From that point forw ard, investors everywhere in the world, for a 
period of weeks , wanted to sell everything that wasn ’t cash or a —a short -term Treasury  
instrument.   They didn’ t want it to have any risk at all.  And so what happened is , markets 
stopped working.  They stopped working, and companies couldn’ t—couldn’ t borrow .  They 
couldn’ t roll over their debt.   People couldn’ t borrow.  So that ’s—that ’s the kind of situation that 
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 30 
 can be  very—financial turbulence and malfunction—a  financial system that ’s not working can 
greatly amplify the negative effects of what was clearly going to be a major economic shock.  
So what our tools were —were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function.  
And I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I —as I ment ioned in my opening 
remarks, and that ’s a good thing.  So we —we ’re not looking to achieve a particular level of any 
asset price.   What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do.  
Borrowers are borrowing .  Lenders are lendin g.  We want the markets to be working.   And , 
again, we ’re not looking to—to a particular level.  
I think our —our principal focus , though, is on —on the state of the economy and on the 
labor market and on inflation.  Now, inflation, of course, is —is low, and we think it ’s very likely 
to remain low for some time , below our target.   So, really, it ’s about getting the labor market 
back and getting it in shape .  That’s—that ’s been our major focus.  And I would say,  you know, 
we—if we were to hold back because—we would never do this, but —the idea that, just the 
concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high —others may not 
think so, but we just decided that that ’s the case —what would happen to those people?   You 
know, what woul d happen to the people that we ’re actually legally supposed to be serving?   
We’re supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that ’s what we ’re 
pursuing.  
We’re also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system tha t is so 
much better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks, 
more highly liquid.  You have all of those things .  And they’ ve been lending.  T hey’ve been 
taking in deposits .  They’ve been a source of strength in this situation.  
June 10, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 30 of 30 
 So I would say that , you know, we ’re tightly focused on our real economy goals.  And —
and, again, not —we ’re not —we ’re not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at 
all.  It’s just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we’ ve done, 
they—they are working.  A nd, you know, we hope that continues.  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  
July 29, 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  The  pandemic continues to cause tremendous 
human and economic hardship here in the Unit ed States and around the world.  The most 
important response to this public health crisis has come from our health -care workers, and we 
remain grateful to them and to the many other essential workers for putting themselves at risk 
day after day in service to others and to our country.  All of us have a role to play in our nation ’s 
response to the pandemic.  At the Federal Reserve, we remain committed to using our tools to do what  we can, and for as long as it takes, to provide some relief and stability, to ensure that the 
recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  
In recent months, economic activity picked up as the economy began to reopen.  Many 
businesses opened their doors, factories restarted production, and more people left their homes to 
engage in various activities.  As a result , household spending looks to have recovered about half 
of its earlier decline, although spending for services such as air travel and hotels has shown much 
less of a pickup.  The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus 
payments and expanded unemployment benefits , which provided substantial and timely support 
to household incomes.  In contrast, indicators of business fixed investment have yet to show a recovery.  Even with the improved economic news in May and June, overall activi ty remains 
well below its level before the pandemic, and the contraction in real GDP in the second quarter will likely be the largest on record.  
The labor market has followed a similar pattern.  After precipitous drops in March and 
April, employment rose s trongly in May and June as many people returned to work from 
temporary layoffs.  As a result, of the roughly 22 million jobs that had been lost, about one -third 
had been regained as of the June payroll report.  The unemployment rate declined in May and 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 29 
 June but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the 
peak during the Global F inancial C risis.  In addition, t he downturn has not fallen equally on all 
Americans, and those least able to bear  the burden have been the most affected.  In particular, the 
rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers, for women, and for 
African Americans and Hispanics.  This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives 
and created great uncertainty about the future . 
The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  For some goods, including 
food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income.  More broadly, however, w eaker demand, especially in sectors —
such as travel and hospitality —that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down 
consumer prices, and , overall, inflation is running well below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  
Along with the recent increases in economic activity have come new challenges.  After 
declining gradually from a peak near the end of April, the number of COVID -19 cases has 
increased sharply in many parts of the country since mid -June.  We have thus entered a new 
phase in containing the virus, whic h is essential to protect both our health and our economy.  As 
we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, t he path forward for the economy is 
extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.  Indeed, we  have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the 
renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity.  For example, some measures of consumer spending based on debit  card  and credit card use have moved down since 
late June, while recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, especially among smaller businesses.   A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’ s safe to 
reengage in a broad range of activities.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 29 
 The path forward will also depend on policy actions taken at all levels of government to 
provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.  The Federal Reserve ’s response 
to this crisis  has been  guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable 
prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the 
financial system.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.  We have held our policy rate nea r zero  since mid -March and have stated 
that we will keep it there until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  We’ve been 
purchasing sizable quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed securities in order to 
support orderly conditions in the markets, which are vital to the flow of credit in the economy.  To sustain smooth market functioning and foster effective transmission of monetary policy to broade r financial conditions, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury and agency 
mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace.  These purchases are also fostering more 
accommodative financial conditions.  
The Federal Reserve has also been  taking broad and forceful actions to more directly 
support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small , and for 
state and local governments.  Without access to credit, families could be forced to cut back on necessities or even lose their homes.  Businesses could be forced to downsize or close, resulting in further job  losses and income  losses and worsening the downturn.  Preserving the flow of 
credit is thus essential for mitigating the damage to the economy and promot ing the  recovery.  
Many of our  programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the 
Treasury Department and are available only in very unusual circumstances , such as those we find 
ourselves in today.  These programs benefit the economy by providing financing where it is not 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 29 
 otherwise available.  In addition, by serving as a backstop to key credit markets, the programs  
appear to have significantly increased the extension of credit from private lenders.  We are 
deploying these lending powe rs to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial 
backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  We will continue to use these powers until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.  This week we extended these programs through the end of the year.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will 
put these emergency tools back in the toolbox.  
As I have emphasized before,  these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed 
cannot grant money to particul ar beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with 
broad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will 
be repaid.  Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these 
cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and 
to make decisions about where we, as a society, should di rect our collective resources.  T he 
fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, 
businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels  of economic activity 
and employment that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and it will take continued support 
from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.  
Before taking your questions, I ’ll provide an update on our review of our monetary policy 
framework.  [Clears throat]  Excuse me.  As a reminder, we began this public review of our 
monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices —a first for the Federal Reserve—
early last year.  Our purpose has been to take a comprehensive look at how we can best meet our 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 29 
 maximum -employment and price -stability objectives in the years ahead, particularly in light of 
the generally lower level of interest rates around the world.  As is evident in our current 
situation, the lower level of interest rates has reduced the scope for the Committee to support the 
economy by cutting interest rates.  Our plans  to conclude this review were, like so many things, 
delayed by the pandemic.  At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions.  Our focus was on possible enhancements to our Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary 
Policy Strategy.  This doc ument states our goals, articulates our approach to monetary policy, 
and serves at the foundation—as the foundation for our policy actions.  While I do not have any 
details to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progr ess and will 
wrap up our deliberations in the near future. 
We understand that the work of the Fed touches communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to 
using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from 
this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I will look forward to your 
questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  James Politi . 
JAMES POLITI.  Hi there .  James Politi with the F inancial Times .  Chair Powell, the Fed  
today decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the 
world.  Why was that important for the Fed ?  And how concerned are you about dollar shortages 
persisting over  time through the pandemic?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, s o our —our  dollar swap lines —we introduced those back at 
the beginning of —of this episode after the pandemic made itself present.  And dollar funding 
markets were in very difficult shape at the time.  And  the introduction of the swap lines has 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 29 
 really restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity.  And 
so they kind of served their purpose.  But we extended them —I guess , yesterday morning —
really to facilitate planning b y other central banks and just so people will know that those 
facilities are still there.  
We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed.  And since, 
you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from —from  the pandemic are far from over, we ’re 
going to leave those in place for the time being.  And we ’ll leave them in place until we ’re 
confident that they ’re no longer needed.  There ’s nothing that ’s going on in the market right now 
that raises any concerns.  It’ s just , we want th em to be there as a backstop for markets.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Steve Lie sman.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.   I hope  that you can hear me.  Mr. 
Chairman, given—you’ ve said several times now that you have lending , not spending,  powers.  
Given that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really , barely used, do 
you think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is  now saying that money is limited and they 
shouldn’t take —they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill?  Is this money doing the best 
for the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don ’t seem to be being used all 
that much right now?   Thank you.  A nd I have a follow -up, sir.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  they—that —that’s really a question for Congress.  They —they  
appropriated that money, and—$454 billion for our facilities, and it ’s really a question for them.  
So you’ re right that our facilities  have not —we haven ’t done as much lending as we thought.  
But, in very substantial measure, that ’s because markets started working again fairly soon after 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 29 
 we announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni —in the  
muni  space, and also in the short -term funding facilities —the three of those that we set up.  So 
we didn’ t turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would. 
On the other hand, it ’s important that the facilities stay in place , and that ’s why w e 
extended them yesterday.  It’s important that they still stay in place until we ’re, you know, very 
confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us.  So I—I 
can’t really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it ’s important that the facilities be 
there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road.  We don ’t see them now, but , 
in case they do arise, they should be there.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Has any consideration —thank you.  Has any consideration been 
given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Not th at I’m aware of, no. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nick Timira os.  [No response]  Nick, are you there?  
[No response]  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.  [Aside]  I didn’t hear you say that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  We’ll go to David Gura, NBC.  
DAVID GURA.  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.  No doubt you were paying 
attention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from —from  lawmakers.  A nd a question they each answered had to do with the 
continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits.  And something we ’ve heard a lot is that 
they could be a disincentive to work.  Both of them addressed  that.  I wonder if you would 
as well.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 29 
 And then, as a follow -up, I wonder what you’ ve learned about the degree to which this 
has led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are 
experiencing two different kinds of —of pandemics here.  Some are getting through this based on 
what they’ ve saved and the jobs that they have.  Others are really struggling to get by .  And I 
wonder what role —what additional role the Fed  could have in, sort of , bridging that —that  
yawning gap. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on your first question, I wouldn’ t want to be giving very detailed, 
specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing.  I just will say the following, that, you know, this —this  pandemic and its  fallout really represents 
the biggest shock to the U .S. economy in living memory.  We went from the lowest levels of 
unemployment we ’d had in 50 years to the highest levels we ’ve had in 90 years , and we did it in 
the space of two months .  And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was 
strong, it was fast, it was broad—and appropriately so.  And I think we are seeing the results of 
the earlier strong fiscal actions . 
When you see the spending that ’s happening, when you see small businesses  staying in 
business even though the economy hasn’ t fully , successfully , sustainably reopened yet in many 
places, you are seeing what happens with that —that  money.  And so, in —in a broad sense, it ’s 
been well  spent .  It’s kept people in their homes .  It’s kept businesses in business.  A nd that ’s all 
a good thing .  I think , in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more 
support from us and from more fiscal policy.  Fiscal policy is up to Congress .  You see the 
ongoing discussions that  they ’re having.  And it suggests to me that there ’s—you know, that 
both sides, they’ re wrangling over —over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is 
a need for some additional fiscal support . 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 29 
 And the last thing I ’ll say is that if the expansion —even if —sorry .  Even if the reopening 
goes well and many, many people go back to work, it ’s still going to take a fairly long time for 
the parts of the economy that are —that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity.  
And that me ans that many of the people who were laid off from those industries —and that ’s 
restaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and 
accommodation—m any of those people are going to find it hard to go back—t hey can’ t go back 
to their old job.  There won’ t be enough jobs for them .  So I think those people are going to need 
support .  I can ’t say what the exact level should be .  It’s not our role .  But they ’re going to need 
support if they’ re to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their 
current rental house or— or apartment or a house if they own it .  So I think there will be a need.  
In terms of inequality , really —so I think it ’s fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic 
have fallen  on, heav ily—they’ ve fallen on everyone, but they’ ve fallen very heavily on people 
who work in the service industries in relatively low -paying jobs .  So there was a—a  figure that 
came out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, the n 
40 percent —you had a 40 percent  chance of losing your job in April and May.  So it ’s falling 
very heavily on—on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that .  
And that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women.  So that ’s just what the 
pandemic is doing. 
You know, in terms of what we ’re doing, what we ’re trying to do is create an 
environment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to t heir old job or to a new job.  That ’s really what 
we’re doing.  Everything we do is directed at that . 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 29 
 And, you know, the —I would say—I would say one last thing on inequality.  That is , 
inequality is a—is an issue —has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for 
four decades .  And you see it —it has many faces.  You see it in the relative flattening -out of —of 
incomes for people in low and—lower and middle  income s as compared to those at the top.  You 
see it in low mobility where people —where the  chances of moving up from the bottom to the 
middle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy 
countries .  So it ’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it ’s—it’s  got underlying 
causes that are not rela ted to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic . 
Again, four decades of evidence suggests it ’s about globalization.  I t’s about the 
flattening -out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor 
countries .  It’s about technology advancing, too.  If you ’re on the wrong side of those forces, it ’s 
been —your income has stagnated.  So it ’s—it’s a critical, critical problem for our society , but 
one that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies .  Our part  of it is to —is to  push as 
hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability.  We saw what 
happened to people at —at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion.  It 
was the best labor market in 50  years, they told u s.  We saw that the biggest wage increases were 
going to people at  the bottom end of the —of the  wage spectrum for the last couple of years of 
that 10 -year, 8- month expansion.  So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed  
can foster to —to go after that —that problem , which is a —a serious one.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  And now , Nick Timir aos. 
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Yeah .  [Inaudible] Journal.  Chair Powell, you have described your 
asset purchase objective as stabilizing markets.  And with markets having stabilized, aren ’t the 
asset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 29 
 macroeconomic objectives?  The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with 
respect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So you’ re right, the asset purchases in —in their current size really 
sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic .  And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored—not 
fully , but substantially restored functioning markets .  This is absolutely critical.  That market is 
really one of the —it’s part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial mar kets, and it ’s—it’s 
essential that it —that it work well, and it is doing so now . 
And we ’ve always said , though, that we understand, accept , and are fine with the fact 
that—that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary poli cy, 
which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes .  So it ’s doing both, and— and, you 
know, we ’ve understood that for some time .  It’s not —the programs are not structured exactly 
like the —the  QE programs were in the last —in the last  financial —in the aftermath of the last 
financial crisis.  Those were more focused on buying longer -run securities.  The current 
purchases are all across the—the  maturity spectrum .  Nonetheless, they are supporting 
accommodative financial conditions .  I think it ’s—it’s  clear that that’ s the case.  
In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen.  We—as you know, 
we’ve spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our 
current stance of policy .  We do feel that our curren t monetary policy stance is the appropriate 
one.  You know, we cut rates close t o zero right at the beginning.  W e—we ramped up asset 
purchases, and those —those  have really helped.  And we gave forward guidance on— on both of 
those things , which the markets  appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 29 
 those .  So we think we’re —we think  that our —our  policy stance is a good one .  We’re, of 
course , prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to —to 
better foste r achievement of our goals , of course . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay.  Jeanna . 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking my question.  You talked 
to Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April , and May , according to your public calendars.  I was 
wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about , and, if the topic of those 
conversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of 
interest during those conversations?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, so —so BlackRock is just our agent .  You know, we make the 
policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues , and they just execute our —our  plans .  I 
actually don ’t remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about , but he’s a—you 
know, he ’s the h ead of a major service provider .  He generally checks in to find out whether 
we’re okay with the quality of the service that —that BlackRock is providing.  I don’ t have the 
daily face -to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or —or, as you can see,  three 
phone calls in the course of a few months .  It wasn ’t very many. 
So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual 
arrangements we have with them .  And, again, I would have —I—I can ’t recall exactly what 
those c onversations were, but they were —they would have been about what are you seeing in the 
markets and things like that too—you know, generally exchanging information.  And he ’s—he’s  
typically trying to make sure that—that  we are getting good service from the company that he 
founded and leads .  That’s —I’d say that ’s his main objective when we talk.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay, thank you.  We’ll go to Scott Horsle y. 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 29 
 SCOTT HORSLEY .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Scott Horsl ey from NPR .  I wonder if 
you can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month 
and what, if anything, that tells  us about the , sort of , economic circulatory system . 
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes.  So—the situation with coins is that the—the  quantity of coins 
is going up but was adequate before the pandemic .  The problem is , the circulation kind of 
stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed .  It just—customers weren ’t spending, 
they were —so the coins stopped moving in the system .  So we ’ve been working for —ever since 
that began to happen, we saw it happening right away.  We’ve been working to try to —try to  
reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins .  So we ’re 
working with the  U.S. Mint , which is the issuing authority , to address the issue.  Just last week, 
the M int—you may have seen —issued a statement asking for the public ’s help  in keeping coins 
circulating, a nd various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation. 
We also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders —you know, banks and, you 
know, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions , everybody in the —in the  coin 
supply chain .  We’re in frequent communication with the banks and with the —with the  armored 
carriers tryin g to get back to where we need to be .  So we do think the inventories are building 
up.  You know, the M int—the Mint  is making coins as fast as they can, but —but , you know, 
things happen with —in the factory environment :  Someone will come to work with COVID —I 
think this has happened in —in almost every factory environment around the country —and then 
they’ ll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing.  So —so  we’re 
closely monitoring it .  It’s —you know, it ’s a significant issue.  We’ve—we’ve  got a lot of 
resources on it , and we do feel like we’ re—we’re  making progress.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay, thank you.  Rachel Siegel . 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 29 
 RACHEL SIEGEL .  Hey, Chair Powell .  Thank you for taking my question.  I ’m 
wondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double -dip 
recession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stall ing, compared to some of 
the signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer .  Thanks very much.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Yeah .  So maybe I ’ll talk more broadly about the —the  outlook and 
include your —include your  question in it .  So, as I mentioned, economic activity and 
employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well  below their 
levels because, I ’d say , job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and 
April, a nd consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop.  So —but , nonetheless, those 
were —those were  sooner and stronger than we expecte d.  So —but what happened then was , 
along with that positive data, we got —we got  the virus increases starting in the middle of June in 
lots and lots of states around the country.  And that brings us to a new —a new  point here , which 
is, we need to —in addition to dealing with the health crisis —we have to remember , this is really 
a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus , and it’s taking a terrible toll, 
so we ’ve got to deal with the economic ramifications of that . 
So what we ’re seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we —what we  think of as sort 
of nonstandard, high- frequency data .  That ’s become a very important thing, even more 
important than usual in the work that we do.  And what that data show , on balance , is that the 
pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June.  So some 
measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down.  
Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, partic ularly among smaller 
businesses.  Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out .  People aren ’t going out to restaurants, 
bars, gas stations, pharmacies , and beauty salons as much.  Consumer surveys, by the way, 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 29 
 which had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply—
they look like they may be softening again now . 
There are still some areas of strength .  Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been 
strong.  Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowi ng in the pace of the 
recovery.  But I want to stress, it ’s—it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained 
it will be .  We just don ’t know yet, because we have to wait for —to see the, you know, the actual 
data on spending and employment com e in, and —but this —this is what we ’re seeing, and , of 
course , we’re monitoring it very carefully . 
And I ’d be remiss in not stressing this enough.  The path of the economy is going to 
depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus  and on the measures that we take to keep 
it in check .  That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now .  The two things 
are not in conflict.  You know, social -distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, 
they actually go together .  They ’re not in competition with each other.  So — 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Chris Ruga ber. 
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi .  Well, just to follow up on that a bit —and thanks for 
taking my question—you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy 
depends on the path of the virus .  Is this —do you feel this idea , or this view , is not widely 
enough understood?  Do you feel —you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an 
incautious reopening might harm the economy.  Do you feel that message was not heard , and that 
some of these reopenings took place  perhaps  sooner than they should have?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I think we feel that it —it might be , the most central fact 
or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus .  And you’ re seeing 
that again now .  You saw that in the —during the lockdown when we got cases way down, a nd 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 29 
 you saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up.  And now that 
the—that the  cases have spiked again —again , the early data, the high -frequency data suggest 
that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now .  We don ’t know how deep or how long 
that will be .  So it’s such an important sentence .  We just decided that it needed to be in our —in 
our postmeeting st atement .  It’s so fundamental .  And, you know, I think we can’ t say it enough.  
It’s—it’s really important. 
We’re —you know, you can think of it as three  stages.  There ’s the lockdown, and we 
know what that looks like, and we ’ll get the data , I guess , later this week on GDP being down 
very historically large amounts .  Then there was the reopening, a nd we would expect that many, 
many people would go back to work.  Those w hose jobs could be done without —you know, 
without exposure to lots of people in tight groups , they should have been —they should be able to 
go back to work during that phase fairly quickly .  But that would depend on being able to keep 
the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social -distancing 
measures.  So that ’s where we are.  It’s such an important factor .  It’s—it’s in—we ’re all talking 
about it , so we thought it really had to be in the statement. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Mike McKee. 
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Mr. Chairman, I ’m wondering what it is —you ’ve talked a lot 
about using all of your tools , and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to 
accommodation—w hat it is you can actually do.  Y ou’ve lowered rates to zero .  Yo u’ve set up 
the lending programs .  There hasn ’t been much take -up.  And the tools you talk about are 
generally in service of keeping interest rates low , where they already are.  So unless you were to 
go to negative interest rates, I ’m wondering what additional accommodation the Fed  can bring.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 29 
 Or is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to —to add 
additional help for it?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So you’ re right.  We are committed to using our full ra nge of 
tools to support the  U.S. economy at this difficult time , and we will always remain committed in 
that sense.  We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our 
credit and liquidity facilities , which are effectively unlim ited.  We can adjust those programs.  
We also can adjust our forward guidance.  We can adjust our asset purchases.  So there are things 
that we can do .  We—we  feel like we have the ability to do more . 
But I would not disagree with the —with the  importance o f fiscal policy —with your 
statement about the importance of fiscal policy .  Fiscal policy can do—can address things that 
we can ’t address.  I f there are particular groups that need help , that need direct monetary help—
not a loan, but an actual grant  as the PPP program showed— you can save a lot of businesses and 
a lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer .  
The company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can’ t work because 
there ’s no business .  So lending is a particular tool , and we ’re using it very aggressively.  
But fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say , again, Congress ’s action early in the 
pandemic —historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S. 
standards—i t’s really helping now .  It’s really helping .  It’s going to stand up very well  to—to 
scrutiny down the years .  This  Congress ’s very fa st and very open- handed response, I think, has 
really helped .  And I think—I know that, as I ’ve said, ver y likely more will be needed from —
from  all of us, a nd I see Congress negotiating now over —over  a new package , and I think that ’s 
a good thing. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay.  Edward Lawrence.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 29 
 EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So you 
talked about it several times today :  The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy 
is linked to the path of the virus .  It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October 
or toward s the end of the year .  Has the C ommittee talked about how that might change Fed  
policies?  And , as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it 
to be?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So we —of course , the concept of vaccines comes up in our 
discussions .  Of co urse it does .  But I have to say, you know, we’re —our job is not to plan for 
the upside case, right?  The upside case—we ’ve got that covered.  Our job is to plan for all —the 
full range of things that could happen.  And so we ’re assuming —we ’re going to cont inue to 
assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed , and that the public needs —you 
know, needs  the support that we ’re giving the public until —until shown otherwise .  There ’s great 
uncertainty around the development of therapeutics a nd vaccines .  All of us want them to happen 
as soon as possible, but we can ’t plan on that .  We’ve got to hope for the worst —hope for the  
[laughs ]—hope for the  best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes . 
In terms of inflation, I don ’t know .  I mean, I —you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a 
disinflationary shock.  I know there —there  is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to 
inflation over time , but, you know, we ’re—we’re  seeing disinflationary pressures around the 
world going into this .  Now  we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 
1 percent .  And I do think for quite some time we ’re going to be struggling against 
disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Ann Sa phir. 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 29 
 ANN SAPHIR.  Hi .  Yes, thanks for taking my question.  So , I mean, as you monitor the 
rising infections and the slowing pace of the recover y, could you speak to , what would the 
trigger be for doing further easing?   And on the flip side of that, whe n would it be reasonable to 
expect the Fed to consider raising rates again?  Thanks . 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, you know, as we ’ve said, we’ re carefully monitoring the 
situation .  We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, an d we ’ve been monitoring the  
situation.  And I think the markets and—and the economy—you know, I think our policy is in a 
good place .  But we ’ve looked at —at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we ’re 
ready to do that when we think it ’s appropriate .  I can ’t give you a specific trigger .  It really just 
is when we think it would help:   Would it help more than what we ’re doing now to foster 
maximum employment and stable prices? 
Sorry, your second question was?  [ Inaudible ]  I can ’t hear you .  Say it again?  
ANN SAPHIR.  Sorry —for when it would be reasonable for the Fed  to consider 
raising — 
CHAIR POWELL.  Oh. 
 ANN SAPHIR.  —rates again.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So as I —as I  said earlier , or a while back, we ’re not even thinking 
about —thinking about  raising rates.  We’re—we’ re totally focused on providing the economy 
the support that it will need .  We think that the economy will need highly accommodative 
monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.  And we ’re absolutely 
committed to staying in this until —until we ’re very confident that that is no longer needed.  So I 
wouldn’ t look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that 
for a very long time .  We’re—we’re  in this until —until  we’re well through it.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 29 
 And I think this —you know, I think the picture is , you have the —you have the  lockdown, 
then you have the reopening.  But there ’s probably going to be a long tail where a large number 
of people are struggling to get back to work because those —those  heavily affected areas of  the 
economy are going to be challenged , really , to employ the millions of people who are now out of 
work .  I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something 
like that.  So that ’s going to take a while , I think , in everyone ’s reckoning.  And I just —everyone 
should know that we ’re going to be there for all of that.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Cata rina with Bloomberg . 
CATARINA SARAIVA.  Hi, Chair .  Thanks for taking our questions .  You mentioned 
earlier that the labor mark et we had in February was the best we’ ve had in 50 years, yet at that 
point the B lack unemployment rate was still double that of whites .  So I wanted to ask you, you 
know, we ’ve seen some economists and even  the Biden campaign call for the Fed  to more 
specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates .  Even if you don’ t get a 
mandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going 
forward?  And how would you do that?  
And then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm ’s writings from 
last night.  She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed —described harassment 
and professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to.  Is this your F ederal R eserve?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Okay .  So, first,  on the unemployment, you’ re right .  And we always 
point this out in our —in our  remarks.  While the aggr egate unemployment rate was 3 ½ percent , 
every —every  economy —every market in every economy has longer -run issues .  And one of ours 
is just the disparate level of unemployment between —between  Blacks and whites.  And it ’s 
generally sort of twice as much —twice as high for B lacks.  So even—but this was the lowest, 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 29 
 you know, B lack unemployment rate in 50 years —or, actually , sinc e we started keeping records, 
which was less than 50 years ago .  So that ’s just a fact , and it ’s—it’s  not a good fact, you know. 
So we have started , though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on 
disparate levels of unemployment —for example, among—among different racial groups and 
demographic groups .  We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions.  We call 
them out in testim ony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report  to Congress .  You ’ll 
see it everywhere, i n all the things that we do. 
So what does that mean?  I think —you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor 
market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income 
spectrum generally .  But  it—you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years —it took sort of the 
8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits .  So we need more than that .  
That’s not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there.  So we ’re—we’re  going to get 
back there as fast as we can , because that ’s what we can do , but society more broadly can affect 
these things .  You know, we don’ t really have tools that can address distributional, disparate 
outcomes as well as fiscal policy .  And just policy general ly—education, health care, all those 
things are much better at doing that.  
In terms of—so we do—you will see that —you will see that discussed —the B lack 
unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do.  And I think we clearly understand now that it’ s something to weigh when you get a tight labor market .  It’s something that you want to 
be focused on and weigh.  So it is very much in our thinking —again, in a world where we don’ t 
really have the best tools to address that .  So, something that we ’re doing.  
So I have not seen that —I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it 
to me .  We, of course , have been in meetings until just before this .  So, but —and I will take a 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 29 
 look at it .  I will do that.  And, you know, I —without having had a  chance to think about it, read 
it, understand it, I ’ll just say a couple things .  First, I think it’ s fair to acknowledge that there ’s 
been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the 
workplace —not just among econom ists, but among economists and at the Fed .  That ’s been 
going on for far too long .  And , you know, like every other organization, the Fed  could have 
done more and—and should have done more . 
I would say,  though, that we —you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as 
diverse and inclusive an organization as we can .  And I think we ’ve made a lot of progress on 
that.  I think we want a place where it ’s free to speak, where views are welcome, where people 
can disagree but must do so respectfully.  I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that .  And I —my experience has been, you know, from my 
career in business too, is that organizations —the really successful organizations in our society 
get this .  They do.  Th ey—mostly , they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is 
what you—you’ re going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce , 
so—and workplace .  So we ’ve made diversity a priority . 
We actually —you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession .  We had 
the—the  two heads of the AEA task force on this —who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and 
Janet Yellen —come here, and I cohosted  a—an event with them , I guess , last year or the year 
before , which had several hundred— 500 people or something like that listening in about —about  
these issues.  So we ’re doing a lot .  I’m sure we can do  more .  We’re doing a lot to— you know, 
to foster a respectful climate—particularly for women , but for —for  all people .  So it ’s—it’s  a 
very high priority for us as an organization.  I will look into —into that and —when I —you know, 
when this is over.

Page 23 of 29 
 MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay, thank you.  Don Lee . 
DON LEE .  Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and 
new hi ring activity has weakened .  I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate 
rising and job growth turning negative this summer?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we ’re watching this high -
frequency data .  And , of course , the offi cial labor market reports come out once a month , and no 
one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they’ re going to say.  They ’ve been, in 
May and June , stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May.  So I would say,  some 
humility is ap propriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going.  I 
think all we can say today is that there ’s—there’s  evidence in the high -frequency data, the 
surveys , and , you know, you’ re tracking —you get pictures of spending.  You get pic tures of 
people ’s movements .  And what we —it looks like we ’re seeing a slowdown in the rate of 
growth.  That’s —and that might be —it might be  short  lived, it might not be, you know .  And it 
seems to be related to —and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in 
the middle of June . 
Now, I really don’ t want to get ahead of where the data are on this.  So we ’re just going 
to have to see .  We’re going to have to—the data over the next couple of months will answer that 
question.  And r ecent experience suggests we— we need to wait and see .  In any case, there ’s 
clearly a risk that we ’re going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and 
in hiring.  It might still be at a robust level.  Honestly, we —we will not know unt il we start to see 
more data come in.

 VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida  with Politico .  Thanks for taking my questio n.  
I wanted to ask about the 13( 3) facilities .  You all have used your emergency authority to buy 
assets that you can ’t directly  buy, like corporate bonds, ETF s.  So I was just wondering, what is 
the scope of your authority under 13( 3)?  What type of assets are you allowed to buy?  Could 
you buy equities through an SPV , for example?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, we haven’ t—we haven’t  looked at that , and we have 
no—no intention .  We haven ’t done any work or thought about buying equities .  But , you know, 
we—we ’re bound by the —by the  provisions of 13( 3), which requires that we make, you know, 
facilities —programs or  facilities of  broad applicability, m eaning we have to have —it can ’t just 
be focused on one entity.  You know, it has to be a broad group of entities . 
There ’s a lot in 13( 3) about —about  the solvency of the borrowers .  You know, 
remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that 
was—that was to —meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions .  That’s —
there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent  and 
things like that .  So, you know, we have to meet those requirements.  You know, we haven’ t 
looked and said —tried to say , “W hat can we buy ?” and, you know, “ Let’s make a complete list .”  
You know, we felt that , using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and—and 
municipal bonds , too.  So — 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  So I just— sorry, just to follow up really quickly.  So is it— is it 
generally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments , since you talked about 
borrowers?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The statute doesn ’t say that, but , yeah, you could read the statute that 
way if you want .  Honestly, we haven’ t tried to push it to, you know, what ’s the theoretical limit 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 29 
 of it.  I mean, I think, clearly , it’s—it’s  supposed to—it’s supposed to replace lending, you know .  
That’s—that’s  really what you ’re doing.  You ’re stepping in to provide credit at times when the 
market has stopped functioning.  That ’s fundamentally what you’ re doing with 13( 3).  And —and 
so I think you’ ve got to —you’ve got to sort of work within that framework. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Greg Rob b. 
GREG ROBB.  Hi .  Thanks for taking my question.  Greg Robb from Market Watch .  Can 
you hear me?  Okay.  One of the things in this crisis that ’s unusual is that companies are cuttin g 
wages and salaries, and that ’s something, you know, we haven’ t seen much .  And I was 
wondering what the Fed is thinking about this .  It—it  seems to indicate that inflation could be 
more volatile in coming—coming months and coming years. 
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I— I think that the main thing that tells you is that the —the 
labor market has a long way to go to recover .  You know, we had a good labor market .  It wasn ’t 
perfect .  There were always issues.  There are always going to be issues within an economy .  Bu t 
the labor market really has a long way to go now .  Even with two very strong months of job 
creation —7½ million jobs between the two months —we still have 14 million people 
unemployed .  So it ’s just —it’ s a long way to go.  And as—and that leads to a situation where 
there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened.  So 
there aren ’t, you know —until the economy—or as the economy fully reopens, people can  go 
back to work, but —so it’s a tough situation.  
And I’ve re ad reports of that .  You know, of course , the reported wages went up because 
of the composition effect —you know, it’s low -paid workers didn’ t go back to work, so—they 
were the ones that got laid off —so average hourly earnings went up.  But clearly, clearly  the 
pressure—there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 29 
 level here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work .  And the 
main —so it just underscores again the —the  urgency of doing everythi ng we can to restore the 
labor force and—and to support those who are —who want to be in the labor force but whose 
jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Jean Y ung. 
JEAN YUNG .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you very much.  I wanted to ask about forward 
guidance .  Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes?  And would 
you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes?  A nd 
specifically , for the labor market , what conditions would you want to see before you think about 
pulling back stimulus ?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So that ’s a great discussion that  we—we ’ve talked about that at past 
meetings, and I imagine we will at fu ture meetings and haven ’t made any decisions yet on that .  
But, you know, you’ ve got a couple ways to go.  You can tie —you can tie them to dates .  You 
can say we will —for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level.  Or you can say 
we’ll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal .  And it can either be 
inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out . 
And I think that, you know, there ’s attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I 
think, for obvious reasons.  You can imagine situations where, you know, where you’ d really 
want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes .  It’s also the case, though, that sometimes—
sometimes date -based guidance works too .  I think it really is very fact  specific, and it ’s not 
something we ’ve—you know, we haven’ t made any decisions on that, so I wouldn’ t be standing 
here telling you we ’re going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us 
to—to change our forward guidance.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 29 
 MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Ha nnah. 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Thanks for doing this today.  I wanted to ask, on 
the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they ’ve said that they’ re weighing 
whether to revise the Collins A mendment  in order to ease the tier 1 lever age ratio for banks .  Are 
you concerned that doing so will deplete bank  capital, given that the Fed ’s stress test s showed 
that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery , that several banks would approach 
the regulatory minimum capital  requirem ents? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So—okay.  So I think what the stress tests  showed is that , under the 
“regular way”  stress test, the banks passed .  But right in the middle of the —of the  stress test 
came the pandemic.  And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios , which were, you know, 
really bad scenarios.  And many of the banks passed, but some didn’ t.  So we —and that was 
done very quickly.  S o we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can —that says there ’s 
been a material change, and we ’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans .  We also 
stopped buybacks —share buybacks and limited dividends .  So we ’re working through the details 
of how all of that will work .  I think we ’re going to—I think we’re going to  send out the —the  
stress scenarios on S eptember  30th .  So, I would say, that ’s—you know, that —that  process is 
working that way. 
And—but you’ re making a connection to it, to the Collins A mendment  fix.  So what ’s 
going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we 
found is that our —we have found our banks are strong.  They ’re strongly capitalized , with lots of 
liquidity .  And they’ ve really been a source of strength in this —in this  crisis so far .  And they’ ve 
written off bad loans and things like that .  The y’re still well capitalized and strong and will be , I 
think, a source of strength in this situation.  
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 29 
 So—but what —what  we did earlier was , we—what happens is , the banks run up against 
their leverage ratio, which is a non- risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the 
balance sheet .  So people put cash in—on deposit at the banks , and they reached the limit of 
how—how  much they could grow or made loans —you know, they—companies drew down 
loans and deposited cash .  So we gave some leverage ratio reli ef earlier by temporarily —it’ s 
temporary relief —by eliminating, temporarily , Treasuries from the  calculation of the —of the  
leverage ratio .  This is  a—this is  another additional thing to do .  If Congress chooses to do this, 
we would want it to be explicitly  temporary .  We —in other words, this will not be a permanent 
change in capital standards . 
We haven ’t decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their 
balance sheet and , in doing so, to serve their customers better .  And , you know, I have to tell 
you, if you look around the world, bank regulators —many, many bank regulators around the 
world have given leverage ratio relief .  You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the 
European Commission did, the Bank of Canada di d, we did.  It’s—it’s not, it’s not —what it ’s 
doing is , it’s allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers .  
That—that ’s really what it’ s doing.  And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if —if 
we do do it.  
MIC HELLE SMITH .  Okay, thank you.  We’ll go to Brian Ch eung for the last question. 
BRIAN CH EUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell .  Thanks so much.  Brian Ch eung with Yahoo 
Finance .  I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your 
discussion on explicit forward guidance .  So is the idea that you’ re trying to have some order to 
that, that you would announce the findings of the Fed  review before then committing to some 
sort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy?   Thanks . 
July 29, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 29 
 CHAIR POWELL .  You know, so I do think that completion of the review would—first 
of all, it ’s something that was a very high priority  for—we were really looking forward to 
completing it , probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that .  We 
were right on track, and then we got distracted.  I —and we weren ’t expecting the pandemic, of 
course .  Nobody was .  So the pandemic came in .  I think it is important to go back and f inish 
that, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward.  
I would also tell you, though, that , to—to a very large extent , the—the  changes we ’ll 
make to the S tatement of [on]  Longer -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy are rea lly 
codifying the way we ’re already acting with our policies .  To a large extent, we’ re already doing 
the things that are —that are  in there .  This is just a way of —of acknowledging that and putting 
them in the document .  I can ’t tell you what the exact tim ing of that will be, but I do think that ’s 
a—that’s a sensible way to think about it .  Thanks very much. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
September 16, 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and 
price stability.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide 
some relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit 
lasting damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I made some important changes to our policy statement, including an update to our guidance for the likely path of our policy interest rate.  Guided by our new Statement on Longer -Run 
Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that we announced a f ew weeks ago, these changes clarify 
our strong commitment over a longer time horizon.  Before describing today’s policy actions, let me briefly review recent economic developments.  
Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second- quarter level, wh en much of 
the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus.  With the reopening of many 
businesses and factories and fewer people withdrawing from social interactions, household 
spending looks to have recovered about three -quarters of its earlier decline.  Nonetheless, 
spending on services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality, is still quite weak.  The recovery in household spending also likely owes to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment  benefits, which provided substantial and timely 
support to household incomes.  Activity in the housing sector has returned to its level at the beginning of the year, and we are starting to see signs of an improvement in business investment.  The recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our June Summary of 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 32 
 Economic Projections.  Even so, overall activity remains well below its level before the 
pandemic and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.  
In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April 
have been regained as many people returned to work.  The unemployment rate declined over the past four months but remains elevated at 8.4 percent as of August.  Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the med ian 
projection is 7.6 percent at the end of this year, 5.5 percent next year, and 4 percent by 2023. 
The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to 
shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the services sector, for women, and for African 
Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great 
uncertainty about the future.  
The pandemic  has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  For some goods, including 
food, supply constraints have led to notably higher prices, adding to the burden for those struggling with lost income.  More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer -run objective.  The median inflation projection from 
FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.7 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023. 
As the economy began its recovery, COVID -19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths also 
rose.  The reimposition of some social -distancing restrictions as well as more cautious behavior 
by many individuals have  succeeded in slowing the spread of the virus.  As we have emphasized 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 32 
 throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will 
depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.  All of us have a role to pl ay in 
our nation’s response to the pandemic.  Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.  A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.  
The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken across all parts of the 
government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed.  The Fede ral 
Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  We remain committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. 
The changes we made in today’s policy statement reflect our strategy to achieve our dual -
mandate goals by seeking to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment and achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as we articulated in our Statement on Longer -Run 
Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  We view maximum employment as a broad -based and 
inclusive goal and do not see a high level of employment as posing a policy concern unle ss 
accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.  And we believe that achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time helps ensure that longer -term inflation exp ectations remain well anchored at 
our longer -run 2 percent objective.  In turn, well -anchored inflation expectations enhance our 
ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives, particularly in the new normal in which interest rates are closer to their effective lower bound even in good times. 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 32 
 Hence, as we say in our statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, 
we “will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation 
averages 2 percent over  time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 
2 percent. ”  We expect “ to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these 
outcomes ”—including maximum employment —“are achieved. ”  With regard to interest rates, 
we now in dicate that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent 
target range for the federal funds rate “ until labor market conditions have reached levels 
consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation h as risen to 
2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. ” 
In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our “ holdings of Treasury 
securities and agency mortgage -backed securities at least at the current pace. ”  The se asset 
purchases are intended “to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative 
financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.”  
We believe the strong policy guidance we are providing today will  serve the economy 
well by promoting our goals through the many possible paths the recovery may take.  Of course, 
as we note in our policy statement, we “ would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary 
policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could im pede the attainment of our [the Committee’s] 
goals.”  
The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly 
support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for state and local gove rnments.  Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating the damage 
to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.  Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 32 
 very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs serve as a 
backstop to key credit markets and appear to have restored the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.  We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, 
enabled , in large part , by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  When 
the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox.  
As I have emphasized befo re, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed 
cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will 
be repaid.  Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials hav e the power to tax and spend and 
to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The 
fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, 
businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.  
We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the 
country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.

 Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the passing of our friend and 
colleague, Thomas Laubach.  His outstanding analysis and advice have been indispensable to the 
FOMC and have played a key role in the policy decisions that will define this era of the Federal 
Reserve.  He will be remembered for his intellect, but also his kindness, his equanimity, and his dedication to achieving our mission on behalf of the American people.  We will miss him.  Thank you.  I ’ll now be glad to take your questions. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos . 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Good afternoon , Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street 
Journal .  Yo u’ve been very clear about the C ommittee ’s intention on rates, not even thinking 
about thinking about raising rates , and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls  to 4 
percent  and inflation rises to 2  percent .  My question is about asset purcha ses.  Does the 
guidance today apply t o the current asset purchase pace ?  Are there any macroeconomic 
conditions under which you would favor increasing the  monthly pace of Treasury and MB S 
purchases?  And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthl y pace of purchases be 
appropriate?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So we say in our postmeeting statement that we’ ll 
continue to increase our securities holdings “ at least at the current pace”  over coming months “ to 
sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.”   That 
latter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I ’ve been saying in these press 
conferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases ar e fostering accommodative  financial conditions as well.  That amounts to roughly 
$80 billion a month of T reasuries and $40 billion net per month for MB S. 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 32 
 So we do —we do  think that these purchases have been effective in , in restoring  orderly 
market conditions and have supported the flow of credit to households and businesses, including 
by fostering more accommodative financial conditions , which , of course , we think is a good 
thing.  So , in terms of going forward, I would just say this :  There  are various ways an d margins 
that we can adjust our  tools going forward, and we ’ll continue to monitor developments.  And 
we’re prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could—if I could  follow up, I suppose the question I have is, 
why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on the other policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we, we think our —we think our  policy stance is appropriate 
today, and we ’re prepar ed to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate.  And today we 
believe that particularly this very strong forward guidance —very powerful forward guidance that 
we’ve announced today will provide strong support for the economy.  Effectively , we’re saying 
that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that  should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity.  
Now we ’re buying $120 billion in securities per month across the —across the  Treasury 
curve.  That ’s also adding to accommodation.  We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and, 
and the  rate tool and, and  other tools as well.  But as for right now, we think—we think  that our 
policy setting is appropriate to support the ex pansion.  We  did—we  said from the beginning that 
we would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, a nd then we would support the expansion when it came.  Well, it ’s here.  And 
it’s well a long.  And so that ’s why we changed our guidance today, and we do have the 
flexibility to do more when we think it ’s appropriate.

 NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.   Thanks for t aking my question.  Jeanna 
Smiale k, New York Times.  I was wondering, you beefed up your language on financial stability 
in the long- run statement  that you unveiled with your Jackson Hole speech last month.  I ’m 
wondering if you could kind of walk us through how you think about financial stability concerns as a factor in guiding and interpreting increases.  You know, would financial stability concerns 
on their own be enough to merit changes in the f ed funds rate?  Or would they have to come in 
conjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate?  If you could, sort of , give us an outline of your thinking there, please. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So what we said in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals and 
Monetar y Policy Strategy was that the C ommittee ’s policy decisions reflect “ its longer -run goals, 
its medium -term outlook, and its assessment [s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the 
financial system that coul d impede the at tainment of the C ommittee ’s goals.”   So that ’s what we 
said about financial stability.  And today we said that we ’d “be prepared to adjust the stance of 
monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the 
Committee’s ] goals.”  
But you asked specifically about , about  financial stability.  One thing I would say is that 
financial —that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense —is not the first line of 
defense on financial stability.   We look to more appropria te tools in the first instance as a first 
line of defense , and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity , stress 
testing —all of those things, macroprudential tools.  All of those things are, are really the first 
line of defense o n financial stability.  But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 32 
 those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks , more broadly, that could impede the attainment of 
our goals in, in setting  monetary policy.  So that’s , that’s  really how we think about it , but 
principally that, you know, other tools are the —are the frontline , as I mentioned.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Just to follow up quickly, if, if other tools aren ’t forthcoming, 
would financial stability concerns in and of themselves  be enough to warrant a rate hike?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , you know, what we said again  in the [Statement on] L onger -Run 
[Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy] —you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you 
know —“policy decisions reflect … the balance of ri sks, including risks to the financial system 
that coul d impede the attainment of the C ommittee ’s goals.”   So the test would be, you know, 
does a majority of the C ommittee feel that , that  monetary policy is , is triggering that?  And that , 
that would be —that  would be  the test.  And , you know, it ’s not something that we ’ve done.  We 
do monitor financial stability concerns , of course , intensely and regularly.  We try to use our 
other tools on them, but we , we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman . 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me unde rstand how the 
projections of the C ommittee  line up with the goals of the C ommittee.  You’ve now altered the 
projections to—the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent .  But when I look at the SEP, I 
don’t see the C ommittee believing  a single year in the next four years that you are ever above 
2 percent .  In fact, for each year, you are below it until 2023, which is the first time that you 
actually hit 2  percent .  So do you think—are, are you confident —is this just the C ommittee is not 
confident that not only can it not hit its 2  percent  goal, but that now it can ’t hit its goal of being 
above 2 percent ? 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 32 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Not at all.  And, you know, you don’t —you also don ’t see people , by 
and large , lifting off or raising interest rates above zero.  I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a 
Committee o f 17 during that —during the forecast period .  So we don’ t reach 2  percent , but we 
get very close to it in the forecast.  We reach 2  percent —I guess the median is 2  percent  at the 
end of 2023.  So , you know, you know what the guidance says.  It says that we expect that the 
current setting of , of our r ates will be—what we  expect  [is] that it will be appropriate until such 
time as we reach 2  percent  inflation , that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with 
our assessment of maximum employment, and that we ’re on track to achieve inflation 
moderate —inflation moderately above.   So that ’s the test.   So I don’ t think there ’s any conflict 
between those two because, you know, the , the way they’re set up, the  projections don’ t show the 
out years.  
You asked about confidence, and I would say that thi s, this  very strong, very powerful 
guidance shows both our confidence and our determination.  It shows our confidence that we can 
reach this goal and our determination to do so.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  I ’m sorry, if I could just follow up without  being simplistic about 
this.  But why wouldn’t —if the C ommittee was confident that it could reach its new goal of 
aiming for inflation above 2 percent , why wouldn’ t one of those years at least show inflation 
being above 2 percent  on the median forecast? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Because it —we think, looking at everything we know about inflation 
dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take 
some time.  We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow 
as, as people go back to work.  And we ’ll still have an area of the economy —a big area of the 
economy—that struggles.  There will be slack in the economy.  The economy will be below 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 32 
 maximum employment, below full demand.  And that will tend to wear —to put downward 
pressure on inflation.  So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think 
that inflation will come back , generally.  And , I mean, that ’s sort of what happened during the 
last long expansion.  It ’s a slow process, but —but  there is a process there.   Inflation does move 
up over time.  We do expect that will continue today, a nd we expect that our , our guidance is 
powerful and will help that outcome.  We think that —that  effectively saying that policy will 
remain highly accommodative unt il the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide 
strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel . 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  I 
wanted to ask if you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is not another 
stimulus package  and, specifically, if there are particular holes still remaining in the economy 
that you think could be helped by more aid from Congress.  Thanks very much. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sur e.  So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic P rojections 
that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you’ ll see is an expectation that the recovery 
will continue —that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, ’ 22, and ’ 23.  We do 
expect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace w ould be fastest 
right at the beginning of the —right at the beginning of the recovery, because  you had such a 
sharp decline.  You would expect that the third quarter should be  the fastest gains, and that , after 
that, the pace should slow down to a more norm al pace.  So we do expect that.  
In terms of fiscal policy —you asked about fiscal policy.  So , you know, one thing— I 
guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid.   It was 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 32 
 forceful and pretty effective.  And we ’re seeing the results of that in —today in income and 
household spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for 
business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and , you 
know, the pace of de fault and things like that has really slowed.  So there ’s been a really 
positive  effect.  
That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed.   Of course, the 
details of that  are for Congress, not for the F ed.  But I would just say, there  are still roughly 
11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were 
working in industries that are likely to struggle.  Those people may need additional , additional  
support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them.  We’ve also 
got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public.  And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time 
spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects.  So , again, I 
would say, the fiscal support has been essential in , in the good progress we see now. 
And, finally, I’ ll note that just about all— the overwhelming majority of , of private 
forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial 
additional fiscal support.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Mike Derby.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  [Inaudible] t aking my question.  Should we e xpect any further 
evolutions in forward guidance, say , maybe an adoption of something akin to the Evans r ule that  
we had a few years ago?  Or is  there something else that the F ed might be considering in the 
future?  
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 32 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, s o we think that the  forward guidance we adopted today is 
appropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful.  Effectively, what it says is that we’ll, we will  keep 
policy where it is now —keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the 
Committee ’s assessments or levels that are—sorry, not unemployment , labor market conditions 
reach levels that are consistent with the Committee ’s assessments of maximum employment , 
until inflation reaches 2  percent , and until it ’s on track to go above 2 percent  moderately for 
some time.   So that ’s very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable 
guidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years.  So that ’s, that’s  
really our thinking on, on  forward guidance on rate s. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider . 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this.  So to follow  
up on Mike ’s question there , since you described this guidance as durable, you—you’ve  set up a 
three -part test here for rate h ikes:  levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment, 
inflation has risen to 2  percent,  and you’ re on track to moderately exceed 2 percent  for some 
time.  Each of these have modifiers, and I wonder if you could explain them a little bit more.  
How do we pin down assessments of maximum employment?   When you say that “ inflation has 
risen to 2  percent ,” does that mean 2  percent  for a day, a month, six months?   And when you say 
“on track to moderately exceed,”  how should we define “ moderately ”?  And how should we 
define “ for some time ”? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, maximum employment is not —is not  something 
that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can.  It’s a broad range of factors.  It really always has been and , really , a substantial number of factors that we’ve indicated we would look 
at.  So it’s broader labor conditions , consistent with our Committee’s assessment of maximum 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 32 
 employment.  So that would certainly mean low unemployment , it would mean high labor force 
participation , it would mean wages —it would be a whole range of things .  And we ’re not looking 
at a rule.  We ’re looking at a judgmental assessment , which I think we ’ll be very transparent 
about as we —as we go forward.  
In terms of inflation, you know, this is a C ommittee that is both confident and committed 
to—and determined to reach our goals.  And the idea that we would look for the , the quickest 
way out is just —it’s just  not who we are.  It’s not that—t here’s no message of that here.  We 
would not be looking for one month of 2 percent  inflation ; we said return to 2—to achieve 
2 percent  inflation.  Okay .  So just understand that, you know, we ’re strongly committed to 
achieving our goals and the overshoot.  So that should tell you about that.  
Oh, in terms of —okay, in terms of —so, what does “ moderate ” mean?  It means not large.   
It doesn’t —it means not very high above 2 percent .  It means moderate.  I think that’ s a fairly 
well-understood word.  In terms of —in terms of  “for a time, ” what it means is not permanently 
and not for a sustained period.  You know, we ’re, we’re  resisting the urge to try to create some 
sort of a rule or a formula here.  And I think the, the public  will understand pretty well what we 
want.  It’ s actually prett y straightforward.  We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent  
over time.  And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that ’ll help us 
achieve 2  percent  inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its 
ability to support the economy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi . 
JAMES POLITI.  Thanks for taking the question.  James Politi with the Financial Times .  
Do you consider today’ s enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the —to 
the U.S. economy from a monetary perspective  and sort of deliver further support  for the 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 32 
 economy?   Or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance?  And , in terms of fiscal support, 
do you assume in your own projections —not just , you know, private forecasters—that additional 
fiscal support will be forthcoming?  Or do you expect weaker  growth or a —or a  larger 
contraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , in terms of the effects, so  I think what we’ve done  is—is more or 
less aligned with the consensus statement today.  So it ’s, it’s in line with what , what  might have 
been expected.  As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this 
economy as we move forward.  In a sense, it ’s consistent with expectations, so I don ’t—I’m not 
looking for a big reaction right now.  But I think , over time, again, guidance that we expect to 
retain the current stance until the economy  is—has moved very far toward our goals is a strong 
and powerful t hing.  And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time.  
In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if —
yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made 
different assessments on their own.   I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among 
private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action.   
And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something.  The question is, how much and when?  
And so I would just say that if —and it ’s very hard to say.  So , so far the economy has 
proven resilient to the —to the  lapsing of the —to the, of the  CARES Act unemployment —
enhanced unemployment benefits.  But there ’s, there’s  certainly a risk , though, that , that  those 
who are unemployed have saved—appear to have saved some of those benefits, a nd they ’ll, 
they’ll  now spend them , and that , as the months pass, if , if there ’s no follow -up on that, if there 
isn’t additional support and there isn ’t a job for the —some of those people who are, are  from 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 32 
 industries where , where  it’s going to be very hard to find new work, then you’ll —that will start 
to show up in economic activity.  It’ll also show up in things like evictions and foreclosures and, 
and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy.  So that ’s a downside risk.  
So I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the —what will 
be the  contents ?  And , you know, no one —no one  has any certainty around that, but , broadly 
speaking, if we don’ t get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the —
certainly through the channel I mentioned. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Anneken, CNN.  
ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chair man Powell, given the recent 
update to the policy framework and repeated calls for this in the Fed Listens  events, is the F ed 
open to other measures of the  economy, such as income inequality and affordability of housing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we —you know, we monitor everything we think is important in 
the U.S. economy.  And  in that —in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary 
policy.  You mentioned inequality.  So , you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well -
being by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully.  
Inequality, which I would point to— it’s a multifaceted thing.   But I would point to the relative 
stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility.   So those are things that hold back our economy.  They are.  
The thing is, we don’ t really have the tools to address those.  We, we have interest rates 
and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that , but we can’t —we can’t  
get at those things through our tools.  When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the 
economy across a broad range of , of people and activities, but we can’t —we don’ t have the 
ability to target particular groups.  
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 32 
 Notwithstanding that, we , we do talk about it , because these are important features of our 
economy.  And we —you know, I , I think those are—those distributional issue s are, are  issues 
that are really for our elected officials.  And I would say, I take them seriously as holding back 
our economy.  The productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has the educational background and , and the health  care and all the things that you 
need to be an active participant in our workforce.  So I think we can—if we want to have the , the 
highest potential output and the —and the  best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to 
be very broadly spread in the longer run. 
And I—again, I would just say, the F ed—you know, we can talk about those things a lot.  
And in, in—when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual 
groups.  So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans  when —you 
know, we would look at that as we think about whether we ’re really at maximum employment.  
We would look—we would look at that along with a lot of other data.  So the answer is, we do 
look at all those things and, and do what we can with our tools.  But , ultimately, these are issues 
for elected representatives.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Ye s, thank you, Chairma n Powell, for the question.  I just 
wanted some clarity here.   At what point do you think it’ s prudent to shift the bond purchases 
from market stability —as you had said, from the shorter -term maturities to more longer- term, 
more stimulus -related? 
CHAIR POW ELL.  So , you know, we think our —we think that our asset purchases are 
doing both the thing—both  those things today.  We think, clearly , there ’s been great progress , in 
terms of market function.  If you remember , early in the spring when the acute phase of  the 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 32 
 pandemic hit, market function was very low.  And it ’s improved rapidly and, and in many 
respects is , is in a good place now.  We also , though, think that these asset purchases, which total 
$120 billion a month—you know, which is much larger than, for example , the last asset purchase 
program during the G lobal F inancial Crisis and the recovery therefrom —we think that that ’s also 
providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth.  And we think that ’s fine.  
We’re also aware that we, we —there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do 
various things —you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of 
the—of the  curve.  And , you know, we ’re, we’re  going to continue to monitor developments, and 
we’re prepared  to adjust our plans as appropriate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria.  Vi ctoria Guida . 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about a couple 
of things.  First of all, if we don ’t get a vaccine until well into next year,  what does that mean for 
the economy?   And then, somewhat related, I was wondering if you could provide any more 
detail about the stress scenarios that you all are going to release for the big banks and whether 
that is going to be another full -blown stress  test, whether we ’re going to publicly see those 
results, and what it might mean for bank payouts.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Great.   So, on the first one , what’s happening is basically we ’re 
learning to live with —right now , we're learning to live with COVID , which st ill spreads.  And 
we’re learning to , to engage in economic activity.   All of this recovery that we ’ve seen is in a 
context where —you know, where people are still at risk of , of catching it , and yet we ’re able to 
resume lots and lots of economic activities.   And that involves, as I mentioned, you know —I 
think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce —wearing 
masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing—the better we’ ll be able to get economic activity 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 32 
 back up close to whe re it was.   I do think, though, there are areas of the economy that are just 
going to really struggle until we have an —a vaccine that ’s, that’s  in wide —you know, wide 
usage and is , is widely trusted.  And those are the ones where  people were  getting really 
closely —close together.  
I also think testing —to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with 
that in the workforce.  You can—you can build confidence in the workforce if you have 
regular —very regular testing that doesn’ t cost very much and you get the results really quickly.  
If you do that, you’ ll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall 
case numbers are quite low.   And that will help a lot.  
So I think we ’re, we’re going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards —you 
know, as far as we can.  There ’s always going to be that —for, for  some time, there’ s going to be 
certain activities that will be —that will be  hard to, to resume.   So I , I think that ’s the only way I 
can say it .  And I think trying to—you know, we all —when we make a forecast, we make 
assessments about that , but it’s really hard to say.  There is no template here.  There ’s no—you 
know, there’s no experience with this.  
So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy’ s recovered faster than expected.  
And that may continue or not.  We just don’ t know.  And I think we should do those things that 
we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible.  And the  main thing, again, is 
wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you’ re in the workforce.  That ’s something we 
can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks , and 
things like that.  
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 32 
 In, in terms of the str ess test s, so I really don ’t have any—you know, we ’re getting ready 
quite soon to be making announcements and saying things publicly.  There ’s not much I can say 
with you—nothing, really, that I can say that’s —on that today.  I don’ t have anything for you. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Chris Condon . 
CHRIS TOPHER CONDON.  Thank you, Michelle.  Good afternoon, Chair man Powell.  
You have emphasized many times, including today, that the Fed can only lend and not spend, 
and sometimes the latter is what ’s really needed.   But to the extent that a $600 billion lending 
program for small and midsize companies could help, what exactly is wrong with the design or function of the Main Street Lending P rogram , which has purchase d just , I think , $1.4 billion in 
loans so far? 
Eric Rosengren at the  Boston Fed has said recently that Congress should clarify how 
much risk it wants the program to take.  But Congress has already appropriat ed substantial funds 
for the 13( 3) programs , and these are funds that are explicitly designed to absorb losses.  
Meanwhile, my colleagues who cover the banking sector say they ’re being told by commercial 
banks that the Treasury Department is advising them to target zero losses —zero losses in Main 
Street P rogram loans.  So , if I may, why is it that th e Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the 
Treasury apparently cannot agree on a loss tolerance that should  be applied to the Main Street 
Lending P rogram in a way that would allow badly needed credit to reach these companies?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So , a couple things about Main Street.  It , it reaches the whole 
nation.  It’s got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are 
part of it, a nd it’s making loans.  The number is more like —it’s close to $2 billion now.  So the 
numbers are going up.  Banks are joining;  borrowers are coming.  And it ’s significant.  It’s , it’s 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 32 
 relatively small now, but it can scale up in response to economic conditions, should that be —
should that be  appropriate.  You know, if you look out in the lending world, surveys generally 
find that , that  firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem.   And that , that  is a lot of 
PPP, bank credit lines , and syndicated loans.  There ’s a lot of credit being let out the re. 
So—but you’ re right.  We , we are looking at some things.  We ’re looking at —some 
lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations.  So banks are going to—their 
approach is likely to be that they ’re going to underwrite this loan roughly the same  as they 
underwrite any loan.  They ’re keeping part of it, and, you know, what , what  we want to do is 
make sure that —that  they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in , 
in place, and also that —you know, it ’s, it’s really —it’s re ally a, a facility for , for companies or 
borrowers that, that  don’ t have access to , to “ regular way ” borrowing now.  Otherwise, why 
would we need Main Street? 
So that ’s what we're working on.  And we ’ll be doing some , some —we ’ll be making 
some changes in that respect.  I don’t —I saw what President Rosengren said.   I, I can’t really 
comment directly on that.  I just woul d say that, you know, this is 13( 3).  If you look at the law 
under section 13(3), it’s very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers.  And , 
and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of , of section 13(3) in effect, 
including the requirement  that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent.  
This was —this la w was amended  in, you know , under —in Dodd- Frank, and the idea was, was  to 
make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans —at the time, the thinking 
was to banks.  
So now we —now we ’re using that same law for , for smaller business borrowers, and , 
you know, it doesn’t— it’s not a perfect fit.   And , and, I would also just say , for many borrowers, 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 32 
 they’ re in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down , and they won’ t be able to 
service a loan, and so  they may need more fiscal support.  Having said that, we’re , we’re  
continuing to work to , to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available —make it pretty 
much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan. 
CHRIS TOPHER CONDON.  And can you just very briefly address the reports that the 
Treasury is advising banks to target zero losses?  Is that appropriate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I can ’t say.  I don’t —I don’t  know about that.  I haven’ t heard those 
reports.  You know, again, if you think about it , we, we weren ’t—we’re , we’re  going to have to 
go through the banking system to do this.  We —we ’re not going to have a hundred thousand or a 
million loan off icers working for the F ed and the Treasury.  So we ’re going to go through the 
banking system , and the banks —banks  like to make good loans.  That ’s what they do.  They ’re 
trained to make good loans.  So you should expect that they— and we expect that they will do 
some underwriting.  We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the poi nt 
of it.  And the question is, how do you dial that in?   It’s, it’s not an easy thing to do.  And , you 
know, we ’re getting some loans made , and we ’re hopeful that we ’ll, that we’ll clarify this a nd 
that credit will continue to  flow.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber . 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Chair Powell, you’ ve 
talked a couple of times about parts of the economy that may not recover as fast as we ’ve seen so 
far.  Presumably you’ re referring to airlines, hotels, ot her sections—you know, parts of the 
economy that rely on close contact.  How are you thinking about that , in terms of its overall 
impact?  Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above —you know, far above 
your maximum goals?   Are you expecting that to come back with a vaccine?   Or are a lot of 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 32 
 those folks going to have to find, you know, new jobs in new indust ries?  And should we expect 
the F ed will keep rates at zero until all of that reallocation is done?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, we —of  course, we can’t be—we can’t be  really sure we know 
the answers to those questions.  But I would say, th e, the likely path is that the —that the  
expansion will continue.  And it’s , as I said, it’s well along, and it’ll move most easily through 
the parts o f the economy —it’ll still take some time , but the parts of the economy that weren’t 
exactly directly affected , that  didn’t involve getting people in large groups together to feed them, 
to fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that —those are going to 
be the places that are —that are  very challenging.  So there will also be  the—you know, the 
places that are affected that way.  And that ’s going to be challenging for , for some time.  It just 
is.  And we don’ t really know how long that will be.  
It’s—you know, it ’s millions of people.  As I mentioned, we had 11 million—something 
like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who 
went —who lost their jobs in March and April.  So that ’s half of the m.  So, 11 million —
particularly if the pace of , of returning to work slows down, it ’s going to leave a large —a large 
group of people.  And it ’ll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint.  And our 
commitment is not to forget those people.  As I mentioned, we want —you know, the sense of our 
forward guidance is that policy will remain , as we’ ve said , highly accommodative until the —
until the  expansion is well along—really , very close to our goals.  And even after , if we do lift 
off, we will keep pol icy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation 
for some time.  So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will  support the full 
recovery, including those people , as long as it takes.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Mike McKee.  
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 32 
 MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chair man, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and 
Television.  Based on what you were just saying about keeping policy accommodative for a very 
long time into the recovery, lower -for-longer as far out as three years in your latest  projections , is 
that basically it for the F ed?  In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things 
you can do would push down on interest rates.  But is it really —is it the case now that the only 
additional stimulus that can come to the e conomy is from the fiscal side?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, no, I wouldn’t —I certainly would not say that we ’re out of 
ammo .  Not at all.   So, first of all, we , we do have lots of tools.  We’ve got the lending tools , 
we’ve got the balance sheet, and we’ ve got further forward guidance —further forward guidance.  
So we, we —there ’s still plenty more that we can do.  We do think that our —that our, our  rate 
policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy.  We think it ’s powerful.  And , as I 
mentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over 
time, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well 
along—really , very close to our goals —and then will remain accommodative even aft er we lift 
off.  So I think that’s , that’s  a really strong place for , for rate policy to be.  But, again, we have 
the other margins that we can still use.  So , no.  C ertainly , we’re not out of ammo.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, if I could follow up, in terms of t he balance sheet, are you 
concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods -and-
services inflation?   In other words, are you risking a bubble on Wall Street?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very 
carefully.  These are—these are not new questions.  These were questions that were very much in 
the air a decade ago and more when , when the F ed first started doing QE.  And , I would say, if 
you look at the long experience of, you know, the 10- year, 8 -month expansion, the longest in our 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 32 
 recorded history, it included an awful lot of quantitative easing and low rates for 7 years.   And , I 
would say, it was notable for the lack of  the emergenc e of, of some sort of a financial bubble —a 
housing bubble or some kind of a bubble , the popping of which could threaten the expansion.  
That didn’ t happen.  And , frankly, it hasn’ t really happened around the world since then.  That 
doesn’ t mean that it won ’t happen, but —and so, of course , it’s something that we monitor 
carefully.  
After the financial crisis, we started a new —a whole division of the F ed to focus on 
financial stability.  We look at it in every—from  every perspective.  The F OMC gets briefed on a 
quarterly basis.  At the B oard here , we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis , so it is 
something we monitor.  But I don’ t know that the —that the  connection between asset purchases 
and, and financial stability is a particularly tight one.   So—but again, we won’t be —we won ’t be 
just assuming that.  We ’ll be checking carefully as we go.  And , by the way, the kinds of tools 
that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy.  It would be 
more tools that strengthen the  financial system.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Don Lee. 
DON LEE .  Chair  Powell, I ’d like to ask you about the labor market.  As you know, in 
August there were about 30 million persons claiming unemployment benefits.  Yet the BLS jobs report for August showed about 13½  million unemployed, only about 6 million more than before 
the pandemic.  I wonder how you reconcile that and what you think the actual labor market conditions are.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , I mean, I think the overall picture —take a step back from t his.  
The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it ’s a 
long way—a long way from maximum employment.  I think that’s , that’s  the bottom line on it.   
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 32 
 So, within that , though —take claims in particular.  The number of claims, the quantity of claims , 
and, frankly,  the fact that PUA claims are new —the P andemic U nemployment A ssistance 
claims—that ’s a new system that had to be set up.  The actual counting of the claims is , is 
volatile , and , and it ’s very difficult to take much signal about the particular level.  So , you know, 
because people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them 
all at once and things like that.  
I think , though, what you’ ve seen is that the l evel of —certainly the level of initial claims 
has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level —continues either to be flat or gradually decline.  It’s worth noting— and that ’s good—it’ s 
worth noting that tha t level is maybe five times the level of what claims were .  Claims were 
around 200,000; n ow they’ re 900,000, in that range , weekly for , for initial claims.  So that just 
tells you, the labor market has improved, but it ’s a long, long way from maximum employment , 
and it will be some time getting back there.  I think that ’s the best way to think about it.  In many 
parts of the economy there ’s just a lot of disruption, and it’s , it’s really hard to say precisely 
where we are.  
I’ll give you another example with— you know, we say unemployment ’s 8.4 percent.  B ut 
if you count those who are —who are  misidentified as, as  employed when they’ re actually 
unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number —so if you were —if you 
had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force.  But I—you know, I would—I 
would more look at those people as unemployed.  If you add those back, the level of 
unemployment ’s pro bably 3 percent  higher.  On the other hand, by that metric, the , the 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 32 
 unemployment rate would have  been in the —in the  20s in , in April.  So the improvement has 
been quite substantial under any measurement.  But the level is still quite high.  
DON LEE.  Well,  if I could follow up, i s—is it the F ed’s aim to get back to 3.5 percent  
or even lower?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, absolutely.  You know, I, I can’t be precise about a particular 
number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3 ½ percent  unemployment.  It’ s not a 
magic number.  No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum 
employment.  I would just say , you asked about 3 ½ percent .  A 3½ percent  unemployment rate 
showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the i ncome spectrum —in fact, going 
more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum.  It showed labor force participation coming up  
as—up above many estimates of its trend , as people who ’d been out of the labor force were 
being pulled into a tight job market.  There ’s a lot to like about a tough—a tight job market, 
particularly in a world where we didn ’t see inflation.   So, yes, we ’d love to get back to that.  
I mean, I would say, we would like to get back— rather than to a particular number, we ’d 
like to get back  to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find 
work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely.  That ’s what we ’d really love to get 
back to.  Now, of course we would—we need inflation to perform in line with , with  our 
framework.  But the good news is , we think we can have quite low unemployment without 
raising troubling inflation.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer . 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, I  want to follow up on the wealth gap issue.  I know you were —that you have limited 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 32 
 tools.  But are there things that you can do, possibly in the area of research and maybe expand 
your research on racial economic gaps?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we do—we are gifted with a , a subst antial group of 
researchers who  really cover the waterfront.  And we do a significant amount of research on 
racial disparities in —across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked  about.  So we do 
that.  And we also —remember , we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs , 
which is present in communities around the country.  And the R eserve B anks all have very active 
community a ffairs groups.  They ’re present in communities around the country.  So it wasn ’t just 
the Fed —Fed Listens  events.   It’s more , just , over a long period of time we, we are in contact 
with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy.  
We serve all Americans, and we know that.  And we ’re going to use our tools to , to 
reflect that fact.  So the answer is “ yes.”  We do quite a bit of research , and I suppose we could 
do more, but we really do a lot.  And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of , of 
the state of the economy.  And we do that not just becaus e it’s interesting and important, but 
because it ’s important for the economy and important for our mandate. 
We are assigned “ maximum employment.”   Now, what does that mean?  As I mentioned 
earlier, it doesn ’t mean a particular headline unemployment number.  What it means is maximum 
employment.  So , you know, we look at —look at  that in many, many different variables, and we 
ask ourselves whether those variables are—those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute max imum employment.  And that would include all of the 
things that we ’re talking about.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Greg Robb. 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 32 
 GREG ROBB.  Hi, Greg Rob b from MarketWatch.   Thanks for this.  I want to go back to 
the new forward guidance that you have.  And you said that it ’s powerful, but you’ve  already 
have two dissent —two dissenting voters on it.  And I was wondering if there ’s other , other  
people who argued against it.  And what do you say to the two who dissented?  It look s like 
President Kashkari  wanted  a simpler forward guidance, and President Kaplan thought that the 
current guidance you have was fine for now.  So , like , how did you argue back on those , on those  
arguments?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t—I don ’t want to comment particularly on, on the two 
dissenters, b ut they, they consent —they dissented from , of course , different perspectives, and, 
and that should be clear.  That’s their —they’re not—they ’re sort of on, on two sides of the , of 
the discussion.  But I would say this :  I am blessed wi th having a C ommittee of highly thoughtful 
people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and , of course , diverse views to 
our work.  And I wouldn’ t have it any other way.  I wouldn’ t.  So, so I would just say, the 
right —in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the 
Commi ttee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy 
Strategy and what ’s in there —very, very broad support , unanimous support for that.  Ever yone 
sees the, the  changes in the underlying economy and sees , in their own way, the need to address 
those —and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that 
we’re now  at flexible average inflation targeting.  
Of course, there would be —this is —you know, we ’re the first major central bank to 
adopt this framework.  There ’s no cookbook, and we —you know, this is the first guidance under 
our new framework.  So , of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect 
that.  And it ’s actually a healthy thing.  So I welcome that discussion.  I would also say this :  You 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 30 of 32 
 know, this is all about credibility , and we understand perfectly that we have to earn credibility.  
This, this  facility —this , this  framework has to —we hav e to support it with our actions.  And I 
think today is a very good first step in doing that.  
It is strong, powerful guidance.  It is—it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on ] 
Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy S trategy.  We had quite a robust discussion, and there 
are, there are different ideas on how to do this , but I—that ’s just , that’s just the way it is when 
you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people.  And so I ’m pleased with 
where it came out.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank  you.  Hannah Lang. 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks so much for taking my question.  I wanted 
to ask about commercial real estate.   I, I know you had mentioned before how you weren’t sure if 
there was a way the Fed  could support CRE borrowers.  But  I was just wondering if you had—if 
you’ve  had any other continuing discussions on that and if  there’s any potential way that the F ed 
could step in in that area.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So thank you for that question.  You know, we ’ve actually spent 
quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think , mentioned the other day.  And I ’ll say 
just a couple things.  First, you know, our facilities are essentially always —they have to be , 
under the law —broad based and not so much targeting any single sector.  Also, it’ s important to 
remember that CRE , commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities.  So 
the TALF takes commercial mortgage- backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals.  
And the New York F ed purchases agency CMBSs direc tly.  In addition, I would say,  Main Street 
helps businesses pay their rent, you know.  So we ’re, we’re  helping real estate, you know, in a 
number of other ways —commercial real estate.  
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 31 of 32 
 Also, CMBS issuance has resumed.  Spreads have tightened on CMBS.  Ther e are a 
couple of issues.  One is just that commercial properties with CMBS loans often have 
covenants —uniformly, I think , have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt.  So you 
have a situation, and you have a situation where , where you—without a l egal change or some 
kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you’re —you  have a hard time providing mass 
relief with regard to real estate that’ s in, in commercial mortgage- backed securities.  So we ’re 
still working on it.   We ’re still looking.   I would say, it may be that further support for 
commercial real estate will require further action for Congress —from Congress.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  For the last question, we ’ll go to Brian Cheung. 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.   So it seems like a lot of the new inflation 
framework is about shaping inflation expectations.   But the average American who might be 
watching this m ight be confused as to why the F ed is overshooting inflation.  So what ’s your 
explanation to Main Stre et, to average people what the F ed is trying to do here  and what the 
outcome would be for those on Main Street ?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s a very , very  important question, and I actually spoke about 
that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago.  It’ s not intuitive to people.   It is intuitive 
that, that  high inflation is a bad thing.   It’s less intuitive that inflation can be too low.  And the 
way I would explain it is , is that inflation that’ s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.  
There ’s an expectation of future i nflation that’ s built into every interest rate, right?  And to the 
extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get  lower and lower.  And then the 
Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy.  And this isn ’t some idle, you know, 
academic theory.  This is what ’s happening all over the world.  If you, if you look at many, many 
large jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon. 
September 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 32 of 32 
 So we want inflation to be —we want it to be 2  percent , and we want it to average  
2 percent .  So if inflation averages 2  percent , the public will expect that , and that ’ll be what ’s 
built into interest rates.   And that ’s just—that’s all we want.  So we ’re not looking to have high 
inflation.  We just want inflation to average 2  percent .  And that means that , you know, in a 
downturn, these days , what happens is , inflation, as has happened now —it moves down well 
below 2 percent .  And that means that we ’ve said for , for—we would like to see and we will 
conduct policies so that inflation moves , for some time , moderately above 2  percent .  So it won’t 
be—these won ’t be large overshoots , and they won’ t be permanent  but to help anchor inflation 
expectations at 2 percent .  So, yes, it ’s, it’s a challenging concept for a lot of people .  But, 
nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is  large.  And , you know, those are the people 
we’re  serving , and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2  percent  
inflation , we believe.   And that ’s why we changed our framework. 
MICHEL LE SMITH.  Thank you very much.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
November 5 , 2020  
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and 
price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide 
relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I reaffirmed our commitment to support the economy in this challenging time.  
Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second- quarter level.  The 
reopening of  the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an annual rate 
of 33 percent in the third quarter.  In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated.  Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been str ong and has 
moved above its pre -pandemic level.  In contrast, spending on services remains low, largely due 
to ongoing weakness in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.  The overall rebound in household spending owes , in part , to federal stimulus 
payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals.  The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interes t rates.  Business investment has also picked up.  Even so, overall 
economic activity remains well below its level before the pandemic , and the path ahead remains 
highly uncertain.  
In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April 
have been regained, as many people were able to return to work.  As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated.  The unemployment rate declined over the past five months but remained elevated a t 7.9 percent as of September.  
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 24  
 Although we welcome this progress, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who 
remain out of work.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the services sector, for women, 
and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great  uncertainty about the future.  
The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  Following large declines in 
the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer, in part reflecting a rise in durable goods prices.  However, for those sectors  that have been most affected by the pandemic, prices remain 
particularly soft.  Overall, on a 12- month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run 
objective.  
As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is 
extraor dinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on the success of efforts to keep the virus 
in check.  The recent rise in new COVID -19 cases, both here in the United States and abroad, is 
particularly concerning.  All of us have a role to play in our nati on’s response to the pandemic.  
Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.  A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it’ s safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.  
The Federal Reserve’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote 
maximum employment and stable prices for the American people , along with our responsibilities 
to promote the stability of the financial system.  As noted in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals 
and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad -based and inclusive 
goal. ”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends i mportantly on 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 24  
 having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.  As we said in September 
and again today, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve 
inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain 
an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect  that it will be appropriate to 
maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exc eed 2 percent 
for some time.  
In addition, over coming months we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury 
securities and agency mortgage -backed securities at least at t he current pace.  These asset 
purchases are intended to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  At this meeting, my colleagues and I discusse d our asset purchases and the role they are playing in 
supporting the recovery.  At the current pace, our holdings of securities are rising at a substantial rate of $120 billion per month—$80 billion per month of Treasuries and $40 billion per month of agency MBS.  We believe these purchases, along with the very large purchases made to preserve financial stability in the depths of the crisis, have materially eased financial conditions and are providing substantial support to the economy.  Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor developments and assess how our ongoing asset purchases can best support our maximum -
employment and price -stability objectives as well as market functioning and financial stability.  
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 24  
 The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad an d forceful actions to more directly 
support the flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for 
state and local governments.  Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to the economy and promoting a robust recovery.  Many of our programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the support of the Treasury D epartment and are available only in 
very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs serve as a backs top to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders 
through normal channels.  We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  When the time comes, after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the toolbox.  
As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed 
cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or facilities with broad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will 
be repaid.  Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.  But for many others , getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these 
cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective  resources.  The 
fiscal policy actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetimes.  It will take a w hile to get back to the levels of economic activity 
and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that. 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 24  
 I’d like to mention a couple of changes that we plan on making to our Summary of 
Economic Projections beginning in December.  First, we will release the entire package of SEP 
materials at the same time that the FOMC statement comes out.  Previously, some of these materials were released three weeks after the m eeting as part of the minutes.  This step will make 
more information available at the time of our policy announcements, including the distributions of forecasts and how participants judge the uncertainty and risks that attend their projections.  Second, we  will add two new graphs that show how the balance of participants’ assessments of 
uncertainty and risks have evolved over time.  These changes to the SEP will provide a timely perspective on the risks and uncertainties that surround the modal or baseline projections, thereby highlighting some of the risk- management considerations that are relevant for monetary 
policy.  
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service  to our public mission.  We are committed to 
using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  It’s Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  
Thanks very much for taking my question.  I’m wondering if you can speak specifically about 
what indicators you’ re seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has mod erated, including in 
the labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that we’ve seen going into flu season.  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, of course .  Let’s start with February.  In February, we had 
an eco nomy that was performing well.  Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 24  
 activity in March and April , and then we had a record bounceback in May and June.  And so as I 
think would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement fr om May and June 
has now moderated, so it ’s not unexpected.  And I think if you look at just about anything, you 
know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just 
outsized.  And they ’re certainly still very large, but they ’ve—but the pace of improvement has 
moderated.  That ’s the case for , for all different measures in the labor force —in the labor market, 
rather.  Another would be claims.  Just about all the data were—showed a big bounceback.  But 
then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people —a lot of people go back to work 
at once, the pace will moderate.  Same thing with economic activity.  Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the  33 percent annualized pace 
that we had in the third quarter.  So, in a sense, that would be —that would be as expected.  We 
have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are , are prevalent now, which are —which 
are really the risk of the further spre ad of the disease and also the risk that , that  households will 
run through the savings they ’ve managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could 
weigh on activity.  But what we see up to the present , really , is, continued growth, continued 
expansion, but at , at a gradually moderating pace.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press.  
MARTIN CRUTSINGER.  Thank you.  Could you talk a little bit about where you think 
the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is a nd how severe a threat that could be to 
the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So it is —obviously, it ’s for Congress to decide the timing , size , and 
components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we’ ve seen so far, which 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 24  
 has generally exceeded expectations.  And I do think it ’s likely that further support is likely to be 
needed for monetary policy  and fiscal policy .  I just mentioned the two risks that I think we , we 
face, and those would be well  addressed through more fiscal policy.  One is the further spread of 
the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people ’s 
balance sheets that will dwindle.  But I , you know, I think it ’s appropriate for us not to try to 
prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the 
size of it should be and leave it at that. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Nick Timiraos.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  To 
follow on Marty ’s question, you really have been saying since April that m ore is needed on the 
fiscal policy front, and yet we don’ t seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or 
the summer to additional spending.  Two questions:  Would the lack of fiscal support compel the 
Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short - and long -term rates ?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So on your first question, you know, we ’ll take into account all 
external factors and , and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue 
our goals.  That ’s what we will do.  And I ’ve said it on a couple of occasions that that will go 
better and move m ore quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government.  
And we ’ve said this in the very beginning :  It’s really , first and foremost , health -care policy, 
getting the —getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeuti cs and 
vaccines and that kind of thing, getting —so that —those are absolutely critical to the economy.  
Now, t hose are important , as well as health policies .  They’re, they’re  going to be critical to the 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 24  
 economy.  Fiscal policy can do what we can ’t, which is to replace lost incomes for people who 
are out of work through no fault of their own.  And then we —what we can do is , we can 
obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and  we can support 
demand through, through  interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing.   So we ’re, 
we’re going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors.  
So I think all of us lived through the experience of the —of the years after the G lobal 
Financial C risis.  And for  a number of years there , in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy 
was pretty tight.  And . and  I think I just would say that I think we ’ll have a stronger recovery if 
we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it’ s appropriate, you know, when it ’s 
appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate.  I do think that that will likely —and, 
by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the 
Hill that suggests generally that there will be s omething.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick 
was talking about, two questions about quantitative easing.  The first is, if the market is functioning better , as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for 
smooth market functioning, why haven’ t you reduced QE that you’ re doing if the market is 
functioning better already?  The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy , 
would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don’ t seem to 
be rising even above 1 percent?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on the first —the first question, it ’s—our asset purchases are 
serving both purchases, both—sorry, both purposes :  financial market function and support for 
economic activity.  So —and that ’s really been true— I think in the very beginning of the crisis, 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 24  
 the main focus was, obviously, financial , financial  market function, particularly in, in, you know, 
some of the major markets.  But after that period , we’ve, we’ve understood all along that our 
purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that ’s important.  And that need hasn’ t 
dwindled at all.  So , so we haven ’t looked at reducing purchases . 
So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say , the purchases that we have in 
place are providing strong support to economic activity still.  And, by the way, they ’re sustaining 
the gains we ’ve made in financial stability.  You know, we don’ t—we  don’ t take anything for 
granted.  We , we don’t expect that things will deteriorate.  But, nonetheless, we have a habit of 
keeping things in place for a while.  So we ’re not taking our gains in financial market function 
for granted, although, admittedly , they’ve been very large.  
So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy 
stance that we have.  A nd, you know, as you know, these —we ’re buying $120 billion a month.  
That’s $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables.  And it ’s just providing a lot of support for , 
for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk 
from private hands as QE3 did.  So this is a big program, and it ’s doing a lot of good.  And we 
also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease —not 
quantitative easing, the asset purchase program , and, you know, we understand the , the ways in 
which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate.  Right now, we think that this very large , effective program is delivering about the 
right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Craig Torres, Bloomberg.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Hi, Chair Powell.  First, it’ s great to see you ’re okay.  Chair Powell, 
what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment; 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 24  
 slower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates?  
And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I ’m wondering , what ’s stopping the Federal 
Reserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal support w e might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero 
boundary or that the economy does when we exit this ?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So you did— you laid out nicely the , the risks of damage 
to the supply side of the economy , or “ scarring, ” as you put it.  And we ’ve been talking about 
those since the very beginning of the pandemic.  The risk is that, for example, people are out of 
the labor force for an extended period of time.  They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it’s harder to get back.   Your skills atrophy.  It’s harder to get back in .  And the record is, if you 
don’t get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in.  And that holds down the 
whole  economy .  And, by the way, it also—it places enormous burdens on individuals who may 
have this happen to them at an important stage in their career.  So  it’s, it’s,  it’s important.  
And, you know —so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong  and so 
urgent at the beginning and why we called this , this  set of risks out.  I don’ t know how we could 
be much more vocal about it than we have been.  Fortunately , for— you know, the economic 
recovery has exceeded , certainly , the downside cases that we w ere very concerned about and 
even , even  exceeded —sort of exceeded the baseline expectations.  
Now, that ’s so far.   We are a long way from our goals.  And, you know, we ’re, we’re sort 
of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best.  And , and there are parts of the economy 
where it ’s going to be hard until there ’s a vaccine —you know, the parts of the economy.  So, you 
know, that ’s the supply -side damage.  That ’s sort of the third thing that we talk about.  The first , 
at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort.  The second —then the second part was to 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 24  
 provide support when—to the  expansion when it came.  And the third was to avoid longer -run 
damage to the economy , and that ’s, that’s  all of these things.  
I think we have been vocal.  You know, we’ll, we ’ll try to continue to do that.  And , and 
those are—that ’s again —that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding 
unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies , and unne cessary long -
term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their 
financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.  It’s, it’s 
very important that —you know, there is a real threat  here of those things , and, and, you know, 
we’re trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  [Inaudible]  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  [Inaudible]  —look like and whether you anticipate any 
consequences if they are not extended ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes , thanks.  So , first , let me say , we do think that the facilities have , 
have  generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, 
particularly acting as backstops to private markets.  So, overall, we think that the, the programs have , have  gone well.  In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question.  
You know, we ’ve had a lot of things to work our way through.  Right now we ’re just in the 
process of turning to that question and, of course , not made any decisions.  And in terms of the 
process, this is a decision that , of course , we have to make and will make jointly with the 
Treasury Department.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  David Gura.  
DAVID GURA.  [Inaudible]  IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopina th wrote —Gita Gopinath  
wrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we ’re in a global liquidity trap and 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 24  
 talked about the limits of monetary policy right now.  She said, “ Fiscal policy will need to be the 
main game in town.”   And it ’s been a b usy week.  I don ’t know if you were able to pick up the 
pink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates 
below 1 percent.  And I just wonder if you’ d agree with her , in principle, that we are in a global 
liquidit y trap , and what the consequences of that would be.  We ’ve talked a lot about fiscal 
policy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to, to fiscal policy.  My second question is , you talk about how you follow the epidemiology.  
You’re, you’re  looking  [inaudible ]. 
And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [ inaudible ] Christine Lagarde laying out 
what the ECB plans to do.  As you lent an ear to what she had to say , the dire warn ings that she 
was making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe ’s in, what can you and your 
colleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you’ ve talked about and, and 
we’ve all feared when it comes to a, a  policy response?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay , thanks.  So two questions.  First, I, I take the sense of your 
first question to be , is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo?  A nd the answer to that 
would be “ no,” I don’ t think that.  I think— I think that we are strongly committed to using these 
powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that.  And we do not doubt the power of the things that we ’ve already done or the things that we may , may  do in the future.  I do think there ’s 
more that can be done.  And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we ’ve bought, if 
you look at the facilities and , and the way we ’ve been able to keep accommodat ive financial —
financial conditio ns accommodative, I think we ’ve been able to do a lot of things that are 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 24  
 providing very strong support for the economy.  And we ’re going to —we ’re going to keep 
at that.  
I’ve said —we ’ve said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular —that the  
particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the 
part of millions and tens of millions of people.  It’s not so much a typical recession where 
demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stim ulate demand, and the economy 
recovers.  It’s a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work.  And the fiscal 
response was , was  frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States.  And it ’s 
certainly one of the main reasons w hy the recovery has been as good as it ’s been so far.  So I do 
think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here.  You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing , but where there’ s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need 
fiscal policy.  And, of course, you need health- care policy too.  
I didn’ t see Madame Lagarde’ s comments this morning, but I , I took the sense of that 
question to be the spread of the disease in Europe , and what do we think about that?  Ye s.  So, as 
I mentioned in my —in my opening remarks, it ’s a concern.  We have a widespread spike in 
cases across the country, more in some regions than others.  And even if we don’ t have —and I 
don’t expect that we would —sort of government -imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, 
though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars , and , and things like that, that they may pull back in 
a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community.  
So I do think that that ’s a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike.  
That, that  could weigh on economic activity.  One would expect that it would.  We thought the 
same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West .  And the 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 24  
 economy, you know, seemed to move right through that.  This one seems to be larger and more 
widespread.  In any case, it ’s a risk , is what I would characterize it —I would characterize it as a 
risk, as I did in my —in my comments.  
DAVID GURA.  Can I ask a quick follow -up, just about the passions of the Fed 
Chairman ?  We’ve listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked 
about what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it  at first.  You talked about the balance 
between monetary and fiscal policy.  I think in your recent comments and in Governor 
Brainard ’s comments, certainly , there ’s been more passion yet about the need for Congress to do 
more —I know that you’re  limited in what you can say or the degree to which you’d want to 
advise Congress, but a simple question:  Do you feel that you’ re being heard?  As you look at the 
prospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those who are crafting that policy , or could be , are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you’ re 
saying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me —let me  say, in the first instance, our , our main focus is on 
doing our job, and that is really what we’re, we ’re focused on is using the tools that Congress has 
given us and the assignment they ’ve given us.  And I think we ’re, we’re—that is the thing that 
we think about night and day.  I just know from , from  the experience of the last cycle, it helps to 
have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way.  And I , 
I don’t—I think— you know, I , I don’ t want to say whether I feel like I’m being heard or not .  
But, sure , I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on 
both sides of the Hill , who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that 
might be the  case.  
DAVID GURA.  Thank you.  
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 24  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence, Fox Business. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  So what 
would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long -term 
securities and Tr easuries and change the amount of spending there also?  And as a second point 
onto that, you know, would—if there ’s no fiscal stimulus package, would that then trigger 
buying of more long- term assets or change the asset purchases?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’ t really have a specific hypothetical I would —I would put 
to you.  I would just say that we , we understand that there are a number of parameters that we 
have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life , life cycle of 
the p rogram.  All of those things are , are available to us as ways to deliver addition —you know, 
more accommodation if we think that ’s appropriate.  Right now, we , we like the amount of 
accommodation the program is , is delivering.  And it will just depend on th e—on the  facts and 
circumstances.  We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front.  
Today ’s meeting was about analyzing the—one of the things it was about was about analyzing 
the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those , those  
various parameters, which I , I thought was quite a useful discussion. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria Guida.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking the question.  I wanted to ask 
about climate change.  FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need to account for financial change —climate change, I’m sorry.  What are you all thinking of doing 
on that front beyond what you’ re already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the 
network for greening  the financial system?  
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So I , I do think that the public , public  will expect and has every 
right to expect that we —that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all 
material risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks.  Climate change is , 
is one of those risks.  It’s a relatively —the science and art of incorporating climate change into 
our thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know.  And we are, you know, 
very actively , in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank 
colleagues and other colleagues around the world to t ry to think about how this can be part of our 
framework.  And we ’re watching what other —what other  countries are doing.  
We’re active participants, as you know, in the CG —no, the greening the financial s ystem.  
And, you know, we haven’ t, we hadn ’t actually formally joined, but we ’re there.  We ’re in the 
working groups, and we ’re doing all of that.  So we ’re very much working with and monitoring 
the things other central banks are doing.  You hear —you know, there ’s lots of research going on 
at the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this.  These tend to be longer -term risks.  But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time.  And, you know, we 
take it as our obligation to— you know, to understand these risks and incorporate t hem into our —
into the way we supervise and, and think about the , the overall financial system and the 
economy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider, Reuters.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Quick follow -up from Gina ’s question:   Have you gotten a 
commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it’ s necessary, 
and are you concerned what a lame- duck Trump Administration might do in that regard?  And 
then, more broadly, on the state of the economy, are y ou comfortable now that the tail risk for 
worst -case outcomes has been kind of swept aside and minimized at this point ?  Are we down, in 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 24  
 other words, to kind of household- level problems among a large set of households , perhaps , but 
that the financial crisis, double -dip recession sort of scenarios are , are off the table?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on your first question, we , we really are just turning to this issue 
now, and we have not made any decisions.  We , we are just getting started on it, and , and it’ s a 
decis ion that we ’ll make jointly with the Treasury Department.  And that ’s, that’s  really all I can 
say today.  That ’s all I have for you on that today.  
In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about 
have , have  subsided.  And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes.  
And that —you know, that ’s, that’s —what is to be expected of us is , is to think about how things 
can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right.  But we , we have to —we  do make 
policy from a risk -management  standpoint.  We don’ t just look at the most likely case.  We , we 
ask, “How do you make policy in light of the risks ?” and often it ’s downside risks in a situation 
like this.  I would not say that anybody ’s feeling comfortable about this, though.  You know, 
we’ve gotten through the first five, six months of the —of the  expansion better than expected, but 
we do see in Europe —look what ’s happening in Europe , look what ’s happening here —another 
spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more.  So I think we have to be 
humble about where we are relative to this —to this disease.  It hasn ’t gone away.  Clearly, you 
know, therapeutics are advancing , research on vaccines are advancing , death rates  are way down , 
hospitalization rates are , are lower now , but—so we ’re learning.  But, I mean, we, we are so —
we’re very far from saying that we think we ’ve got this and eliminated the tail risks.  But I think , 
clearly , the tail risks have , have  diminished s ince—at least our perception of them has 
diminished since earlier in the year.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Scott Horsley, NPR. 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 24  
 SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Earlier this summer, I know that you 
formed a task force to look at the distribution of coins around the S ystem.  I wonder if you can 
give us an update on how that ’s going.   I know there ’s been some , some  public relations effort.  I 
think October was “Get the C oins M oving ” month.  Has that —has that  problem subsided?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say why it’ s such an important —you know, in a world 
where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important 
for the relatively low -income people.  And so it ’s a really incredibly important part  of the 
payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it.  And I actually just —I just caught up this 
morning with the —with the  person who heads that operation here who, who  says that, ye s, things 
have really gotten significantly better on the coin fr ont.  So we worked very hard to increase the 
supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the S ystem and are 
happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself.   So very pleased to 
report  that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi, FT.  
JAMES POLITI.  Thanks very much for the —for the  question, Chair Powell.  We ’ve just 
had a presidential election here in the United States.  We still don ’t know who the winner is.  Are 
you concerned that perhaps tensions or  uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election 
could pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil ?  And has the Fed had any 
discussions , either internally or with the Treasury Department , about responding to that, should it  
happen?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So I ’m very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on 
the election directly, indirectly , at all , other than just to say that it ’s a good time to take a step 
back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs.  So , at the Fed here, we will, as 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 24  
 always, continue to do our jobs.  Every day we ’ll continue to serve the American people using 
our tools to support the economy during this difficult time.  You know, the —you ask if we had 
discussions .  I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we 
talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world.  We hear reports on 
how households and businesses are doing.  We talk about risks to the outlook.  We talk about what the right policy response might be.  And the election comes up in some —you know, it 
comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting.  Not at all.  So I, I’ll 
just leave it at that.  Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that.   Thanks.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Anneken, CNN. ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Thank you for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, can you tell 
us a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility  was reduced 
last week and wh y that was done now rather than earlier , seeing that small businesses are still—
clearly still—struggling to make the change necessary?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans.  
And part of that just is that the fe e structure is what it is, and that’ s the compensation that the 
banks get.  And there ’s a certain amount of work that they have to do to get —to get  into the loan 
program and do— and to document the thing , the loans that they make because these are loans 
that, you know, go on their balance sheet.  They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to 
underwrite the credit.   And we ’re relying on them , to some extent , for, for  doing that.  And so we 
were reluctant.  We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were re luctant to go below 
that.  But we heard , over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000.  
So—and, you know, we ’ve been saying we’ d have to redesign the program.  And I , I got 
the question in a —in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary  and said that.  
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 24  
 And I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay , so what would that look like if we 
were to redesign the program in a way —what’s the least thing we could do to redesign the 
program so that we could move  to a lower level?  And it—basically, we concluded we could just 
change the fee structure to create incentives for that , so we did that.  We try to be responsive.  
We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow.  And we ’ll see how much 
demand will come.  
You know, with, with  these programs, why did it —why didn’ t we do it right away?  We 
tend to—it’ s—there’ s more work than one might —certainly than I imagined in setting up one of 
these facilities.  And you , you  just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do 
everything before you start it because you ’ll never start it if you do that.  Then you get it started, 
and you make changes.  And we ’ve been willing to make changes.  That ’s the most recent set of 
ones that we ’ve done.  And, again, we hope —we hope  that it will help some companies, and I 
guess we ’ll find out.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Heather.  
HEATHER SCOTT.  Heather Scott this time, right?  Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking 
the question.  You say that you’ re—that yo u’re not out of ammo.  So I ’m wondering, then, what 
is the next tool you expect to be able to roll out?  Would you consider some sort of credit 
program for state and local businesses —state and local governments that are facing real 
budgetary pressures?  
CHA IR POWELL.  So when I say we ’re not out of ammo, I ’m looking at, you know, a 
couple of our tools , mainly.  As I mentioned, the asset purchase program —there’ s a number of 
dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate.  Right now, we like the 
job it ’s doing.  We could, you know, if , if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 24  
 new facilities.  If—you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you ’d want to 
maybe continue the facilities and , and, and maybe change them and maybe have new ones.  Who 
knows?  But , certainly , the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful , I 
think, overall in accomplishing that job.  So I do think there, there are things that we can do.  
But, r emember, we ’ve always said this will take a whole of government  approach , including 
health -care policy and fiscal policy too.  So it really is , if you —if you  want to get the economy 
back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really i t should be all of 
government working together.  
HEATHER SCOTT.  If I could just follow up on that quickly.  I mean, you spoke 
[inaudible] about the small business lending pro gram.  But that has only reached 400—there ’s 
only been 400 loans.  When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there ’s more 
that can be done with another type of program or another redesign either  for small businesses or 
for assisting state and local governments?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  There ’s a bunch of programs.  I would say that the , you know, 
the corporate —the larger corporate market -based lending program has been very successful 
without making a single loan —I think, unambiguously , has been a big success.  I think the 
success —I think the state and local government progra m has also restored market function so 
that—whereas, you know, there were the , the sort of individual investors who wind up funding 
loans in the muni market through. through mutual funds, they , they  had withdrawn a lot of 
money , and, and that —we ’ve had many weeks of consecutive , I believe, of , of inflows there, and 
you’re largely back to a normal functioning market.  I think that ’s also been a success.  I think 
the other —certainly the , the funding market programs have been a big success.

 The—Main Street is just—is just a bigger challenge than all of them.  Reaching out to 
small and medium- sized businesses through the banking system , which we had to do, is , is quite 
challenging.  I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP , were, were  a great way to reach 
smaller companies.  You know, what you hear out there is that demand— you talk to banks , and 
they’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now.  Companies are not borrowing .  And, 
and the reason is that, you know, activity ’s at a relativ ely low level.  They don’ t want to run up 
their debt.  You know, so I —we put , we put  an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very 
challenging to reach a lot of those companies.  But  I—you know, I think we , we are reaching 
many of them now , and, a nd I hope  that the new changes will help us reach more.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, there ’s a small but growing number of people , 
including some former Fed economists , who say you should find ways to go beyond your 
mandate to provide additional support to the economy , which, in essence, would be fiscal 
support , since it hasn ’t come from Congress.  One of the suggestions is buying state and 
municipal securities directly.  Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing asset 
purchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury.  Is there any 
circumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified?  How closely are you willing to work with Treasury?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so I ’m going to take your question literally.  And so if the 
idea is money -financed fiscal policy, that ’s not something that we would consider.  So that —
what I mean by that is , is really, you know, the , the central bank is really funding fiscal activities 
of the government fairly directly.  No, t hat’s not something we do.  We have different jobs.  That 
separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government.  The —you 
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 24  
 know, the job of t axation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been 
elected, and that ’s the way it should be.  There —they have to be responsible to the electorate.  
We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with  a specific set of tools to support 
maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise 
banks —all the things we ’re assigned to do.  But we , we, we’re not going to get into financing the 
government and, and—by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don’ t—it doesn’ t 
actually, as you probably know, doesn’ t change the amount of government debt outstanding.  We 
issue a reserve to , to purchase a Treasury security, and that ’s just another form —on the 
consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that ’s just another obligation.  You change 
the—you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt 
that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs.  So I don’ t know exactly 
what you ’re referring to.  But, you know, to—again, to take your question literally about 
financing fiscal activity, it’ s really not something that we think the central bank should do and, 
and not something we ’re looking at.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow up, there is a suggestion t hat you buy state and 
municipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage -backed securities, 
providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash- strapped at this point. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we ’re doing that with the Municipal Liquidity  Facility now, so 
we’re, we’re  buying, you know, with, with  our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that , 
that we ’ve gotten through Congress and the Treasury.  We ’re buying municipal securities of up 
to three years.  So we ’re doing that now as part of a n emergency facility under s ection 13(3) , you 
know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all 
clearly laid out in the law.   So we ’re, we’re actually doing that now.  
November 5, 2020    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 24  
 But I , I see—what that is , from our standpoint , is a rare thing that we do under s ection 
13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has broken 
down.  It ’s no longer working.  So we step in under 13(3) , and we provide liquidity.  What turns 
out to happen is , we an nounce a program, and the market starts working.  So we only actually 
have to do a backstop.  The amount of financing that ’s happened in the municipal markets this 
year is much higher than it was the prior year , and, and  we didn’ t do it.  We did —we ’ve done  a 
very small number of , of loans.  But just the fact that we ’re there as a backstop seems to —seems 
to get the private parties to get back together and , and get the market working again.  So that ’s 
what 13(3) is for.  
We’re not —that shouldn’ t be a permanent  thing where we’ re just another federal 
financing agency that ’s available to direct credit to —you know, to very worthy borrowers.  That 
would be more along the lines of a GSE.  That ’s not what we do.  We ’re there to provide 
emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when—you know , when —as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as we 
did after the G lobal F inancial C risis and as we will here when the time comes.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
December 16 , 2020 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us —maximum employment and 
price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide 
relief and stability, to ensure that the rec overy will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting 
damage to the economy.  Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I reaffirmed our strong forward guidance for interest rates and also provided additional guidance for our asset purchases.  Together, thes e measures will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful 
support to the economy until the recovery is complete.  
Economic activity has continued to recover from its depressed second -quarter level.  The 
substantial reopening of the economy led to a rapid rebound in activity, and real GDP rose at an 
annual rate of 33 percent in the third quarter.  In recent months, however, the pace of improvement has moderated.  H ousehold spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been 
strong and ha s moved above its pre -pandemic level.  In contrast, spending on services remains 
low, especially in sectors that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and 
hospitality.  The  overall rebound in household spending owes in part to federa l stimulus 
payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many families and individuals.  The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.  B usiness investment  has also picked up.  The recovery 
has progressed more quickly than generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised up since our September Summary of Economic Projections.   Even so, overall economic acti vity remains well below its level before the 
pandemic , and the path ahead remains highly uncertain.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 30 
 In the labor market, more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and 
April have been regained , as many people  were able to return to work.  As with overall economic 
activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has moderated.  Job growth slowed to 
245,000 in November, and while t he unemployment rate has continued to decline, it  remain s 
elevated at 6.7  percent.  Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic 
levels.  Although there has been much progress  in the labor market since the spring, we will not 
lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the un employment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 
5 percent at the end of next year and  moves below 4 percent by 2023.  The economic downturn 
has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage 
workers in the service sector and for African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic 
dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about  the future.  
The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  Following large declines in 
the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently.  For those  sectors that have been most adversely affected  by the pandemic, prices remain particularly 
soft.  Overall, on a 12- month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.  
The median inflation projection from FOMC participants rises from 1.2 percent this year to 1.8 percent next year and reaches 2 percent in 2023. 
As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is 
extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on  the course of the virus.  Recent news 
on vaccines has been very positive.  However, sign ificant challenges and uncertainties remain  
with regard to the timing, production, and distribution of vaccines as well as their efficacy across 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 30 
 different groups.  It remains difficult to assess the timing and scope of the economic implications 
of these de velopments .  The ongoing surge in new COVID -19 cases, both here in the United 
States and abroad, is particularly concerning, and the next few months are likely to be very challenging.  All of us have a role to play in our nation’s response to the pandemic.  Following the advice of public health professionals to keep appropriate social distances and to wear masks in public will help get the economy back to full strength.  A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to enga ge—reengage in a broad range of activities.  
As we previously announced, we are now releasing the entire package of our SEP 
materials at the same time as our FOMC statement.  Included in these materials are two new exhibits that show how the balance of par ticipants’ assessments of uncertainty and risks have 
evolved over time .  Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly all participants continue to judge the 
level of uncertainty about the economic outlook as elevated.  In terms of risks to the outlook, 
fewer participants see the balance of risks as weighted to the downside than in September.  
While a little more than half of participants now judge risks to be broadly balanced for economic 
activity, a similar number continue to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation.  
The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As noted in our Statement on Longer -Run Goals 
and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad- based and inclusive 
goal.  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anch ored at 2 percent.  As we reiterated in today’s 
statement, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 30 
 longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent.  We expect to maintain an 
accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are 
achieved .  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to  maintain 
the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderate ly exceed 2 percent for some time.  
In addition, as we noted in today’s policy statement, we will continue to increase our 
holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed 
securities by at least $40 billion per  month until substantial further progress has been made 
toward our  maximum -employment and price -stability goals .  We believe the increase in our 
balance sheet this year has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the e conomy.  
Combined with our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, our enhanced balance 
sheet guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.  Our guidance is outcome  based and is tied to  progress toward reaching 
our employment and inflation goals.  Thus, if progress toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a lower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher ex pected path of the balance sheet.  Overall, 
our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. 
 The Federal Reserve has also been taking broad and forceful actions to more directly 
support th e flow of credit in the economy for households, for businesses large and small, and for 
state and local governments.  Preserving the flow of credit is essential for mitigating damage to 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 30 
 the economy and promoting a robust recovery.  Many of our programs rely on emergency 
lending powers that require the support of the Treasury Department and are available only in 
very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today.  These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped to restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels.  We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent, 
enabled in large part by financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  Altho ugh funds from the CARES Act will not be available to support new loans or new 
purchases after—of assets after December 31, the  Treasury could authorize support for emerging 
lending facilities, if needed, through the  Exchange Stabilization Fund.  When the time comes, 
after the crisis has passed, we will put these emergency tools back in the box.  
As I have emphasized before, these are lending powers, not spending powers.  The Fed 
cannot grant money to particular beneficiaries.  We can only create programs or  facilities with 
broad- based eligibility to make loans to solvent entities with the expectation that the loans will 
be repaid.  Many borrowers are benefiting from these programs, as is the overall economy.  But for many others, getting a loan that may be difficult to repay may not be the answer.  In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.  Elected officials have the power to tax and spend and to make decisions about where we, as a society, should direct our collective resources.  The fiscal policy  actions that have been taken thus far have made a critical difference to families, 
businesses, and communities across the country.  Even so, the current economic downturn is the most severe of our lifetimes.  It will take a while to get back to the levels  of economic activity 
and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year, and it may take continued support from both monetary and fiscal policy to achieve that.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 30 
 To conclude, w e understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to 
using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rich Miller.  
RICH MILLER.   Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, Michelle.  I wonder 
if I could start with the , the SEP.  We have —unemployment now is at 6.7 , the SEP median sees, 
sees it falling to 5.  Headline inflation is one time 1.2, t he SEP median sees it rising to 1.8 .  And 
core inflation is 1.4 , and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise.  Would that constitute “ substantial 
further progress ” toward the C ommittee ’s maximum -employment and price -stability goals?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  Well, so we ’re not —we’re not  going to be identifying 
specific—associating that test with , with  specific numbers at this point.  So, really, the question 
is, what do we mean by, by that language ?  And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that 
our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum -employment and price -stability goals are achieved , and 
that’s, that’s  a powerful message.   So “ substantial further progress ” means what it says.  It means 
we’ll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level 
and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent  longer -run goal before we start making 
adjustments to our purchases.  
I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding 
policy accommodation.  There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation.  And when that time comes—and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off.  So I can ’t give you an exact set of numbers.  We will—of 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 30 
 course, as we approach that point, we ’ll be evaluating that.  And when we see ourselves on a 
path to achieve that goal, then we will —we will  say so undoubtedly well in advance of any time 
when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases. 
RICH MILLER.  Very quickly on, on  that.  You, you mentioned the next couple months 
are going to be very chal lenging.  And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the duration 
of the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, again, I would start with what w e actually did at the 
meeting, w hich, which was, we provided this , this  guidance about the path of asset purchases.  
And I just went through what, what they—what they—the guidance that we put forward.  And, 
you know, so I guess since September we ’ve now adopted a flexible average inflati on-targeting 
framework.  We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in 
that new framework.  And now we ’ve done the same for , for asset purchases.  So, you know, 
we’ve, we’ve  been sort of —as, as  the future has become clearer and as we ’ve absorbed new 
developments in medical —in the medical  sphere and also in , in the economy, we have —began to 
be able to see further.  So we ’ve, we’ve  started to be able to provide further important guidance.  
And we think that the —that the  asset purchase guidance, guidance  is very important.  We think 
that the , the prior language of “in coming months ” was obviously temporary.  This links that 
guidance, those purchases , to actual “substantial further progress ” toward our , our mandated 
goals.  We think that ’s important.  And we think that that is important to have done.  
I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is 
appropriate.  We think it ’s providing a great deal of support for the economy.  Fi nancial 
conditions are highly accommodative.  And, you know, we monitor a range of financial 
condition indexes.  There are many of them, and they’ ll, they’ll all pretty much tell you that.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 30 
 You can—you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy —for example, 
housing, durable sales, vehicle sales —those parts of the economy are, are  performing very, very 
well.  The parts of the economy that are weak are the service -sector businesses that involve close 
contact.  Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the 
virus.  
And I ’ll close by , by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more 
accommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels.  And we recognize that circumstances co uld shift in a way that warrants our , our doing that, including by 
adjusting purchases.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the  U.S. 
economy to achieve our goals.  We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done.  No one should doubt that.  
RICH MILLER.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nick Timiraos.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  Nick Timirao s, the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, a 
two-part question.  What , if anything, would prompt the Fed  to shift Treasury purchases toward 
the longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs?  And does your guidance today on asset purchases  foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point , lengthen 
maturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchas e amounts ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, Nick, I—on, on the first part of the question, I , I don’t —I 
wouldn’ t want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations.  You know, we , we look at our 
overall stance of policy, w e look at overall financial conditions , we look at what ’s going on in 
the economy—different parts of the economy, and w e ask ourselves, should we change our 
policy stance?  We do that at every meeting .  And we look at where financial conditions are now , 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 30 
 and, and we , we feel that they are appropriate for now.  Anytime we feel like the economy could , 
could use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it.  We—but r ight now, 
we’re providing a great deal, a nd we think—we happen to think it ’s the right amount. 
And, you know, you, you mentioned —I think you’ re referring to the idea of maintaining 
the duration but , but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did.  And 
that, that  is something that we —you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was 
addressed in the minutes.  And I would say, the views on that were mixed :  Some thought it was 
an interesting idea, others not so much.  I , I wouldn’ t say that that ’s something that ’s, that’s  high 
on our list of , of possibilities.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria . 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Victoria Guida  with Polit ico.  I want ed to ask about the 
13(3) facilities.  Chair  Powell, you’ ve said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin ’s 
interpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on , on what should happen with those programs.  
So, first of all, I ’m curious whether under a new Treasury S ecretary you will accept whatever 
legal interpretation they put forward for those programs.  And then, also, given that there isn ’t a 
statutory requirement for you to have financi al backing from Treasury for 13( 3) facilities, do you 
have any plans for any future facilities that don ’t requir e Treasury backing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So on your —on your  first question, we really have not thought about 
that.  We ’re, we’re  very focused on—we have a lot to do now.  We, we have  not focused on, on 
that question , and I , I really have nothing to add on that.  Your second question is —sorry.  Oh, if 
there were no —ye s.  No, we, we would have the ability—certainly, we would have the ability to 
do facilities under 13( 3) in some cases with no backing.  But we can ’t do any 13( 3) faciliti es 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 30 
 without the approval of the  Treasury S ecretary , right?  But we did some facilities —I think one of 
our facilities this time didn ’t have any Treasury backing.  And I think some in the —in the  round 
of—during the G lobal F inancial C risis also didn ’t have any.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  So do you have any plans —like, would you consider doing more 
facilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I would say that we are—you know, we ’re—we  have the authorities 
we have.  We will use them if , if they’ re needed and if —and if  the law permits us to do so.  We 
would—we would  always do that.  We, we do not have any plans for , for the future about this.  
We—we ’re very focused on, on getting through year -end.  We’ve been very focused on, on the 
issues that are right in front of us.  A nd, honestly, we ’re not —we’re not  planning on anything or 
having any discussions about what we might do down the road. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Liesman.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year.  I know how much 
you enjoy talking about fiscal stimulus , so let me ask you directly about fiscal stimulus.  There ’s 
talk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress.  Is , is that sufficient?  Is 
that what you’ re looking for?  Do you think that ’ll be sufficient for helping the economy?  
Finally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is.  I wonder if you can put 
some detail on that.  How much concern do you have in terms of , where could employment go?  
What could happe n to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this  surge ?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay .  So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things.  
The case for fiscal policy right now is , is very, very strong.  And I think that is widely 
understood, I would say,  now.  The details of it are entirely up to Congress.  But with the 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 30 
 expiration of unemployment benefits —some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of 
eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is , there ’s a need for households and 
businesses to have , have  fiscal support.  And I do think that —again , I think that is widely 
understood.  So I think it would be —I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is 
doing right now.  It’s not up to us to judge that work.  It ’s really, really theirs.  And I , I don’ t 
have a view for you on, on the size of it.  It ’s—you know, it’s  obviously a substantial bill.  
On the surge, you know, so it ’s a really interesting question.  We have , and others too, 
have consistently expected there to be more economic—that , that cases would hold— growth in 
cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has.  So we ’ve overestimated the, the  
effects on the economy of , of these spikes we’ ve been having.  
Now, this spike is so much larger that I thin k—and I think forecasters generally do think 
that there —that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves 
people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that.  And 
you’re starting to see that.  In the —in the  high -frequency data, you’ re now beginning to see that 
show up.  And I think if this is —the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the 
country that  that, that  seems like it must happen.  
Now, how big will it  be?  We don’ t—we don’t  really know.  You know, there are —there 
are a lot of estimates.  The general expectation is , you’ re seeing some slowing now.  And you’ ll 
see the first quarter could well be— what , what  we said is that coming months are going to be 
challenging.  The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this.  
At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now.  They ’re getting vaccinated.  And 
by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you’ re going to be seeing significant 
numbers of people vaccinated.  And so then what will be —how will that play into economic 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 30 
 activity?  Again, we don’ t have any experience with this.  You have to think that sometime in the 
middle of next year, you will —you will  see people feelin g comfortable going out and engaging 
in a broader range of activities.  And some people will be probably quick to do that.  Some are 
doing it now without a vaccine —right ?—in many parts of the country.  
So, nonetheless, my expectation—and I think many people have the expectation that the 
second half of next year should—the economy should be performing strongly.  We should be —
you know, we should be getting people back to work.  Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing.  The issue is more the next four or five months —getting through the next four, 
five, six months.  That is key.  And , and, you know, clearly there ’s going to be need for help 
there.  And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we ’ll be getting that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeann a Sm ialek.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our  questions.  I was 
wondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices.  They were mentioned in the most 
recent minutes as, you know, potential ly a valua tion concern, especially as it related to your 
mortgage -backed security purchases.  And you mentioned earlier today that the housing market 
looks more or less fully healed.  And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuation 
pressures there?  And , if so, what can the Fed  do to contain those?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the 
economy, and housing prices are something that we ’ve been monitoring.  And you see them 
moving up.  You see very high demand.  T his, this  is the housing market that people have been 
expecting since , you know, 2010.  And , and then, you know , not many, when the —when the  
pandemic hit , thought, “Oh, this is what —this is what  will produce that housing market ,” but 
it has.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 30 
 Now, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not —are not  
of a level of concern right now .  That’s just reflective of a lot of demand.  And, you know, 
builders are going to bring forth supply.  There ’s also a sense that this—some of this may be 
pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand—once 
that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable. 
So it’s a— it’s a  healthy economy now.  We, we met recently with a bunch of 
homebui lders , and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they ’ve never seen the likes of 
it.  But , no, housing prices themselves are not —are not  a financial stability concern at the 
moment.  We will watch that carefully.  But in the near term, I wouldn ’t think that that ’s an issue 
that we ’d be concerned about. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.  So with the 
actions that you’ve  currently taken, how do you—how do you further fight a slowdown that 
you’re seeing?  We ’ve talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month, 
the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down.  Is there more the Fed  can do to fight this?  
Or is it now squarely in the  Congress ’s realm? 
CHAIR POWELL.  T here is more that we can do, cer tainly.  We can —we can  expand 
our, our asset purchase programs .  We can focus them more on the longer end.  There are a 
number of options we would have to provide more support to the econom y. 
So I would—I would say , though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn’ t 
just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable 
lags.  It’s really support.  As the—as—we’ve, w e’ve talked about this as all of these government 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 30 
 policies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that was 
created by the pandemic.  And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they ’re 
across it. 
But there ’s a group for , for which they, they don’ t have a bridge yet.  And that ’s who 
we’re talking about here.  It’ s, it’s the 10 million people who lost their jobs.  It’ s people who may 
lose their homes.  It’s —you know, you see the, the —many, many millions of America ns are, are  
waiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country.  So we know there ’s need out 
there.  We know there are small businesses all over the country that , that  have been basically 
unable to really function , and they’ re just hanging  on.  So —and, and they ’re, they’re  so critical 
to our economy.  So —and , by the way, now that we can—we can  kind of see the light at the end 
of the tunnel, it would be —it would be  bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their 
life’s work in many cases, or even generations ’ worth of work, because they couldn ’t last another 
few months, which is what it amounts to.  
So we have more we can do.  And we’ll —I, I think more the issue is , we’re going to need 
to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the , the 
economy will be growing in expectation.  We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year.  But it’ s going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of , 
of labor market —the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and 
for much of the last couple of years.  So that ’s how I think about it.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider.

 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Chai r Powell.  Thanks for doing this.  And thanks, 
Michelle.  Two , two  quick questions.  One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed  modeled, 
sort of a working estimate of when the  U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity?  
And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the 
decision to maintain th e current pace and quantities of  bond purchases with the fact that the SEPs  
are showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent .  Some might argue that you need 
to do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say “ We’re going to miss 
our target for another three years ” doesn ’t show a very firm commitment to the new framework. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So , in terms of the vaccine, ye s, you know, we do estimates of , of 
when the United States would reach herd immunity, and they’ re, they’re  going to be similar to 
what other people think.  You know, i t depends on your assumptions, such as how many people 
will actually take the vaccine a nd how fast will the rollout be .  So it’ s assumption based on 
assumption based on assumption.  But , you know, sometime —it’ s possible sometime in the 
middle or second half of next year.  I ’m not going to try to be precise , because it ’s just another 
estimate.  You know, our people are very good, but they ’re looking at , at the same data as other 
people are.  And so, you know, all the estimates are —it depends on what your assumptions are.  
But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as , as soon as the middle of next year . 
In terms of the , you know, inflation, a couple things —your second question.  You know, 
we’re —I think you have to be honest with yourself about , about  inflation these days.  There 
are—there are  significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there ha ve been for a 
while , and they persist today.  It’s, is  not going to be easy to have inflation move up.  And it isn ’t 
going to be just a question—it’ s going to take some time.  It took a l ong time to get inflation 
back to 2 percent  in the last crisis.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 30 
 And, you know, we ’re, we’re  honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even 
with the very high level of accommodation that we ’re providing both through low rates and very 
high levels o f asset purchases, it will take some time, because that ’s what we believe the 
underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy.  And that ’s sort of why we ’re—one reason 
why we ’re concerned about inflation is that we see that.  And , and that ’s why we have a dopted 
the flexible average inflation -targeting framework.  That ’s why we ’re aiming for an overshoot.  
But we ’re, we’re  honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to 
get there.  
In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to , to move asset 
purchases, y ou know, I don’ t think that would really be —I think it ’s going to take a long time 
however you do it.  And, you know, we ’ve been having very long expansions since— in, in the 
last several decades because inflation has not —really , the old model was , inflation would come 
along and the Fed  would tighten, and we ’d have a recession.  
Now inflation has been low, and we haven’ t had that dynamic.  And the result has been 
three of t he four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history.  So, you know, 
we’re, we’re  thinking that this could be another long expansion, a nd that we ’ll keep our —what 
we’re saying is, we ’re going to keep policy highly accommodative until the e xpansion is well 
down the tracks.  And we ’re not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually 
reaching 2  percent  and being on track to exceed 2 percent .  That ’s a very strong commitment , 
and we think that ’s the right place to be.  
HOWAR D SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rug aber.  I’m sorry, Mr. Chair.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 30 
 CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m just going to add, markets have actually found this fairly 
credible.  If you look at what —at inflation  compensation and at the survey measures of , of when 
the Fed will lift off , everything has moved.  There have been significant movements since we 
announced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the —with the  framework being 
credible to market participants.   So I , I don’ t think it’ s something that —I, I mean, I ’m actually 
pleased by , by the reception it’ s gotten in markets.  And markets have moved in ways that 
suggest it is credible.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  T hank you.  Chris . 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.   Hi, thank you.  Yesterday, I guess, the Fed  said that it is 
joining the international financial g reening group.  And I just wanted to see if you could expand 
on how the Fed  is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed  policy going 
forward.  Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climate 
change when it comes to financial regulation.  But how do you see that also potentially affecting 
monetary policy?  Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed  for buying bonds of oil and 
gas companies.  But  leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there— is there any way that 
climate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the —you’ re, you’re  talking about the —sorry, the Network [of 
Central Banks and Supervisors ] for Greening the Financial System,  which we joined this week.  
And I ’ll just —I’ll just say a couple things about that.  So , first, I ’ll just start by saying that we ’re 
going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate  change 
affects our work, including the areas you mentioned.  We’re going to do so with a great deal of 
engagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected 
representatives who are charged with our oversight.  We ’ll do it with great transparency.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 30 
 Remember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve those 
goals are set by Congress.  We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we’ ll use 
vigorously.  We’re not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out, 
debated , and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our 
statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities.  And because we have a narrow 
remit, a nd because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from 
direct political control.  So society’ s broad response to climate change is for others to decide— in 
particular, elected leaders.  
But—so let me —let me get to your question.  What does all that mean for an issue like 
climate change?  And why did we join the NGFS?  So Congress hasn’ t explicitly assigned us or 
other financial regulators a role , and we ’re not among the agencies who contribute to the 
National Climate Assessment —Climate Assessment , for example.  But climate change is 
nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law.  And let me tell you why. 
One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the 
financial system.  That ’s a responsibility we share with other agencies.  The public will expect 
that we will —we will  do that.  So we ’ll, we’ll  expect that , that  those important institutions will 
be resilient against the many resists —risks that they fake—face:   credit risk, market risk, cyber 
risk.  Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system , and the 
economy.  And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that 
means, what needs to be done about it, and by whom.  That ’s why 83 central banks have joined 
together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area.  We’ve 
been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the w ork.  We 
had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 30 
 I’ll just say that the financial system is really a global one.  It ’s important that we work 
and discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world , especially in a field where w e’re 
just beginning to develop our , our understanding. 
You asked about monetary policy.  You know, I —I’ll say  this.  We, we have historically 
shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation.  In fact, our agreement with Treasury 
during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or ’ 10 says that we will avoid credit allocation.  It’s 
something we ’ve carefully avoided.  So I , I would be very reluctant to see us move in that 
direction, picking one are a as creditworthy and another not.  
So you asked about monetary policy.  Y ou know, it’s , it’s—for now , I would say the 
real—the real  concern is —the real place to focus,  for me , is supervision of financial institutions 
and then financial stability concerns.  You can see a connection there.  Monetary policy, 
maximum employment, stable prices —it’ s less obvious to me.  I can —I can, you know —I can 
make the argument, but it ’s less obvious to me that those should be first -order things that we 
would look at in conne ction with climate change.  But I think there ’s—I think there’s  work to be 
done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of 
financial markets and financial institutions.  I think that work is in its early days.  A nd, again, 
we’ll be careful .  We’ll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.   Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  And 
thank you, Michelle.  I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid.  J ust as one example, 
the governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to close the budget d eficit , and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that ’s being debated this week 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 30 
 seems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point.  And I ’m just curious if you can give 
some detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid s pecifically to state and 
local governments will have on the recovery  and, specifically , with the m unicipal l ending f acility 
set to expire, what more the Fed  might be able to do to fill that specific hole.  Thanks very much.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So the sta te and local governments, they provide important 
critical services:  safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that.  They ’re, they’re  really 
involved in people ’s lives, state and local governments are, to , to a large extent.  The decision 
whether to , to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress.  And , you 
know, they’ re in th e middle of these discussions, a nd, and those , those  are issues for them to 
decide.  
I would say that the picture is mixed.  What ’s happened is, if you’ re a state that has a 
significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground— oil from the ground, or 
gas—you are probably, at least in those industries , feeling a significant loss of revenue.  A 
number of other states have been surprised on the upside, where —and that ’s because goods  
sales, for example—property taxes are—don’ t move much year to year.  And, you know, the 
kind of sales taxes on goods —goods  sales have been very high.   Income has been more or less 
replaced by, by  the CARES Act —fully replaced , more than, in many cases.  So the concerns that 
we had at the very beginning of really serious , deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the 
part of state and local governments have not yet —have not yet  occurred.  What w e’re seeing is, 
is that it’ s different state to state.  And some states are having significant difficulties, others not 
so much.  
The real concern , though , that still emerges is , state and local governments are very large 
employers, and—one of the largest.  And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 30 
 dropped by 1.3 million in—of  state and local government.  So it ’s, it’s a very large number of 
people to be —to be  out of work from just that one source.  It’s actually significantly more than 
lost their job s during the Global F inancial C risis.  
So that is —that is  a significant —a significant  part of that group is , is in education.  So 
when the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work.  
Nonetheless, it ’s a concern.  We’re, we’re watching carefully to understand why that —why that  
many people have been let go and what are —really are the sources.  So we ’re monitoring it 
carefully, and it ’s a mixed picture.  And I , I just have to leave the question of what to do with 
fiscal policy  on this to Congress.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi.  
JAMES POLITI.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell.  You and the Fed  
have consistently said that the Fed  is ready to provide the economy with more monetary support 
if needed a nd really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enough 
outweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there ’s so much suffering in the 
economy.  The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of  time but is  
not a big new easing step.  Why was now , with the short -term outlook deteriorating due to the 
new coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step?  And is it because of the medium- term outlook improving?  Or is it because the Fed  just doesn’ t have the capacity to sort 
of build that bridge over the next four to five months for the —for the  people who are struggling?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Right .  So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is , 
this is —this is  a very, very lar ge asset purchase program.  It’ s providing a tremendous amount 
of, of support for the economy.  If you look at the interest- sensitive parts of the economy, they’ re 
performing very well.  The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 30 
 interest rates.  They ’re struggling from exposure to, to COVID, i n a sense .  These are —these are 
the businesses that , that  are really hit hard by people ’s reluctance to gather closely . 
So, so we , we do have the ability to —you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer -term 
bonds.  And , and we may —we may  use it.   I’m not saying we won’ t—we won’t  use that .  It may 
well come to , to using that.  But also, I would remind —I would  also note , though, monetary 
policy works with “ long and variable lags, ” is the famous statement.   So we think that the big 
effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future.  So this looks 
like a—you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy.  And , and 
that’s why it is , is a very positive thing that, that  we’re getting that.  
So we , we remain open to doing—you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset 
purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities , because that had —that also increases accommodation by taking more duration 
risk out of the market.  But we think our current stance is appropriate.  And we think that our —
you know, that our , our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the 
economy over time.  Again, what we ’ve—what we’ve  done is , we’ve laid out a path whereby 
we’re going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until —really 
until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know , not really the way it ’s been done 
in the past.  So that ’s, that’s  providing significant support for the economy now. 
We don’ t think the economy suffers from a lack of , of highly accommodative financ ial 
conditions.  We think it ’s suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in 
certain kinds of economic activity.  And we expect that , that  with the virus, that that will 
improve —that condition will improve.  Nonetheless, again, we will—ar e prepared to use our 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 30 
 tools , and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we—as we think would, 
would help.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Scott Horsley, NPR.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some forecasters have suggested that 
there is  a lot of pent -up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that 
might stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely 
distributed, a nd that the beaten -down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in, 
in a hurry.  How might that affect inflation , in your mind?  And would that be just a transient 
problem or , or something that might warrant closer scrutiny?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that , that  has all the markings of a transient  increase in the price 
level.  So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again—let ’s say, you know , that 
airfare, airfares —I’m just imagining this, right ?—that they go up.  But what inflation is, is a 
process whereby they go up year upon year  upon year upon year.  And if —given the inflation 
dynamics that we ’ve had over the last several decades, just a single, single  sort of price -level 
increase has not resulted in ongoing price -level increases.  
And that , that  was—the problem back in the 1970s was , it was the combination of two 
things.  One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up.  But the second problem was that that —that that increase was persistent, there was a level of 
persistence.  So if prices went up 6 percent  this year, they ’d go up 6 percent  next year, because 
people would internalize.  I mean , really, really , that ’s what happens is , people internalize that 
they can raise prices, and that it ’s okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate.  So  that was 
the inflation —those are the inflation dynamics of that era.  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 30 
 Those dynamics are not in place anymore.  The re—the  connection between low 
unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was.  It ’s still 
there , but it ’s a—it’s a  faint heartbeat compared to what it was.  And  the persistence of inflation, 
if you—if you get a —for example, oil prices go up, a nd that ’ll send a temporary shock through 
the economy.  The persistence of that into , into inflation over time is  just not there.  So they—
what you describe may happen, a nd, of course , we would watch it very carefully.  We , we 
understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will 
behave in certain cases.  But I would—I would expect , though, going in that that would be a 
one-time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  So not the kind of thing that the Fed  would , would be trigger -happy 
to, to—  
CHAIR POWELL.  No. 
SCOTT HORSLEY.  — respond to?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, no.  Definitely not.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael Derby.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  [Inaudible] —question.  But w hat I wanted to ask was, you know, 
given the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes in the financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market , long run, can operate smoothly 
without some sort of active Fed  presence—you know, buying Treasury debt?  You know, I ’m 
referring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles.  He  had some questions  about it .  So I wanted to 
know where you stood on that issue.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So —you we re breaking up a little.  I think —I think  I got the 
sense of it, though.  Ye s, I, I don’ t think it’ s at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 30 
 permanent Fed  presence.  And we certainly don’ t—you know, that ’s not something we ’re 
planning on or intending.  Right now we ’re buying assets because it ’s a— you know, it ’s a—it’s a  
time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset 
purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet.  
You know, there ’s lots of demand for , for U.S. Treasury paper all —from all over the 
world.  And I , I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market and 
look at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector.  And there ’s, there’s  quite a lot of work going on on that front .  But I , I don’t presume at all that, 
that this is something that needs to be —where the Fed  needs to be in there at all.  I , I would think 
that this should be handled by the private sector and can be.  Institutions need to be able to hold this paper .  And there may be —there may be  a central clearing angle that would, you know, net a 
lot of risk.  That’s, that’s  yet to be proven.  There are a lot of things that are being looked at 
right  now.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang . 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, hi.  Thanks so much for taking our questions.  So , you know, as 
you know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium -sized 
businesses.  And the Fed  launched a few efforts this year to—through its 13( 3) prog rams to reach 
out to those companies.  But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, is there anything else that the Fed’s actions can do to provide support to those companies?  Or is 
that solely Congress ’s domain?  
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 30 
 CHAIR POWELL.  I think the main thing that those companies need is a —is a robust 
recovery—a strong, robust recovery.  And so we , we contribute to that through highly 
accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are 
supporting economic activit y.  Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, you 
know, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of those 
vaccines.  And Congress contributes , contributes  to that by helping them make it through this 
very difficult time.  And , and I think my understanding is that there ’s support for small 
businesses in , in what ’s being discussed on Capitol Hill.  I would certainly think that would be 
something well worth looking at.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Paul  La Monica. 
PAUL LA MONICA.   Hi, Chair Powell—hi, Chair Powell .  I was wondering if you’ ve 
had any conversations yet with any members of the incoming Biden A dministration, particularly 
Janet Yellen, who obviously you can share some similar experience in running the Fed .  So just 
curious to get your thoughts on how the relationship with Treasury and the new A dministration 
might differ than the past couple of years.  
CHAIR POWELL.   So, you know, we ’ve had a —and I ’ve had sort of the typical 
meetings with the transition team for Treasury.  They ’ve met with quite a lot of people in our 
agency and other agencies.  And , really, it’ s about learning what we do.  And I , I really have only 
spoken to f ormer Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated a nd just to say that I look 
forward to working with her.  You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know.  So I did that.  But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her.  And I , I’m  not going to do that until she ’s confirmed.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Great, thank you.  Jeff C ox. 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 30 
 JEFF COX .  Yes.   Chair, thank you for taking the question.  You ’ve been asked this 
question before in various forms.  I ’m going to try it a little bit differently now.  The equity 
market and the bond market seem to be telling two different stories about where , where  things 
are heading.   We [ inaudible]  on the stock market , bond yields remain very low.  Does that 
concern you at all?  A re, are you getting any more concerned about asset  valuations in, in light of 
the highly accommodative Fed  policies?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You, you were breaking up, but I , I think I got that.   I think I got it.  
So, you know, financial stability—we , we look at a broad range of things.  We actually have a 
framew ork so that we can, you know, be —evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and 
so that the public can evaluate whether we’ re doing a job—a good job at it.  We —so what do we 
look at?  Asset prices is one thing that we look at.  And , you know, we published a report a few 
weeks ago on that —maybe it was month or so ago.  A nyway.  And I think you’ ll find a mixed 
bag there.  It depends —with equities, it depends on whether you’ re looking at P /Es or whether 
you’re looking at the premium ove r risk -free—over the risk -free return.  
If you look at P /Es, they ’re historically high, but , you know, in a world where the —
where the  risk-free rate is sustain —is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, 
which is really the reward you get  for taking equity risk, would be what you’ d look at.  And 
that’s not at , at incredibly low levels, w hich would mean that they’ re not overpriced in that 
sense.  Admittedly, P /Es are high, but that ’s—you know , that ’s, that’s  maybe not as relevant in a 
world  where we think the 10- year Treasury is going to be lower than it ’s been historically, from 
a—from a  return perspective.  
You know, we look at —we also look at borrowing—leverage of financial institutions.   
We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years buil ding up their capital.  So far, they’ ve been a 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 30 
 source of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well.  We look at leverage in 
the nonfinancial sector —that’s households and nonfinancial corporates.  Nonfinancial corporate 
leverage is high.  We ’ve been watching that.  But , you know, rates are really low.  So —and so 
companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are—
rates are quite low.  Your interest payments are low.  Defaults and downgrades  have , have  
declined since earlier in the year.  Households came into this very strong, and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed.  But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress 
replaced a lot of lost income.  You know, it ’s very  important that , that  the economy gets strong 
again.  I mean, the , the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy. 
The last thing is , is really funding markets.  W e found that there was a lot of unstable 
funding for companies, partic ularly financial companies.  And that ’s, that’s  down to a —to a very 
low level these days.  So the broad financial stability picture is , is kind of mixed, I would say.  I 
would say, you know, asset prices are , are a little high in that metric and in my view .  But , 
overall, you have a mixed picture.  You , you don’ t have, you know, a lot of red flags on that.  
So—and it’s —again, it ’s something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily.  You 
know, we ’re, we’re  monitoring these prices for that and , and have published our , our framework, 
and, you know, we ’ll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed.  So we work 
very hard at it . 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  And for the last question we ’ll go to Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscal 
support for the economy.  This year ’s budget deficit is $3.1 trillion.  And Republicans have 
argued they don’ t want to spend more, because we can ’t afford it.  So I ’m wondering if you can 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 30 
 make the case for how mu ch we can afford.  At what point do deficits and the debt start to have 
an impact on the economy or on interest rates?  And how would we know when we get there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So people who—people who run for elected office and win, they’ re 
the ones —their reward is they get to make those very difficult de cisions.  And—you know, so 
we’re not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress.  But I , I would just say, as a  
general —as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path.  F or my way of 
thinking and many others ’, the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when 
unemployment is low and taxes are —you know, are , are pouring in, and there ’s, there’s room to 
get on—get on a sustainable path, because the economy ’s really doing well.  You ’re still now in 
the—in the , you know, some part of , of an  economic crisis.  And the fact that Congress is 
debating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that—you know, suggests that something fairly 
substantial is going to get done, we hope —that what ’s being discussed is, you know, is , is of 
some size.  
In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it’s —the question is —we ’ve 
always looked at debt to GDP, and we ’re very high by that measure.  By some other measures, 
we’re actually not that high.  In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the 
amount of , what does it cost?  And from that standpoint, if you—if you sort of take real interest 
costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we ’re actually —you know , we’re actually on 
a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes.  Again, these are —these are 
issues for Congress.   But , you know, I ’ll just say in the near term, I think fiscal —the case for , for 
fiscal is, is  strong.  And I ’m certainly hoping—I think it will be very good for the economy if , if 
we did get something soon. 
December 16, 2020   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 30 of 30 
 MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, the  argument for continuing to spend is that low interest 
rates make it affordable.   Do you worry you get  in a situation where you would have 
congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure 
to keep rates low because the country can ’t afford to pay a significant interest bill?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I mean, that ’s—I think we ’re a ve ry, very long way from that.  
You know, the , the Congress has given the Fed  independence on the condition that we stick to 
our knitting.  We try very hard to do that.  And I , I think that ’s, that’s  what people call fiscal 
dominance.  And I , I think we ’re just a very, very long way from that.  I think, you know, if 
we—if we  do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and 
stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don ’t think that that is something that will—that 
I would worry about, certainly not in the near term.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
January 27, 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.   Good a fternoon.  At the Federal Reserve,  we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us :  maximum employment and 
price stability.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken forceful actions to provide 
relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  Today my c olleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero 
and maintained our sizable asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on 
interest rates and our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver 
powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.  
The path of the econom y continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus.  A 
resurgence in recent months  in COVID- 19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is causing great 
hardship for millions of Americans and is weighing on economic activity and job creation.  
Following a sharp rebound in economic activity last summer, the pace of the recovery has 
moderated in recent  months , with the weakness concentrated in the sectors of  the economy most 
adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing .  Household 
spending on services remains low , especially in sectors that typically require people to gather 
closely, including travel and hospitality.  And  household spending on goods has moderated 
following earlier large gains.  
In contrast, t he housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, 
supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.  Business investment and manufacturing production h ave also picked up.  The overall recovery  in econom ic activity since last spring is 
due in part to federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits, which have provided essential support to many families and individuals .  The recently enacted C oronavirus 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 28  
 Response and Relief Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021]  will provide additional 
support .  Overall economic activity remains below its level before the pandemic , and the path 
ahead remains highly uncertain.  
As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has 
slowed in recent months .  Employment  fell by 140 ,000 in December , as continued gains in many 
industries  were outweighed by significant  losses in industries where the resurgence of the virus 
has weighed further on activity .  In particular, the leisure and hospitality sector lost nearly half a 
million jobs , largely from  restaurants and bars.  T he unemployment rate remain ed elevated at 
6.7 percent  in December, and p articipation in the labor market is notably below pre -pandemic 
levels.  Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of 
Americans remain out of work.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least  able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level 
of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the service sector and for 
African Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended man y lives and 
created great uncertainty  about the future.  
The pandemic has also left a significant imprint on inflation.  Following large declines in 
the spring, consumer prices picked up over the summer but have leveled out more recently.  For those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, prices remain particularly soft.  Overall, on a 12- month basis, inflation remains below our 2 percent longer -run objective.  
While we should not underestimate the challenges we currently face, several 
developments point to an improved outlook for later this year.  Sufficiently w idespread 
vaccinations would enable us to put the pandemic behind us  and return to more normal economic 
activities .  In the meantime, continued observance of social -dista ncing measures and wearing 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 28  
 masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible.  S upport from fiscal policy will help 
households and businesses weather the downturn as well as limit lasting damage to the economy 
that could otherwise impede the recovery.   In addition , as we have seen since last summer, the 
economy has proved more resilient than expected, in part reflecting the adaptability of households and businesses.  Finally, monetary policy is playing a key role in supporting the recovery and will con tinue to do so.  
The Fed’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Today we unanimousl y reaffirmed our Statement 
on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as we typically do each January.  As we say  
in that statement, we view maximum employment as a “broad -based and inclusive goal.”   Our 
ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having 
longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2  percent.  
As the Committee  reiterated in to day’s policy statement , with inflation running 
persistently below 2  percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2  percent for 
some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored at 2  percent.   We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of m onetary 
policy until these  employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.   With regard to interest rates, 
we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range 
for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the 
Committee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2  percent and is on 
track to moderately exceed 2  percent for some time.   In addition, we will continue to increase our 
holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80  billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 28  
 securities by at least $40  billion per month until substantial further progress has been made 
toward our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  T he increase in our balance sheet 
since last March  has materially eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to 
the economy.  T he economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is 
likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.  
Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate , along with our balance sheet guidance , 
will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery 
progresses.  Our guidance is outcome  based and ties  the path of the federal funds rate and the 
balance sheet  to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.  Thus, if progress 
toward our goals were to slow, the guidance would convey our intention to increase policy accommodation through a l ower expected path of the federal funds rate and a higher expected 
path of the balance sheet.  Overall, our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing 
powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so.  
We’ve also taken  actions to more dir ectly support the flow of credit in the economy, 
deploying our  emergency lending powers to an unprecedented extent, enabled in large part by 
financial backing and support from Congress and the Treasury.  Although the CARES Act facilities are no —are no  longer ope n to new activity , our other facilities remain in place . 
To conclude, w e understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to  your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 28  
 JEANNA SMIALEK .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek  from the New York Times. 
Thank you for taking our questions.  I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that 
game stock —GameStop ’s stock has had this week.  And then, secondarily, you and your 
colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the 
first line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks.  But your macroprudential tools primarily apply to the banks.  I ’m wondering what your plan is, if you see som e sort of large 
financial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search -for-yield kind of activities.  You know, what, what do you see as 
the solution there?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on, on your first question, I don’ t want to comment on a 
particular company or, or day ’s market activity or things like that.  It ’s just not really something 
that I would typically comment on.  
In terms of macroprudential policy tools, s o, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of 
always- on, through- the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also 
the elevated levels of liquidity and capital a nd, and , and also resolution planning that we —that 
we impose on the l argest financial institutions.  We don’ t use time -varying tests and tools as 
some other countries do.  And we think it ’s a good approach because— for us to use ones that are 
always- on— because we don ’t really think we ’d be successful in every case in picking  the exact 
right time to intervene in markets.  So that ’s for banks. 
You really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector.  And so we monitor financial 
conditions very broadly.  And while we don’ t have jurisdiction over , over  many areas in the 
nonbank sector, other agencies do.  And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability 
Oversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for , for nonbank supervision.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 28  
 And, i n fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far.  And , 
and the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the 
pandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector.  So that ’s—right now we are engaged in, in 
carefully examining, understanding , and thinking about what , what  in the nonbank sector will 
need to be addressed in the next year  or so. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you .  James Politi, FT . 
JAMES POLITI.  Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell.  I had a question on 
fiscal policy.  Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support a nd, I 
believe, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December.  We have —
now have a new , new  President , a new Congress.  We have a weakening short -term outlook.  Do 
you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side?  And in what areas?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So I guess I ’d start by saying that the , the fiscal response 
that we ’ve seen to this downturn has be en strong , and I think we can say now that it ’s been 
sustained after th e passage of the—of the , the most recent act in , in late December.  And that ’s 
really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it ’s been.  Fiscal policy has been 
absolutely essential.  When we look back on, on the history of this period, we ’ll see a strong and 
sustained fiscal policy response.  
I would—I would add that we ’re, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery.  
Something like 9 m illion people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic.  That ’s 
as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the G lobal F inancial C risis and the Great 
Recession.  Many small businesses are under pressure, and there ar e other needs to be addre ssed.  
And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 28  
 So, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for 
Congress and the A dministration and not for the Fed.  And these discussions are going on right 
now.  So there ’s a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions, 
and, and that ’s appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you .  Steve Lies man.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. C hairman.  I wonder if I could follow up on 
Jeanna’ s question here.  I understand that you do address issues of , of valuations through 
macroprudential policies in the first instance , but there ’s a range of assets .  And I know you do 
watch a range of assets.   But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to 
some of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop , how do you address the 
concern that super easy monetary policy—asset purchases and zero interest rates— are 
potential ly fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Let me —let me  provide a little context.  The shock that the —from 
the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of 
unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.  There ’s nothing close to it 
in our modern economic history.  So our response was really to that .  And we—we ’ve done what 
we could, first , to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the 
recovery.  And , hopefully, we ’ll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer -run 
damage to the —to the economy.  
Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment a nd stable prices and also look 
after financial stability.  So, in a world where , almost a year later, we’re, we’re still 9  million 
jobs, at least —that ’s one way of counting i t; it can actually be counted much higher than that —
short of maximum employment an d people are out of the labor force who were in the labor 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 28  
 force —the real unemployment rate is close to 10  percent  if you include people that ’ve left the 
labor force —it’s very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to 
support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2  percent  
and averaging 2 percent  over time.  
So, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework.  We don’ t look at one 
thing or two things.  We look at —and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so 
that it c ould be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable.  And , you know, the 
things that we look at are —we do look at asset prices.  We also look at leverage in the banking 
system.  We look at leverage in the  non—the  nonbanking system, which is to say , corporates and 
households.  And we look at also funding risk.  And if you look at it across that range of , of, of 
readings, they’ re each different, but we monitor them carefully.  And I would say that financial 
stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate.  
Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to , to shocks of all 
kinds, that it ’s strong and resilient.  And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds 
and, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well.  So when we get to the 
nonfinancial sector, we don’ t—we don’t  have jurisdiction over that.  
But—so I would just say that our —that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, 
to setting asset prices.  So if you look at what ’s really been driving asset prices, really , in the last 
couple of months , it isn ’t monetary  policy.  It’s been expectations about vaccines.  And it ’s also 
financial— sorry, fiscal policy .  Those are —those are the news items that have been driving , 
driving asset purchases —sorry, asset values in , in recent months.  
So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there , but that ’s how we look at it.  
And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and , and asset 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 28  
 values is probably something that ’s not as tight as people think, because a lot of —a lot of  
different factors are driving asset prices at any given time.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Can I  follow up, Michelle, if you don’ t mind ?  Mr. Chairman, do 
you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to 
address asset values?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, that ’s—as you know, that ’s one of the very difficult 
questions in all of monetary policy.  And we don ’t rule it out as a theoretical matter , but we , we 
clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in , in addressing financial stability issues.  It’s not —you know, the , 
the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well -
understood channels.  And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stabilit y.  
That will mean strong, you know, well -capitalized institutions , and, and households will be —
will be working.  And , and so we know that.  
We don’ t actually understand the tradeoff between—the sense of it is, would you—if you 
raise interest rates and ther eby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in 
order to address asset bubbles and things like that , what —will that even help?  Will it —will it 
actually cause more damage, or will it help?  So I think that ’s unresolved.  And I , I think it ’s, it’s 
something we , we look at as not , not theoretically ruled out but not something we , we—we ’ve 
ever done a nd not something we would plan to do.  We would rely on macroprudential and other 
tools to deal with financial stability issues.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael Derby.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 28  
 MICHAEL DERBY.  Yes.  Thank you very much.  I wanted to ask you, if there is a near -
term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it ’s 
something that ’s temporary or more enduring?   And how much inflation is the F ed willing to 
tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on inflation,  a couple of things —there are a couple of things that 
are worth mentioning.  One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12 -month 
basis.  And as we —as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, 
we’ll see measured 12 -month inflation move up a few tenths.  This is just —they’ re called base 
effects , and, and that ’s a—that’s a transient thing that we think will pass.  
There ’s also the possibility —indeed, it ’s in some forecasts— that as the economy fully 
reopens, there ’ll be a burst of spending, and—because people will be enthusiastic that the 
pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation.  
Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large.  I n 
both cases, we d on’t see those as either lasting or particularly large.  So the way we would react 
is, we’re going to be patient.  Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we 
would review —we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation.  
I think  if you —you know, it helps to look back at , at the inflation dynamics that the 
United States has had now for some decades a nd notice that there has been, you know, 
significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades.  Inflation has 
averaged less than 2  percent  for a quarter of a century.  And the inflation dynamics , with the flat 
Phillips c urve and low persistence of inflation , is very much intact.  Those things, they change 
over time.  We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’ t 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 28  
 change rapidly.  So we think it ’s very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you 
know, troubling inflation. 
Of course, if w e did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have 
tools for that.  It’ s far harder to deal with , with  too low inflation.  We know what to do with 
higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we , we would have those tools.  And 
we don’ t expect to see that at all.  
In terms of how much, you know, what we ’ve said is we ’d like to see —because inflation 
has been running persistently below 2 percent , we’d like to see it run moderately above 2  percent  
for some time.  We have no t adopted a formula.  We’re not going to adopt a formula.  We’re 
going to—w e, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, 
but we don’ t set policy by them.  We don ’t do that.  And so we ’re going to preserve an element 
of judgment.  
And, again, we ’ll seek inflation moderately above 2  percent  for some time.  And we ’ll, 
we’ll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent .  The , the way to achieve 
credibility on that is to actually do it.  And so that ’s what we ’re planning on doing. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  R achel  Siegel . 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our 
questions.  I have a two -pronged question about vaccines.  So you specifically mentioned 
progress in the rollout of vaccines , but there is still plenty that we don ’t know about supply over 
the coming weeks and months.  So I ’m curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in 
vacci ne rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like.  
And then, secondly, I ’m wondering if you, yourself haven’t —has been —have been 
vaccinated , along with other FOMC members.  Thank you. 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So , in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else 
sees, right?  We see that we’ re, we’re  vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, 
apparently , and that  it’ll take quite a while to get —to get  to the numbers that the expert s say are 
required to get to herd immunity.  And we think it ’s going to be a struggle.  
You’ll notice that we , we said that the , the pandemic still, still  provides considerable 
downside risks to the economy.  And that’s one of the reasons why, is that —is th e slowness of 
the rollout.  The other —another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains.  We 
don’t know how to—we do n’t know how to model that.  You know, we can have a base case, but 
we realize no one knows how the —how this new vaccine wil l roll out, how successful it will be, 
how high we ’ll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things.  
So we have a base case, and we —but we always —we always look at , at the range of 
possibilities.  In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks.  You know, that ’s really 
what we do is , we, we set policies so that we’re , we’re, you know , we’re going to remain 
accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in 
the data.  So that’s, that ’s how we think about , about  that.  
And I would—I would also add, there ’s nothing more important to the economy now 
than, than people getting vaccinated.  You know, if you—if you, you think about the places 
where the economy is weak—I mentioned bars and restaurants .  That’s 400,000 jobs we lost last 
month, a nd that ’s all because of the spread of the pandemic.  Many other  areas of the economy —
actually, there was actually job creation in —you know, in goods production and in some service 
parts —industries as well.  But we ’re just not going to be able to get that last group of people 
back to work—and it ’s a big group of people —until we get the pandemic behind us.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 28  
 We, we  have not won this yet.  We haven ’t succeeded in doing this yet , and we need to 
stay focused on it as a country and , and get there .  And, you know, we clearly can, but we ’re 
going to have to stay focused.  A nd that includes —you know, that includes us at the F ed, 
monetary policy.  
I, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon.  
Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  M ichael  McKee. 
MICHAEL MCKEE .  A question— I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need 
to follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential , and that is, 
you have one tool you can use .  Would you be discussing— have you discussed raising margin 
requirements under R egulation T?  And, if not, why not?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, we haven’ t—we haven’t  done that.  I mean, remember, we ’re, 
we’re  focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it— the 
broad financial sector.  And, and that —that’s  not, you know —over the years, we, we  consult the 
fact that we have that authority.  But , no, it ’s not something we ’re loo king at right now at all.  
MICHAEL MCKEE .  All right.  My follow -up question is, a lot of people in the markets 
think that you’ re basically stuck right now, because you can’ t really go lower with the zero 
bound, rejecting negative interest rates , and you ca n’t really go higher because of the thr eat of a 
taper tantrum.  Is the F ed locked into a very narrow corridor now?  And , if not, you did say you 
would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead.  But [former]  New York F ed 
President Bill Dudley s ays there ’s no way you can avoid a taper tantrum.  So how do you do 
that?  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL. Well, first , I—we , we think our policy stance is , is just right.  We 
think it ’s providing significant support for economic activity and hiring.  We, you know, we , we 
adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August.  In 
September, we, we implemented rate guidance that , that  was consistent wit h and based on that 
new framework.  In December, we did the same for asset purchases.  
So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that ’s 
providing very strong support for economic activity.  If you look at the sectors of t he economy 
that are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity :  housing, durable goods, automobile 
sales.  So, you know, our , our policies are working.  And we think that , that  they are —we think 
our policy stance is , is right.  
That said, there’ s clearly more that we can do.  With asset purchases, for example,  we 
can, you know —that ’s, that’s  a tool we can do more —we can strengthen our guidance , too, if we 
were to think that that were appropriate.  What you see is an economy where what ’s holding it 
back is not the lack of , of policy sup port from the F ed.  It’ s the pandemic .  It’s, it’s the spread of 
the disease and people ’s reluctance or , or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic 
activities, which amount to a , a meaningful part of the economy.  So that ’s, that’s  what I would 
say.  We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we ’re—we think we’re  in the 
right  place.  
You know, in terms of —in terms of tapering, it ’s just premature.  We just created the, the  
guidance.  We said we ’d want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we 
modify our , our asset purchase guidance.  It ’s just too early to be talking about dates, which we 
should be focused on, on  progress.  We’ll need to see actual progress.  And when, when we see 
ourselves getting to that point, we ’ll communicate clearly about it to , to the public  so nobody 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 28  
 will be surprised when the time comes.  And we ’ll do that well in advance of actually 
considering what will be a pretty gradual  taper.  
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Well, if I might, you—your policies are working, and you can 
maybe do more.  But the question is, can you stop doing it when it ’s time?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So, you know, I , I was here—we had all the same questions 
back in —after the G lobal F inancial Crisis.  We raised interest rates .  We froze the balance sheet 
size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size.  So there ’s no reason why we , we won ’t be able 
to do that again.  In fact, we learned a lot from that experience.  
And, you know, we , we understand —as we understood then, but even more so—we 
understand that the —that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to , to do 
predictab le things, and to move gradually.  And that ’s, that’s  what we ’re going to do.  We’ re 
going to be very transparent.  
But, honestly, no—you know, the whole focus on exit is premature , if I may say.  We ’re 
focused on finishing the job we ’re doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy 
the support it needs.  There are people out there who’ ve lost their jobs.  It’s essential that we get 
them back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that.  And 
that is our primary focus right now.  It ’s, it’s, it’s too soon to be —to be worried about that.  You 
know, when we come to exit, we have a —we have an understanding of how to do that , and we ’ll 
do it very carefully.  But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.   I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a 
second.  You know, we just had a $900 billion  package , and now Congress is talking about doing 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 28  
 more.  Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary?  And , specifically, how 
worried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I, I would say that , again, we have been struggling with 
disinflationary forces for some time.  If you look around the world—look in Western Europe, 
look at Japan—around the world, large economies have , have  felt much more downward 
pressure on inflation, have fallen short of  their inflation goals , for some time now.  That is the 
broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in.  
And we believe that those global forces —which are, you know, aging demographics, 
advancing technology, and globalization—those , those  forces are still in effect.  Now, they may 
slow down, a nd, and it ’s, it’s an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, 
globalization may slow down or even reverse.  Notwithstanding that , inflation dynamics in the 
United States have , have  consis ted of a flat Phillips c urve and low persistence for , for a long 
time.  We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly.  It may evolve over 
time, but significant time.   You know, these things are —these things are, are  changing, but they 
don’t change at a rapid rate.  And  there’s —I, I don’t believe that , that  they will.  
So I wouldn’t —I’m, I’m not —I’m  much more worried about falling short of a complete 
recovery and losing people ’s careers and lives that they —that they  built because they don ’t get to 
work —back to work in time and things like that.  I’m more concerned about that and the damage 
that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of 
the economy.  I ’m more concern ed about that than about the possibility, which exists , of higher 
inflation.  Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation.  The kind of 
troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems , seems  far away and unlikely in, in  
the both domestic and global context that we ’ve been in for some time.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 28  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Matthews, Bloomberg.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her 
employees yesterday, spoke of  the close working re lationship with the Federal Reserve.  And I ’m 
wondering how you would describe the relationship with , with  Treasury under Chair Yellen , if 
you’ve met with, with , with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has 
taken office . 
And, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there  was 
constant criticism from the —of the F ed from the P resident and from other officials of the 
Administration.  Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now b e more of 
a hands -off attitude , in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the A dministration?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay .  So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary 
Yellen.  And I ’m, I’m sure that we ’re going to have a , a good working relati onship together.  
Absolutely sure.  We ’ll also have a good institut ional relationship between the F ed and the 
Treasury.  And I expect that that ’ll be very good and, and very productive.  It’ll be collaborative .  
We’ll work together.  
Now, the way that works is , is that, you know, we know —the agencies know each other 
well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world.  We know to stay 
in our lanes.  We know we have different authorities.  We know that we work together on some  
things to —you know, for the benefit of the public.  And I ’m, I’m  absolutely sure that we ’re 
going to do that.  
I, you know, haven’ t—I haven’t  spoken to, to Secretary Yellen —I’m going to be calling 
her “ Chair Yellen ” most of the time, so you just have to be  patient with me —Secretary Yellen .  I 
haven’ t spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated.  I do expect very soon to 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 28  
 begin our regular calls or —and, and ultimately meetings , which have gone on, really , for, you 
know, 70 years.  T he Treasury Secretary and the, and the  Fed Chair have had weekly or so 
meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation.  So I expect that will —that will 
happen soon. 
I’ve—I have not met the , the President, President Biden.  And just , you know, I , I, 
I don’ t—I don’t  have any comment on your —on your last question.  I wouldn’ t want to 
comment one way or the other.  
STEVE MATTHEWS. Just to  follow up brief ly, you have some 13(3)  emergency 
programs that  will expire March  31 that the F ed and the Treasury have worked on together.  Do 
you have an expectation of whether those will be left , left to expire then or whether they will be 
extended?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I —I’ll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in 
supporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved —protected the loss of 
millions of jobs.  We’ re going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout 
the economy.  And , and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that 
law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available.  
Now, I ’ve had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven’ t had 
any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet —you know, high- level meetings with 
the—with the  transition team a month or so ago.  And once we start having those , those  
meetings, of course, I ’ll observe, you know, the long- standing practice of not talking about 
confidential discussions.  But as of now, there haven’ t been any discussions at all.  
MICHE LLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider, Reuters.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 28  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this.  So a couple questions 
on timing.  In the statement , you removed—regarding the c oronavirus —you removed the time 
reference “short and medium term ” when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook , and it 
simply now says “considerable risks to the economic outlook. ”  Should we read that as a sort of a 
positive change that you , you now see an end—sort of the endgame of this down the road?  Or is 
it more that you ’re, you’re  worried it could last longer than you expect?  And a related issue , 
have you given any guidance yet to the F ed staff or S ystem on whe n the F ed itself might resume 
in-person event s? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So in the statement, on the language, we dropped “ in the 
medium term, ” because , really, the risks are, are  in the near term, frankly.   You know, a s I 
mentioned, it ’s the rollout of the vaccine.  It ’s the arrival of new strains that, that  are more 
contagious and perhaps more virulent.  And those are the —those are the —and also just the 
ongoing—third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus.  It ’s, it’s in the near term .  It’s 
not in the medium term.  We were thinking —when we were thinking “ medium term, ” we were 
thinking of longer -term scarring and things like that.  
Nonetheless, I mean, I think what —to go to your , your  second question, and as I 
mentioned in my, in my  opening r emarks —there is good evidence to, to support a stronger 
economy i n the second half of this year.  In fact, if you look at , at—as we do —look at a range of 
private forecasters, what was their forecast in , in December , and what ’s their forecast now?  
Right ac ross the board :  much higher forecast s for 2021 growth.  And that ’s because of the 
ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations , and the reality of , 
of the CRR A Act [ Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done .  So there  is—there  is a 
positive case there.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 28  
 But that —think of that as —the sort of base case is, is  a strong economy in the second half 
of the year.  The language says that there’ s still —I forget the exact language —downside risks .  
We used an adjective.  It was “ considerable” —“considerable risk s to the economic outlook.”   So 
there are considerable risk s, risks to the economic outlook.  Nonetheless, that is —that is  a more 
positive outlook.  And that ’s really how , how  I would—I would parse that for you.  
I don’ t know when we ’re going to come back to work, and I ’m, I’m  actually in the Eccles 
Building here today.  And I don’ t know when that ’ll be.  I mean, we—I can ’t wait to be working 
in person again.  But , you know, we —we ’ve been able to work successfully remotely.  We really 
have .  And, you know, we ’re not going to push people when they’ re uncomfortable.  We’ re 
going to wait til l peopl e are comfortable and wait til l it’s well and truly time to get back together 
in person.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 
MICHEL LE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  The 
Fed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases.  And 
so I wanted to ask what factors the F ed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay 
out in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay .  So we ’re, we’re  monitoring that on an ongoing basis, 
continue to —continuing to evaluate our , our restrictions .  And we haven’ t made a decision about 
whether to continue them in the second quarter or not.  We ’re just going to look at ba nk—w e’re 
going to look at the whole range of , of information , including economic activity, banking 
activity, the , the success in vaccination.  All of those things will go into our assessment of what 
the right answer is to that question.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 28  
 I think we ’ve been careful about , about  rolling back those restrictions.  And, and I ’m 
pleased with where we are.  L et’s remember that the banks —that the banks that are subject to the 
stress tests have taken very, very large reserves— very large loss reserves, and also increa sed 
their capital .  They’ve actually had— they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the 
beginning of the pandemic.  So the banking system has held up well here.  And, and—but , you 
know, we ’re going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data , and all of the 
data, when we make that decision.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question.  So I ’m 
interested in the  housing sector.  Home prices are rising , 9 percent  in some areas, because of low 
interest rates.  Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet?  And is there a price 
increase, you know, that you’ re looking at where it might change the level of mortgage -backed 
securities the Fed  is buying?  And , as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt 
cycle more concerning for you?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on housing, you know, housing is now —the level of housing 
activity is at its highest level since  before the Global F inancial C risis, in some measures .  So 
we’ve had a very strong rebound in housing.  Some of the , the tightness in housing markets , we 
think—which has led to the , the significant price increases this year —we think is , is a passing 
phenomenon.  There was a lot of pent -up demand. 
There ’s a one- time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in 
their house, and they’ re thinking either “ I need a bigger house ” or “I need another house and a 
different house —or a second house ,” in some cases.  So there ’s just—there’s  a—there’s a one -
time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied —also , that will call for th supply.  And that 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 28  
 will—that will, we think —we  think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for , for 
all of those reasons.  
So you asked about corporate debt, I guess ?  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes.  I’m just concerned if that ’s a bubble that you’ re 
watching.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we , we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty 
carefully.  And , you know, what ’s happened in, in  the corporate debt market , beginning with the 
announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been , you’ ve seen lenders lending and 
borrowers borrowing.  You’ve seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we—than we  
expected.  There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning , and those have 
really slowed down. 
And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans.  Banks are no t experiencing the kinds of 
defaults that , that  we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic.  It ’s just not 
materializing.  So they’ re having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually.  
Debts —corporate debt spreads are, are  tight.   They ’ve tightened.  They were very 
broad—high —wide, of course, at the —during the acute phase of the pandemic , and they’ve —
you know, they’ re now at the lower end of their typical range.  And we do monitor that.  
You know, it ’s, it’s not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do—we 
do watch those things.  And, you know, in a sense, it ’s good that companies have been able to 
finance themselves during this period, because they—they’ ve been able to stay in business .  
They’ve been able to keep their employees working.  And , you know, that ’s a good thing.  And 
that’s, that’s  part of highly accommodative financial conditions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Chris Rugaber.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 28  
 CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thanks.  Can you—s ince you suggested that the concern 
from th e pandemic is perhaps a shorter -term concern and that ’s why you removed some of the 
language from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you ’re seeing so far?  
Do you feel that structural impacts have been —ho w would you characterize those?  I 
know that ’s been a major concern —you’ve talked about at this press conference and others.  Do 
we see longer -term damage to the job market?  Have—or has there been some success in 
preventing that?  And , compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage 
to the job market here , in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need 
to shift industries, that kind o f thing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, the , the, the big thing is that the jury ’s out.  And this has 
been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people —if, if they become 
disconnected from the industry or the job where —that they used to work in, it, it can be years or 
never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their 
careers—t he same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don’ t have the kind of resources 
that you need to get through this.  S o we ’ve, we’ve  had a big concern about , about  both of those.  
We haven ’t seen as much of it as we—as we feared.  And that ’s a good thing.  But as I 
said that, you know, the jury is out here —9 or 10  million people still out of work because of the 
pandemic.  They’re —a big chunk of them are people who worked in public -facing jobs in the 
service sector.  And, you know, they’ ve gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from 
monetary policy.  
But the question is getting them back to work.  And, you know, it ’s, it’s harder  if 
you’re —it takes longer , empirically , to find that next job if you’ re looking at a brand- new 
industry.  It’s not easy to change careers completely midcareer.  So that just, again, stresses the 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 28  
 urgency that we feel and others feel at,  at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the 
job a nd getting back to a place where it ’s safe to have these— you know, to, to , to stay in hotels, 
to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things. 
So those people are still at risk.  And we ’re, we’re  very, very focused on that group of 
people with our policy a nd, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy.  So many 
people have had that brid ge across the pandemic.  You know, we talked about that at the 
beginning.  For many people, it ’s clear that they ’ve made it across, a nd their job  is okay , and 
their house  is okay.  And, you know, it ’s been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are 
closed and things like that.  But there, there ’s a bunch of people yet who haven’ t found that 
bridge yet.  And we ’re, we’re  very focused on that.  
Of course, the other thing is, we ’re going to a diff erent economy.  And we ’re going to be 
learning more about that as we go.  But , clearly, we ’re, we’re  learning that things can be done 
from remote locations.  We’re learning that technology can replace people even more than we 
thought.  And some of that is happening. 
So I think as we, you know , as we get into this, you know, the phase after —even after the 
economy fully reopens, I think we ’re still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have 
been disrupted, because they ’ve lost that —the work that th ey did.  And I think it would be wise 
as a country, for the longer -run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for 
those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing 
support for an additional period of time.  
CHRIST OPHER RUGABER.  Great.  If I could as k this  quick follow —yesterday Susan 
Rice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said closing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the  U.S. economy over the next five 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 25 of 28  
 years and 6  million new jobs.  Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the 
economy?  And, if so, what can the Fed  do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and 
wealth, including potentially through regulatory policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I strongly agree  with that, as a matter of fact.   I think if you look at 
either—look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, 
homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even control ling for many other factors, 
you will see that they ’re, they’re  persistent , they’re —and they ’re very difficult to explain.  
And so it’s —the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is 
that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with , 
with—we want —we want  the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can 
possibly be.  We want —we want  an economy where everybody can take part a nd everybody, 
everybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy.  
That’s what we want.  And that ’s how the U .S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster, 
is if we can achieve a more —a broader prosperity. 
So, now , in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is 
one for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play.  And, and that is , how we think about the labor market.  Principally , whe n we say that the 
maximum employment is a , a broad and inclusive goal, what we ’re—what we’re  saying there is , 
we’re not just going to look at the headline —and we never did, really, b ut—we ’re not going to 
just look at the headline numbers.  We’re going to l ook at different demographic groups, 
including women, minorities , and others.  And we ’re not going to say that we ’ve reached 
maximum  employment, which is our statutory goal, until we ’ve reached maximum  employment.  
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 26 of 28  
 And you haven’t  if, if there ’s lots of po ckets of , of people not participating in or not employed in 
the labor market.  S o those are the things that we can do.  
We also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues.  You know, we  do—we, we  
have such a focus on these issues now that we actuall y—we , we have a new , a webpage, 
relatively new, where you can access all of it.  But it ’s a lot of activities in our Division of 
Consumer and Community Affairs.  It’s lots of research , and, and it ’s also, you know, our 
enforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that.  So I think everybody’ s got a role to 
play here.  It ’s a—it’s  a national goal and a national job, a nd we ’re just going to do our part of 
the job.  And it ’s something we ’re strongly committed to.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the last question, we ’ll go to Scott Horsley 
at NPR.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  You said in your opening remarks that the , 
the economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than  people  expected , and that that 
reflected the adaptability of both households and businesses.  Are, are there adaptations that 
caught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on- site work, in- person, 
face-to-face work that , that  the economy’ s proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset 
of this pandemic?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  S o I think, if you go back to the —to the beginning, there 
was a real concern.  I mean, just , just  take the financial markets, for example.  Suddenly, all of 
those big buildings all over the , the—New York City and all around the world where people 
work in the financial markets with terminals and everything , everybody had to go home, and 
they had to take their terminals with them.  And I think there was a real concern that there would 
be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 27 of 28  
 historically difficult conditions.  And yet, it worked out okay.  So I think pe ople—many people 
in the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading 
floors or on virtual trading floors.  
Now, some of that ’s reversing now.  But we have definitely learned that we can do more 
work from home in many, many different lines of work.  Of course, that ’s not possible if your 
job involves being at a place, doing personal services.  For many people, it ’s not possible.  And 
that’s very much something that skews to higher -income, higher -educated people being able to 
work from home and others not so much.  So I think we ’ve learned that.  
The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw  the wave in the S outh 
and the W est, the wave of cases this summer, I think , intuitively , having seen what happened in 
March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity.  And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and , and dealt with it.  And , and it didn’ t actually —it had 
a much smaller effect on ec onomic activity than we expected.  
Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger —a very, very large wave as , as 
was very much forecast.  People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that.  And even there, if 
you look at —I would say, look at the December jobs report.  So , big job losses in, you know, in 
that part of the service sector.  So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants .  There’s  
another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities.  But if you go —if you look elsewhere, it ’s not 
having an effect.  You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly —really directly —exposed to the pandemic in their 
economic activity, t hey’re doing okay.  T hey are.  
Housing is a great example.  You know, the way—the way —the way  the housing 
industry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in- person contact .  They managed 
January 27, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 28 of 28  
 to pretty much immediately go to a more virtual —you know, with all the technology.  They were 
able to completely a void that.  And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding 
that it’ s, it’s now quite virtual rather than in person. 
So there ’s been a lot of adapting, and—but you can’ t adapt, you know, hotels, sporting 
venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars .  You just —you know, those are just going to —and 
that’s—again , that’s millions and millions of people.  And so you’ re just going to have to defeat 
the pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we , we have a plan to do that, but we haven’ t 
done it yet . 
And we need to—we need to  finish the job.  And we —it’ s, it’s within our power to do 
that as a country this year.  And I would just urge that —and I know people are working hard on 
that.  But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is , is getting the pandemic under 
control, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks , and all that.  That ’s the 
single most important economic growth policy that we can have.  Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
March 17, 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  I would like to start by noting that it has been a full 
year since the pandemic arrived with force on our shores.  Looking back, it was clear that 
addressing a fast -moving global pandemic would be plainly and primarily the realm of health -
care providers and experts, and we are grateful to them and to all the essential workers for their service and sacrifice.  The danger to the U.S. economy  was also clear.  Congress provided by far 
the fastest and largest response to any postwar economic downturn, offering fiscal support for households, businesses, health -care providers, and state and local governments.  
Here at the Federal Reserve, we rapidl y deployed our full range of tools to provide relief 
and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy.  We are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that 
Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability.  
The economic fallout has been real and widespread, but with the benefit of perspective, 
we can say that some of the very worst economic outcomes have been avoided by swift and forceful action —from Congress, from across government, and in cities and towns across the 
country.  More people held on to their jobs, more businesses kept their doors open, and more incomes were saved as a result of these swift and forceful policy actions.  And while we welcome these positive developments, no one should be complacent.  At the Fed, we will 
continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.  
Today the FOMC kept interest rates near zero and maintained our sizable asset purchases.  
These meas ures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will 
ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.  
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL

 The path of the economy continues to depend significa ntly on the course of the virus and 
the measures undertaken to control its spread.  Since January, the number of new cases, 
hospitalizations, and deaths has fallen, and ongoing vaccinations offer hope for a return to more normal conditions later this year.   In the meantime, continued observance of social -distancing 
measures and wearing masks will help us reach that goal as soon as possible.  The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain. 
Following the moder ation in the pace of the recovery that began toward the end of last 
year, indicators of economic activity and employment have turned up recently, although the sectors of the economy most adversely affected by the resurgence of the virus and by greater social distancing remain weak.  Household spending on goods has risen notably so far this year.  
In contrast, household spending on services remains low, especially in services that typically require people to gather closely, including travel and hospitality.  The housing sector has more 
than fully recovered from the downturn, while business investment and manufacturing 
production have also picked up. 
The overall recovery in economic activity since last spring is due importantly to 
unprecedented fiscal and mone tary policy actions, which have provided essential support to 
households, businesses, and communities.  The recovery has progressed more quickly than 
generally expected, and forecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year have been revised u p notably since our December Summary of Economic Projections.  In commenting 
on the stronger outlook, participants noted progress on vaccinations as well as recent fiscal policy.  
As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have turned up recently.  
Employment rose by 379,000 in February, as the leisure and hospitality sector recouped about 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 30  
 two-thirds of the jobs that were lost in December and January.  Nonetheless, employment in this 
sector is more than 3 million below its level at the  onset of the pandemic.  For the economy as a 
whole, employment is 9.5 million below its pre -pandemic level.  The unemployment rate 
remains elevated at 6.2 percent in February; this figure understates the shortfall in employment, 
particularly as participat ion in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic levels.  
Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; 
the median projection is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and moves down to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.  The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the service sector and for African 
Americans and Hispanics.  The economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.  
Overall inflation remains below our 2 percent longer- run objective.  Over the next few 
months, 12- month measures  of inflation will move up as the very low readings from March and 
April of last year fall out of the calculation.  Beyond these base effects, we could also see upward pressure on prices if spending rebounds quickly as the economy continues to reopen, part icularly 
if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term.  However, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transient effects on inflation.  The median 
inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 perc ent this year and declines to 2 percent next 
year before moving back up by the end of 2023.  
The Fed ’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibil ities to 
promote the financial— the stability of the financial system.  As we say in our Statement on 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 30  
 Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a “broad-
based and inclusive goal.”  Our ability to achieve maximum employment  in the years ahead 
depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.  
As the Committee reiterated in today ’s policy statement, with inflation running 
persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for 
some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer -term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and i nflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, 
we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with th e 
Committee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on 
track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  I would note that a transitory rise in 
inflation above 2 percent, as seems likely to occur this year, would not meet this standard.  
In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least 
$80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per 
month until substantial further progress has been ma de toward our maximum -employment and 
price -stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since last March has materially eased 
financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.  The economy is a long way from our employment an d inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial 
further progress to be achieved.  
Our forward guidance for the federal funds rate, along with our balance sheet guidance, 
will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the recovery progresses.  Our guidance is outcome based and ties the path of the federal funds rate and the 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 30  
 balance sheet to progress toward reaching our employment and inflation goals.  Overall, our 
interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so. 
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recovery from this diff icult period will be as robust as possible.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
JOE PAVEL.  Howard from Reuters.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Chair Powell, and , and thanks for that.  So  could you talk 
us through how the , the forecasts for 2021 map into the “ substantial further progress ” 
definition —you know, 2.4 percent inflation—I  understand that ’s considered transitory.  That still 
seems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment .  Is it time to start talking about 
talking about tapering yet ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  [Laughter]  Not yet.  So, as you—as you pointed out, we ’ve said that 
we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress.  And that’s actual progress, not forecast progress.  So —and that ’s a difference from, from  our past 
approach.  So —and what we mean by that is , is pretty straightforward.  It is , we want to see that , 
that the labor markets have moved —labor market conditions have moved —you know, have 
made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal.  That ’s what we ’re going to want to see.  Now, that 
obviously includes an element of judgment.  And when we see—we ’ll be—we’ll be  carefully 
looking ahead. 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 30  
 We, we  also understand that we , we will want to provide as much advance notice of any 
potential taper as possible.  So when we see that we’ re on track, when we see actual data coming 
in that suggests that we ’re on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we ’ll say 
so.  And we ’ll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.   If, if  I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots —why 
wouldn’ t that suggest a weakening  of the commitment here ?  An awful lot of people shifted into 
2022, it seems.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I , I don’t see that at all.  You know, we , we have a , a range of 
perspectives on the Committee.  I welcome that.  And, you know, we , we have —we  debate 
things, we d iscuss things, and we always come together around a —around a, a  solution.  But, 
you know, the , the strong bulk of the Committee is , is not showing a rate increase during this 
forecast period.  And, you know, as , as data improve, as the outlook improves ver y significantly 
since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up.  It’ s probably not a 
surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff.  
Nonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee —the , the largest part by far of the 
Committee is, is—doesn ’t show a rate increase during this period.  And , again, part of that is 
wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point.  We do expect that we’ ll begin 
to make faster progress on both spending—you know, labor markets and inflation as the year 
goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we’ re 
getting.  We expect that to happen.  But, you know, we ’ll have to see it first.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Victoria . 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask about the supplementary 
leverage ratio.  You know, there ’s been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 30  
 month, which—I ’m happy to hear an update if you have one.   But just sort of more broadly, do 
you think, long  term , that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at 
a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large ?  And , if so, do you think the changes to 
the leverage ratio , inclu ding the SLR , are the way to deal with that problem ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Victoria, we ’ll have something to announce on that in coming days.  
And I ’m not going to expound upon your questions.  Why don’ t you—why don’t you ask 
another question if you’ d like to ?  Because, because that one —I’m just going to say that we ’ll 
have something in coming days. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Sure.  Okay.  Well, then I ’ll ask about unemployment.  You know, 
there ’s—the unemployment rate is —you all have projections for the U -6 rate, but you ’ve also 
been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that ’s not the only thing that you all are looking 
at.  You ’re also looking at labor force participation and things like that.  So are you all looking at 
ways of maybe adding to how you’ re projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of 
Economic P rojections ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me say, as we say in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals 
and M onetary P olicy S trategy, we look to a r ange of indicators on the labor market.   We never 
only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of , of labor market outcomes 
that’s in the SEP.  We look at a very broad range.  You hear us talk all the time about 
participation ; about em ployment to population, which is the combination of the two;  about 
different measures of, of  unemployment.  So it ’s wages, it ’s, it’s the job flows, it ’s, you know, all 
of those things .  They go into an assessment —disparities of various groups .  All that g oes into an 
assessment of maximum employment . 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 30  
 The, the —trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of E conomic P rojections 
would not be practical .  You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the 
unemployment rate , and that ’s a very insufficient statistic .  So—it, it  doesn’ t include a lot of 
other things that we —that we  do look at .  And I , I wouldn’ t want to say that we ’re looking to 
include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP .  But at time —from time to time, we 
do look at , at adding different things .  But I , I would just say the SEP  is, it’s a summary .  It’s one 
device .  It’s not going to include all of the things that we look at .  I think you know the things 
that we look at —we,  we talk about them all the time .  So we ’re not actually looking actively at 
significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast 
overall .  You ’re forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have 
inflation —or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, 
yet no rate hike in any of this —in any of this forecast horizon .  So is this telling us that we could 
see a higher inflation rate than was projected ?  Or do you not —as you’ ve been talking about, is 
the unemployment rate insufficient?  Or what is this telling us about the Fed’ s reaction function, 
that it seems you ’re meeting the Fed ’s dual mandate by 2023, yet , again , no rate hike  expected ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So I guess the first thing to say is that the , the SEP is not a 
Committee forecast .  It’s, it’s not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, 
and say , “This represent s our, you know, our reaction function as a C ommittee .”  It’s a 
compilation of projections from different people .  And I —since we don ’t debate it or discuss it, it 
would be hard for me to say why —exactly why each participant did what they were going to do.  
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 30  
 So all I would say about this is that we ’ve—we  laid out what I think is very clear 
guidance on liftoff .  And it ’s really three things:  labor market conditions that are consistent with 
our estimates of maximum employment—a nd, as I mentioned, we consider a  wide range of 
indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate ; inflation that has 
reached 2  percent, and not just on a transitory basis ; and inflation that ’s on track to run 
moderately above 2 percent for some time .  The fi rst two of those three are very much data 
based;  the third does have a little bit of a—of an element of expectations in it .  So we are very 
much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way.  It is the guidance that we chose 
carefully to implement our new framework .  And to meet these standards , we’ll need to see data, 
as I mentioned . 
So what does —what does  this, this SEP really say ?  It says that we’ re committed to our 
framework and to the guidance we ’ve provided to implement that framework .  We will wait until 
the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our 
policy rate .  And the last thing I ’ll say is this:   The state of the economy in two or three years is 
highly uncertain, a nd I woul dn’t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate 
increase that far into the future .  So that ’s how I would think about the, the SEP. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Paul Kiernan . 
PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you, Chairman Powell .  My question is tw ofold.  One, how 
high are you comfortable letting inflation rise ?  There , there  is some ambiguity in, in your new 
target, as you mentioned, “ expectations driven .”  And, and do you think that that ambiguity 
might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby 
causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely?  Is that a concern ?  Thanks . 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 30  
 CHAIR POWELL .  So we ’ve said we’ d like to see inflation run moderately above 
2 percent for some time .  And we ’ve resisted, ba sically, generally, the temptation to try to 
quantify that .  Part of that just is , talking about inflation is one thing;  actually having inflation 
run above 2 percent is the real thing.  So I—you know, over the years we ’ve, we’ve  talked about 
2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven ’t achieved it .  So I , I would say we ’d like to, you 
know, perform .  That ’s what we ’d really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 
2 percent . 
I don’ t want to be too specific about what tha t means, because I think it ’s hard to do that .  
And we haven’ t done it yet .  You know, when we ’re actually above 2 percent, we can do that .  
I—look, I , I would say this .  The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we’re not 
going to act preemp tively based on forecasts for the most part .  And we ’re going to wait to see 
actual data.  And I think it will take people time to , to adjust to that —and to adjust to that new 
practice.  And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it .  So that ’s 
how I would think about that . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Matthew Boesler . 
MATTHEW BOESLER .  Hi, Chair Powell.  This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg 
News .  So there ’s a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S . will reach herd immunity 
sometime this year .  And all along, you’ ve said that the path of the economy is going to be 
determined by the course of the virus .  I’m curious, based on the projections that you released 
today that show unemployment will still be above  estimates of maximum employment through 
the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be 
doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will?  Thank you. 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 30  
 CHAIR POWELL .  So, on, on herd immunity, I, I’m really going to leave that question 
to the experts .  We don’ t control that.  We’ re not responsible for defining it .  And we ’ll, we’ll 
leave that whole discussion to the experts .  I mean, we’re —what we ’re focused on is , is the part 
that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy.  And there we ’ve provided 
very clear guidance.  And in the case of asset purchases, it ’s at their current level until we make 
substantial further progress .  There is an element of j udgment in that , and we ’ll, we’ll—
therefore , we’ll  supply clear communication well in advance of , of actually tapering, and we just 
went through, you know, the , the criteria for raising interest rates .  They ’re very specific.  And, 
you know, we ’re, we’re  very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly.  
I, I would agree with you that the , the path of the virus continues to be very important .  
We, we  have these, you know, new strains with —which , which can be quite virulent .  And we ’re 
not actually done yet .  And I, I —we ’re clearly on a good path with, with  cases coming down, as I 
mentioned, but we ’re not done .  And I ’d hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we 
actually finish the job.  So that ’s how I would look at that . 
MATTHEW BOESLER .  If I could just briefly follow up , how do you see sort of the 
disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full 
employment taking longer to achieve ?  Is it , is it the case that factors related to the virus will still 
be with us over the coming years ?  Is that how to interpret the forecasts ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  I think there ’s some of that .  Sure, there ’ll be some of that.  There 
will still be some social distancing .  People may be, for example, going in to spaces that, that , you 
know, that involve close contact with others .  Some people will do that right away.  Others will 
hold back.  And so I think there ’ll—there’ll be some of that . 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 30  
 In addition, though, remember, there are —there are 10 million people —in the range of 
10 million people who need to get back to work.  And it ’s going to take some time for that to 
happen.  You know, it can—it can  happen maybe , maybe  more quickly than it has in the past, 
because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating 
aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers .  This could be a 
different sort of a process .  And it co uld be quicker .  We don ’t know that .  But it’ s, it’s just a lot 
of people who have —who need to get back to work.  And it ’s not going to happen overnight .  It 
would be —it’s going to take some time .  No matter how well the economy performs, 
unemployment will  take quite a time to go —to go  down, and so will participation.  So that ’s all I 
can say .  I think the faster the better;  we’d love to see it come sooner rather than later.  We’d 
welcome nothing more than that .  But , realistically, given the numbers, it ’s going to take 
some  time . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you, Steve Liesman . 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  I wonder if you could—kind of a three -
parter here, but all related .  Would you comment on the current level of the 10- year yield and 
some other lo ng rates out there , whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on 
the economy?  And , if not, is there a level that would give you concern?  And, finally, the third 
part:  Other central bankers have expressed concern about what ’s happened to yields in their 
countries and even some taken action, but not you .  Could you give us your general idea or 
orientation towards the idea of , of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the 
bond market ?  Do —do you like that idea ?  Do you not like it ?  Is it at the top of your toolbox, or 
is it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox?

 CHAIR POWELL .  Sure .  So we m onitor a broad range of financial conditions , and 
we’re always attentive to market developments, of course .  We’re still a long way from our 
goals , and it’s important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the 
achievement of those goa ls.  And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what 
you’ll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly 
accommodative .  And that is appropriate .  So that ’s, that’s  how we look at it . 
I would add, as I ’ve said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by 
a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals .  We 
think the stance of our —of monetary policy remains appropriate .  Our guidance on the federal 
funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy.  And we ’re 
committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and 
truly  done . 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Could , could you give us an idea of how you sort of  feel about that 
tool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating— doing an 
Operation T wist or something like that?  Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox 
or something that you don’ t really prefer?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we —the tools we have are the tools we have.  What I ’m 
telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe , is appropriate .  We 
think that our asset purchases in their current form —which is to say, you know, across the curve , 
$80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage -backed securities on net —we think that that ’s, 
that’s  the right place for our asset purchases.  Now , we can —we can  change them, of course, in, 
in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that’ s appropriate .  But , for now, we 
think that our policy stance on that is appropriate .

 MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel . 
RACHEL SIEGEL .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks very much for taking my question.  
You’ve spoken about the pa ndemic ’s disproportionate toll on B lack Americans, Hispanic 
Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market .  And I ’m curious if you can 
speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have 
persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans .  And, relatedly, since 
you’ve described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower 
vaccination rates in communities of color?  And what barriers do you think exist there?  Thanks very much.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, which measures.  So we, we do monitor and communicate very 
regularly about different labor market—disparities in the labor market, let ’s say .  So the African 
American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment 
rate.  So we look at those and we see those as, you know —it’ s, it’s slack in the labor market.  
It’s, it’s sad to see, because those disparities had real ly come down to record lows since we 
started keeping the data that way .  As recently as a year ago , February of last year, we had those , 
those  disparities quite low .  What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the 
speed of white unemploym ent.  So we monitor those things . 
We—our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we ’re going to look at 
those as, as  a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that  there ’s progress 
there .  And , and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on , on a part of the 
economy that employs many minorities and lower -paid workers .  The public -facing workers in 
the service industries in many cases don ’t have a lot of financial assets , they’re not tremendously 
well paid , they might have other jobs , and things like that .  So this was a direct hit on that part of 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 30  
 the economy.  And it ’s the slowest part of the economy to recover .  So, you know, we ’d like to 
see those people continue to get supported, you know, as  we—as the br oader economy recovers, 
which , which it’ s very much doing now . 
In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that’s —those are facts and unfortunate facts.  
They ’re really not something we , we have within our policy toolkit to address .  But it is —it is  
true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are —there are significant disparities 
between different ethnic groups and —you know, but that ’s, that’s  not for us .  That ’s for fiscal 
authorities and the government more generally to, to  work on. 
MIC HELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek . 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chair Powell .  Thanks for taking our questions .  I was 
wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come 
down the line affecting the economy ’s potential in the  longer term, just in the sense that you’ ve 
talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our , sort 
of, future prospects .  And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse .  You know, 
if we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to 
avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning.  And I think that ’s just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered—you know, with the 
CARES Act and since then, has —is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full 
employment .  It’s going to make a huge difference in people ’s lives .  And it has already. 
As I mentioned in my remarks —opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we 
expected .  Part of that just is , it’s very hard to predict, given we ’ve never seen an event like this.  
But part of it is just the strength of th e fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 30  
 years.  Longer  term, you know, to, to really —that’s —the first part of it is about avoiding 
scarring, and I think we ’ve not avoided all of the scarring , but we ’ve probably avoided the worst 
cases there.  And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course , to 
do whatever we can to make sure that’s —that continues . 
Longer  term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour 
worked, to rai se living standards over time, is investment :  investment in people ’s skills and 
aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software .  It takes a lot of investment 
to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards .  And t hat’s —you know, 
that hasn’ t been the principal focus with these measures—our measures, certainly .  And w e don’ t 
have those tools .  But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and 
beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal .  But there should be a 
focus on—a longer -term focus , I think , would be healthy on, on the investment front . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  James Politi . 
JAMES POLITI .  Thank you, Chair Powell .  I wanted to ask a question about the e uro 
zone .  While the outlook for the U.S . economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has 
been far less encouraging .  And it ’s showing signs of serious weakness due , due  to the slower 
vaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions .  How worried are you about 
transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that , that  trouble in the e uro zone  and 
weakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way , in the 
aftermath of the financial crisis ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You ’re right that the pace of the recovery is that we ’re having 
diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis.  And in this case, as well as the other 
one, the U.S.’ s recovery is, is  leading the global recovery.  And, you know, we conduct policy, 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 30  
 of course, here .  Our , our focus is on —our, you know —our, our objectives are domestic ones.  
It’s, it’s maximum employment and price stability here in the United States .  We monitor 
developments abroad, and we know —because they know we know that they can —those can 
affect our outcomes .  So I think U.S. demand—very strong U.S . demand, if, if—as the economy 
improves is going to support global activity as well over time .  That, that ’ll be through imports .  
And, you know, when the U.S . economy is strong, that strength tends to be —tends to support 
global , global  activity as well.  So that ’s one thing. 
I don’ t—I don’t  worry in the near term.  I mean, I ’d love to see Europe growing faster .  
I’d love to see the vacci ne rollout going more smoothly.  But I don’ t worry too much about us in 
the near term, because we’ re, we’re  on a very good track.  Very strong fiscal support coming, 
now vaccination going quickly, a nd cases coming down .  I think we ’re—I think we’re  in a good 
place.  It’s all ahead of us , but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain 
strong for some time here . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions .  I wanted to ask if the  
Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases —
I’m sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter , and if you’ re 
considering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests t hat were in place last year, this 
year.  And , kind of , what would make you consider doing something like that again?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So we haven’ t made a decision on that .  We’ re a couple weeks away 
from announcing that decision.  I , I won’t foreshadow it here today.  I will say , we’re going to 
continue our data -driven approach.  You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends , so the 
firms are preserving capital .  Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 30  
 and their level of reserves.  And the December stress test s showed that banks are strong and well 
capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we—that we  used in December, which were 
quite stringent . 
We’re right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests , and we ’ll release those results before 
the end of June .  And that layer s, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress 
the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 
11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent .  So—but all of that, you know, the 
results of the stress test s and the decision on distributions —all of that is to come fairly soon, as I 
mentioned.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions .  You laid 
out the standards to lift off.  And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you’ re not even 
thinking about thinking about raising rates .  But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4 
next year .  How, how  much debate —and how can you characterize that conversation —has there 
been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, you know, it all depends .  We’ ve set out very clear criteria for 
liftoff, right,  where we’ ve said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with 
our estimates of, of  maximum employment .  And that doesn’ t just mean unemployment, it means 
a much broader set of criteria .  We want inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transitory basis .  And  
we want inflation on track to be moderately —to run moderately above 2 percent for some time .  
Those are the three conditions .  Everybody on the C ommittee agrees to that, right?  
So it comes down to, what ’s your projection for the economy ?  If you want to—i f you 
want to —you know, people will have a range of , of assessments for how good the economy is 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 30  
 going to be .  And, you know, we , we don’ t—I would say that we ’re in a relatively highly 
uncertain situation.  If you look at the uncertainty, people , people  on the Committee broadly say 
that uncertainty about the forecast is , is very high compared to the normal level .  We haven ’t 
come out of a pandemic before .  We haven ’t had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all 
up.  So you’ re going to have differe nt perspectives from C ommittee participants about how fast 
growth will be, how fast the labor market will hea l, or how fast —sorry, inflation will move up.  
And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff . 
Of course, thi s isn’t a decision to lift off now .  We ’ll make that decision then .  But it ’s an 
estimate based on —based on assumptions about growth.  And it ’s, it’s meant to be a tool to 
generally show the public how , how  our objective function works, how we think about the 
future .  It isn ’t meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off.  We—you 
know, we ’re not going to make that decision for some time .  The  chances are that the economy in 
that time  and place will be very different from the one we think it ’ll be. 
So I—sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they— they’re not a 
Committee forecast .  And you know this, but it’s—they’ re not a C ommittee forecast .  It’s just 
compiling t hese projections, really , of individual people .  We think it serves a useful purpose .  
It’s not meant to , to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the C ommittee will act.  
That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Brian Cheung. 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hey there, Chairman Powell .  I wanted to elaborate a little bit on 
your commentary about the fiscal stimulus .  So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even 
maybe mor e investment, at least from Congress , to support the more productive economy, as you 
answer ed to Jeanna’s question.  So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending.  So where do 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 30  
 you see the fiscal space right now ?  Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right 
now where it wouldn’ t be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, Brian, it ’s not up to us to decide what , what  Congress should 
spend money on or when.  I was answering Jeanna’s question, which r eally was, how do we 
assure lack of damage to —scarring , for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of 
the economy?  And I think what ’s happened so far has done a pretty good job of that .  But, 
really, I wanted to make the longer -run point th at if—to work on the productivity—on 
productivity  over longer periods, that is—that is —comes down to a number of things .  But one 
of those things is investment :  investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of 
those things . 
I’m not in an y way suggesting that that ’s something Congress should work on right now .  
Or that, you know, that ’s just not my—that’s not our job.  I ’m just saying , that, that is what fiscal 
policy can do that , really , monetary policy can’ t do—is, is invest in the future productive 
capacity of the economy, raise potential growth .  Those things are completely tools that Congress 
has.  And , again, I wasn ’t making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  N ext to Michael Derby . 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  I just wanted to get your—an 
updated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see 
any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either , you know,  specifically to 
that, that area of the market or as in terms of, like , the threat that it could p ose to—propose to the 
overall economy. 
CHAIR POWELL .  Sure.  So, as you know, financial stability for us is , is a framework .  
It’s not one thing.  It ’s not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that.  It’s a 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 30  
 framework that we , we have .  We report on it semiannually, t he Board gets a report on it 
quarterly, and we monitor every day.  And it has —it has  four pillars , and those are four key 
vulnerabilities:  asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and 
leverage among financial institutions .  Those four things .  And I’ll just quickly touch on them . 
So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset 
valuations are elevated compared to history.  I think that’ s clear .  In terms of households and 
businesses, households entered the , the crisis in very good shape by historical standards .  
Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the —since the financial crisis .  Now, there was— there was some negative effects on 
that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing , but they ’ve also gotten a lot of support now .  So 
the damage hasn ’t been as , as bad as we thought .  Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt 
load coming in.  And —but —and many saw their revenues decline.  But there’s— they’ve done so 
much financing, and there ’s a lot of cash on their balance sheet .  So nothing in those two sectors 
really jumps out as really troubling.  
Short term —I mentioned funding risk as the —as the last one.  So we saw , again, in this 
crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short -term funding markets —came under a tremendous amount 
of stress.  And they’ ve been quiet since the spring .  And , you know, we shut down our facilities 
and all  of that.  But we , we don’ t—we don’t  feel like we can let the moment pass without just 
saying again that we —that those —some aspects of the short -term funding markets and , more  
broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn’ t hold up so well under great stress —under 
tremendous stress .  And we need to go back and look at that .  So a very high priority for us as 
regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back—and this , this  will involve all the other 
regulatory agencies ; it does involve  all of them as well—and see if we can strengthen those 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 30  
 things .  So that ’s, that’s  a—sort of a broader , detailed look.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Michael McKee. 
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Mr. Chair man, can you help me understand something about the , 
the SEP and your forecasts ?  The inflation that you’ re talking about for this year , you say, is 
“transitory .”  Then , by 2023, you’ re back down to 2.1 percent .  There ’s no forecast for a rate 
increase for  2023.  If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 
2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there —or, roughly zero 
going forward from there ?  In other words, could we be in a Japan- like situation where  rates just 
stay low because inflation does ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, again , I wouldn’ t read too much into, into the, the March 2021 
SEP dot plot .  Remember what it is :  It’s a compilation of individual projections by individual 
members .  They ’re all making different assessments.  They , they have different forecasts, 
economic forecasts.  Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic.  And  they’re —also 
remember that the SEP doesn ’t actually include all the things that go into maximum 
employment .  Right ?  It’s, it’s only —it only includes unemployment . 
So I, I would just say, we ’ve set out clear guidance .  The —the message from the SEP that 
I would like to leave with people is , we set out clear guidance .  I mentioned what it was .  It’s 
inflation up t o—no, sorry, it ’s, it’s labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of 
maximum employment —and that ’s not just unemployment, it ’s all the other indicators, but , 
overall, totaling up to maximum employment ; it’s inflation at 2 percent , and not on a transient 
basis;  and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for —moderately for some time .  Those are the 
criteria .  We ’re committed to robustly implementing that guidance . 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 30  
 And that ’s what this —that’s what this  says.  T hat’s really all it says .  We ’re going to wait 
until those requirements are met.  And , again, you know, the , the state of the economy in two or 
three years is highly uncertain .  And I wouldn’ t want to focus too much on the exact timing of a 
potential rate increase that far in to the future . 
MICHAEL MCKEE .  If I could follow up , I’m just wondering—before 2019, I would 
say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low .  Now are you saying 
we’re willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get—meet your  goal on 
maximum employment ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So what I would say is , we’re committed to giving the economy the 
support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and 
price stability .  And, you know, to the extent having r ates low and support for monetary policy 
broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it ’s absolutely essential to maintain the 
strength and stability of the —of the  broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial 
stability quest ions if that ’s what you’ re getting at .  You know, we , we do that .  We wi ll—we  
monitor them very carefully . 
I, I would point out that , over the long expansion —the longest in U.S . history, 10 years 
and 8 months —rates were very low  for—they were at zero for, you know, 7 years a nd then—and 
then never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly.  During that , we didn’ t see, actually , 
excess buildup of debt .  We didn’ t see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the 
progress of the economy.  We didn’ t see the things you—we didn’ t see a housing bubble .  You 
know, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn’ t see them build up despite very low rates .  Part of that just is that you’ re in a low -
rate environment, you ’re in a much lower rate environment , and the  connection between low 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 30  
 rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is . 
That’s not to say we ignore it .  We don ’t ignore it.  We, we  watch it very carefully .  And 
we don’t think—we think there is a connection.  We say there is, but it ’s not quite so clear .  We 
actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully.  And we didn’ t do that 
before the Global F inancial C risis 12 years ago .  Now we do .  And we ’ve also, you know, put a 
lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our 
financial system—are much stronger, much more resilient.  That ’s true of the ban ks.  I think it ’s 
true of the CCPs .  We want it to be true of , of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets , 
and, and institutions . 
So I think that ’s, that’s —you know, monetary policy should be , to me , for, for achieving 
our macroeconomic aims .  Fina ncial regulatory policy and supervision should be for 
strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of 
things that it couldn’ t, frankly—a nd we learned that in 2008, ’09, ’10.  This time around, the 
regulated  part of the financial system held up very well .  We, we  found some other areas that 
need strengthening, and that ’s what we ’re working on now . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Anneken, CNN . 
ANNEKEN TAPPE .  Thanks for taking my question.  Chair man Powell, could you talk 
to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in , in inflation ?  Does the former offset the latter to some degree ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  I’m sorry, could you repeat that ?  You broke up t here for a second . 
ANNEKEN TAPPE .  Oh, no, I was hoping that wouldn’ t happen .  Can you hear me now ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes, ye s. 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 30  
 ANNEKEN TAPPE .  Okay, great .  I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about 
the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in 
inflation .  I’m wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are 
monitoring this . 
CHAIR POWELL .  You ’re asking about the relationship between unemployment and 
inflation ?  Is that— is that the question?  
ANNEKEN TAPPE .  Yes, exactly . 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ok ay. 
ANNEKEN TAPPE.  If they offset each other— the persistent pandemic unemployment . 
CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s, I think I ’m hearing you correctly.  So I would say a couple 
things .  There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and 
inflation .  That time is long gone .  We had extremely low unemployment  in, in—not extremely 
low.  We had low unemployment in 2018 and ’ 19 and the beginning of ’20 without having 
troubling inflation at all.  We were at 3.5 percent .  We were bouncing around with 
unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent .  And it wasn ’t just unemployment.  Participation was 
high, wages were moving up.  It was a very healthy thing.  And we didn’ t see price inflation 
move up.  
There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment .  But that has not —
what , what  happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have 
been absorbing that increase into their margins rather tha n raising prices .  And that seems to be a 
feature of late -cycle behavior .  So we’re, we ’re not —when , when we —when we  seek to achieve 
low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation. 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 30  
 MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Going to Greg Robb. 
GREG ROBB.  Hi .  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to follow up a little bit .  I, I 
understand what you’ re saying about the dot plot and, and the  message you ’re trying to send with 
the dot plot .  But does the same apply for the taper tantrum ?  You’ve said that it ’s going to take 
“some time ” to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like “ some  time” 
could now be any time . 
CHAIR PO WELL.  S o we ’ve said “substantial further progress .”  Now, if you go back, 
October, November —sorry, November, December , and January, progress in the labor market 
slowed very sharply.  So  you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month.  If you go back and look 
at the , the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high—very high.  So we weren ’t 
making any progress on the labor market from November through January.  February, we saw a 
nice—a nice  pickup, a good jobs report —379,465 private sector .  So that ’s good.  It can go so 
much higher, though. 
And, and, you know, it would be nice to see —to really make faster progress that ’s 
different from substantial progress , we’d like to see it be, be higher than that .  And I think it will 
be.  That’s —the expectation is , you ’ll see now , I think , really strong job creation return —not as 
high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but , 
nonetheless, very stro ng. 
Okay .  So what , what  I’m saying is , to achieve substantial progress from where we are, 
having had three months of , of very little progress, is going to take some time .  And it’s —we 
don’t want to get into —I don’ t want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace, 
because it ’s going to be data  dependent .  When we see—when we see ourselves on track to make 
substantial further progress, we ’re going to—we’re going to say so .  We understand fully that 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 30  
 that test is one that involves judgment . 
If you remember, during the G lobal F inancial C risis recovery, we said quantitative 
easing , number three , was —the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor 
market.  Well, what does that mean?  Well, it means a substantial improvement in  the outlook for 
the labor market.  It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that .  This is just 
like that, in a way .  What we ’re saying is , substantial further progress toward our goals .  We ’ll 
tell people when we think—until we —until we  say—until we give a signal, you can assume 
we’re not there yet.  And as we approach it , well in advance —well in advance—we will give a 
signal that , yes, we ’re on a path to, to  possibly achieve that, to consider tapering.  
So that ’s, that’s  how we ’re planning to handle it .  It’s not different, really , from, from  
QE3.  And I think we ’ve learned —what we ’ve learned from the experience of these last dozen 
years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly , well in advance, and then follow through 
with, with  your communications .  In this case, it ’s, it’s an outcome -based set of guidance, as our 
rate guidance  is, and it’s going to depend on the progress of the economy.  That’s why it ’s not 
appropriate to star t pointing at dates yet . 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Don Lee , L.A. Times . 
DON LEE .  Hi, Chair Powell.  As you know, households , households  are sitting on a lot 
of excess savings.  And I wonder if , combined with that , you have an unl eashing of, you know, 
pent-up demand.  How much do you think that would affect —that would affect  inflation ?  And 
would you expect that to be transitory?  
CHAIR POWELL .  We, you know, we and everyone who’ s forecasting these—what , 
what  we’re all doing is , we are looking at the —at the  amount of savings .  We’re looking at —you 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 30  
 know, we have reasonably good data on that .  And we ’re looking at the government transfers 
that’ll be made as part of the various laws.  And we ’re trying to make an assessment on what w ill 
be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume .  And from 
that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and , 
ultimately , on inflation .  So that ’s, that’s  what we ’re all doing . 
And we have, you know, we have —we can look at history, and we can make estimates, 
and those are all very transparent and public .  And you can compare one to the other .  And, of 
course, we ’ve all —we’ve all  done that .  And I think we ’ve made very conservative assumptions 
and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process.  And what , what  it comes 
down to is what I said before, which is , there very likely will be a step -up in inflation as March 
and April of last year drop out of the 12- month window, because they were very low inflation 
numbers .  That ’s a— that’ll be a fairly significant pop in inflation .  It’ll wear off quickly , though, 
because it —just the way the numbers are calculated . 
Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending mor e, and then, you know, 
you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner .  And so —
and they’ re not doing that now .  They ’re not going to restaurants, not going to theaters .  That part 
of the economy—and travel and hotels —that part of the economy is , is really not functioning at , 
at full capacity, right?  But as that happens, people can start to spend .  It’s also—wouldn’ t be 
surprising if —and you’ re seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy—there ’ll be 
bottlenecks.  They won’ t be—they won’t be  able to service all of the demand maybe , maybe  for 
a period.  So those things could lead to—and we ’ve, we’ve  modeled that .  Other people have too.  
We’ve—and w hat we see is relatively modest increases in inflation .  So—but those are not 
permanent things . 
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 30  
 You know, what ’ll, what’ll  happen is —the supply side —the supply side  in the United 
States is very dynamic .  People start businesses, they , they reopen restaurants, you know, the 
airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen.  And so it ’ll turn out to be a 
one—a one -time sort of bulge in , in prices, but it won’ t change inflation going forward, because 
inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent .  We know that inflation dynamics 
do evolve over time .  And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up.  
And, and that time is not now .  That hasn ’t been the case for some decades.  And we think it 
won’t —it won’t—we won ’t suddenly change to another regime . 
These things tend to change over time .  And they tend to— tend to change when the 
central bank doesn ’t understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the 
key to it all .  The, the —having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ab ility to push 
hard when the economy ’s really weak .  If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 
2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that 
didn’ t happen.  We’ re committed to having inflation ex pectations anchored at 2 percent, not 
materially above or below 2 percent . 
So that ’s—I think  if you —if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that ’s, 
that’s  kind of what comes out of our assessment .  There are different possibilities .  I think it ’s, 
it’s a relatively unusual —very unusual situation to have all these savings  and this , this  amount of 
fiscal support and monetary policy support .  Nonetheless, that , that  is our most likely case .  And 
you know, as the —as the data come in  and the economy performs , we’ll of course adjust .  Our 
outcome -based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of 
the economy is.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Scott Horsley for the last question.  
March 17, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 30 of 30  
 SCOTT HORSLEY .  Thanks, Chairman Powell .  My question is about those supply 
chain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side .  Are they getting better , or are they getting 
worse ?  We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we —that came 
out yesterda y.  And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in—just in the short run?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I have to say, I think it ’s impossible to say , frankly , with 
any confidence, but I , I would expect it ’s very possible —let’s put it that way —that you will see 
bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time.  And you’ ll probably see that over a period of time, 
because, you know, really, the , the strong data are ahead of us .  You know, you’re, you’re —right 
now the,  the checks are going out just , just  now .  And t hat’ll, that’ll add to spending.  COVID 
cases are coming down .  Vaccination is moving , now, quickly.  You know, the , the really strong 
economic data is coming .  It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track.  And that ’s when 
you’ll really know where , where  the bottlenecks are.  
But you can see, though, that they’ re not —these are not permanent .  It’s not like the 
supply side will be unable to adapt to these things .  It will—t he market will clear.  It just may 
take some time.  And , and some of the answer to that may be price .  In many cases, it won ’t be 
price .  You ’ll see that people are reluctant to raise prices .  You know, it ’s a little bit the story 
about, you know, the wage —the wage  Phillips curve  does show that as unemployment goes 
down, wages move up.  But companies choose not to try to, to  pass that , that  price increase along 
to their customers .  So you’ ll see a lot of that here too, I think .  Anyway, we ’ll, we’ll  see.  But 
that’s, that’s  my basic , basic sense.  Thank you very much.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  
April 28 , 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today my colleagues on the FOMC and I kept interest rates near zero and maintained our 
sizable ass et purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on 
our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the economy until the recovery is complete.  
Widespread vaccinations, alo ng with unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also 
providing strong support to the recovery.  Since the beginning of the year, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.  Household spending on goods has risen 
robustly.  The  housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, while business 
investment and manufacturing production have also increased .  Spending on services has also 
picked up, including at restaurants and bars .  More generally, the sectors of the economy m ost 
adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have show n improvement.  While the 
recovery has progressed more quickly than generally expected, it  remains uneven and far from 
complete.  
The path of the economy continues to depend significantly on the course of the virus and 
the measures undertaken to control its spread.  Since March, progress on vaccinations ha s limited 
the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.  While the lev el of new cases remain s 
concerning, especially as it reflect s the spread of more infectious strains of the virus , continued 
vaccinations should allow for a return to more normal economic conditions later this year.   In the 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 29  
 meantime, continued observance of  public health and safety guidance  will help us reach that goal 
as soon as possible.  
As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to 
improve .  Employment rose 916,000 in March , as the leisure and hospitality sector poste d a 
notable gain for the second consecutive month.  Nonetheless, employment in this sector is still 
more than 3 million below its level at the onset of the pandemic.  For the economy as a whole, 
payroll employment is 8.4 million below its pre -pandemic level.  The unemployment rate 
remain ed elevated at 6 percent in March , and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, 
particularly as participation in the labor market remains notably below pre -pandemic levels.  
The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to 
shoulder the burden have been the hardest hit.  In particular, the high level of joblessness has been especially severe for lower -wage workers in the service sector and for African Americans 
and Hispanics.  T he economic dislocation has upended many lives and created great uncertainty 
about the future.  
Readin gs on i nflation have increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before 
moderating.  In the near term, 12- month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 
2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic  fall out of the calculation  and past 
increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices .  Beyond these effects, we are also 
likely to  see upward pressure o n prices from the rebound in spending as the economy continues 
to reopen, particularly if supply bottlenecks limit how quickly production can respond in the near term.  However, these one -time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory  effects on 
inflation.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 29  
 The Fed ’s response to this crisis has been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to 
promote the stability of the financial system.  As we say in our Stat ement on Longer -Run Goals 
and Monetary Policy Strategy, we view maximum employment as a broad- based and inclusive 
goal.  Our ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer -term inflation expectations well anch ored at 2 percent.  
As the Committee reiterated in today ’s policy statement, with inflation running 
persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and lo nger-term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range 
for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the 
Committee ’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on 
track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  I would note that a transitory rise in 
inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet this standard.  
In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least 
$80 bill ion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities by at least $40 billion per 
month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum -employment and 
price -stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since March 2020 has mater ially eased 
financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the economy.  The economy is a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 29  
 Our guidance for interest rates and asset p urchases ties the path of the federal funds rate 
and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals.  This outcome -based 
guidance will ensure that the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative as the 
recovery progresses.  
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to c omplete the recovery .  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  First we ’ll go Paul K iernan. 
PAUL KIERNAN.   Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for doing this.  I guess , since I ’m first, 
I’ll go ahead and re -up Howard ’s question from the last press conference :  Is it time to start 
talking about talking about tapering yet?  Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to 
this effect?   Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So, no, i t is not time yet.  We ’ve said that we would let 
the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we ’d do that well in 
advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so.  In the meantime, we’ll be monitoring progr ess toward our goals.  We first articulated this “substantial further 
progress ” test at our December meeting.  Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked 
up after slowing over the winter.   And it will take some time before we see substantial fu rther 
progress.  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Jonnelle at Reuters.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 29  
 JONNELLE MARTE.  Okay.  Hi.  Thank you so much.  My question is about what ’s 
going on with the virus , and what if we don’ t reach a level of herd immunity, per se .  So, in your 
scenario , thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you 
might start to still normalize policy even if there ’s like a baseline of infection still going on?  Or 
how can you, you know, talk about how you’ re weighing those things?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s, so w e have to leave questions about herd immunity and what 
that looks like to the health experts, but , but I would certainly say that what matters the most to 
the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus.  The economy can’ t fully recover 
until people are confident that it ’s safe to resume activities involving crowds of people.  There 
may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won’ t come back in unless they 
feel really comfortable going bac k to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of 
the economy that will —that just won ’t be able to , to really fully reengage until the pandemic is 
decisively behind us.  
But, you know, we ’ve articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and 
for lifting off and raising interest rates.   So for , for asset purchases, we’ ve said that we w ould 
continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward 
our goals.  So —and that is , that is  what  it is, substantial further progress.  For interest rates, as 
I—as I  said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum 
employment , we want to see inflation at 2  percent , and we want to see it on track to exceed 
2 percent .  So those are our tests.  We don’ t have an independent test to do with the virus.  I will 
say, though, as I —as I  started with, you know, the , the path of the virus is going to have an effect 
on our ability to achieve both of those tests.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Great.   Thank you.  Jeanna . 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 29  
 JEANNA SMIALEK.   Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I wonder if 
you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated.  You ’ve 
obviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real 
data and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move .  But I guess I wonder 
what happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employmen t.  You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the 
fact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how , how  your reaction would 
be—sort of how your reaction to that is , is—how you’ re thinking about that.  
CHAIR POWELL.   Right.  So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation 
moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market.   I won ’t say that it ’s impossible, but it , it seems— it 
seems unlikely.  It ’s much more likely that we would —having achieved maximum -employment 
conditions —we ’d also be seeing 2  percent  inflation and be on track to see inflation moving 
above 2 percent .  They tend to move together.  So that ’s not to say inflation won’ t—might not 
move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that , that  really starts to move inflation 
expectations up, that would have to —that would take some time .  And you would think that , that  
it would be quite likely that , that  we’d be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening.  
If it—if that actually were to happen, though, there is a —there’s a  paragraph in the —in 
the Statement on L onger -Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy which says that when the two 
goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the , the time it would take to 
get back and [so] forth.  So we do —it doesn’ t really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we 
will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely  state.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 29  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Steve Lie sman.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle ’s 
question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID 
infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy.  As you recall, we had a major 
resurgence in the virus last fall .  And I’m wondering, would you need to be assured that there 
wasn ’t such a resurgence coming before you began—I mean, for lack of a better term —thinking 
about thinking about tapering?   And what kind of comfort level would you need?  Would it be 
something that would be declared from the CDC or the , or the  World Health Organization —for 
example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic —before you have the comfort level to reverse 
course on policy?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  W e, we really have —just articulated the goals that I’ve —that 
I’ve just mentioned a  couple of times , which is substantial further progress toward our goals 
before we taper.  Now, that ’s very likely—for us to achieve that, it ’s very likely going to be the 
case that we ’ve also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination 
and, and other —it, it—y ou know, those two things should more or less coexist.  
We haven ’t articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we ’d like to achieve 
because we’ re not —you know, we ’re not experts in that area.  We’ re, we’re  really focused on the 
economic outcomes, and, again, my , my guess is that we— it’s very likely, it seems to me, that 
for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates.  W e 
would also have to have made very substanti al progress in getting the virus under control —not , 
not necessarily fully under control.  There is a, a  possibility, of course, that we will , will have 
ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 29  
 as well.   But we ’ll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal —substantial further 
progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SM ITH.  Thank you.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Chair Powell.   I wanted to ask, you ’ve talked a lot during this 
crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there ’s not long- term scar ring in the economy .  And I was just wondering, you know, given 
all of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long- term 
scarring?  A nd, if so, you know, what are you most worried about?  Where are you most worried 
about that showing up?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say that we were very worried about scar ring, both in the 
labor market from people being out of —out of  the labor market for an extended period of time.  
The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you ’re out for a long time to get 
back in and get back to the life that you had.  Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations.  Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily?  
That was a big concern.  
I would say that , so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021.  We haven ’t 
experienced that level of scar ring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses.  So 
we’re not living that, that  downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago.  
Notwithstanding that, we ’re a long way from full employment.   We’ re—you know, payroll jobs 
are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020.  We’ve got a long ways to go.  A nd 
also, it ’s going to be a different economy. 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 29  
 So we ’ve been hearing a lot from companies that they are —they ’ve been looking at 
deploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service 
industries that have been employing a lot of people.  You know, it , it may well be —it seems 
quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service -sector jobs will struggle to 
find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had.  These were people who were working in February of 2020.  They clearly want to work.  So those people are going to need —they’ re going to need help.  
And so, while I would say we haven ’t seen really highly elevated levels of 
unemployment for —you know, up in the teens that we thought we  might have for an extended 
period of time, we ’ve still got a lot of people who are out to —out of work.  We want to get them 
back to work as quickly as possible, and that ’s really one of the things we ’re trying to achieve 
with our policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Sieg el. 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell , for taking our 
questions.  The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars, 
and all -cash offers well above asking price.  A nd this is happening at the same time that housing 
is becoming much more expensive for lower -income Americans and people who are still 
struggling from the pandemic.  Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles  
or that there ’s the potential f or that, and what is the Fed  doing to monitor or address this?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course .  And 
I would say that , before the pandemic, it ’s a very different housing market than it was before the 
Global F inancial C risis.  And one of the main differences was that households were in very good 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 29  
 shape financially compared to where they were.   In addition, most people who got mortgages 
were people with pretty high credit scores.  There wasn ’t the subprime —you know, low -doc, 
no-doc lending practices were not there.  So we don’ t have that kind of thing where we have a 
housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses.  
There ’s no q uestion, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we ’re watching that 
carefully.   It’s, it’s partly because there’ s, there’s  clearly strong demand, and there ’s just not a lot 
of supply right now.  So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up wi th the demand, clearly.  
Inventories are tremendously low.  We’re, we’re  all hearing those stories.  A nd if you’ re—if 
you’re an entry level housing buyer, this is —this is  a problem , because it just is going to be that 
much harder for people to get that first house , and that ’s a problem.  I mean, we —it’ s part of a 
strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing.  So, in 
that sense, it ’s good.  It ’s clearly the strongest housing market that we ’ve seen since the G lobal 
Financial C risis.  And, you know, my hope would be that , over time, housing builders can react 
to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry.  
So, you know, it is —it’s  not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and 
we’re watching it very carefully.  I don ’t see the kind of financial stability current concerns, 
though, that really do reside around the housing sector.  So ma ny of the financial crackups in all 
countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing.  We don’ t—we really don’ t see that here.  We don’ t see bad loans and unsustainable 
prices and that kind of thing. 
MICHEL LE SMITH.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 29  
 CHRIS RUGABER.  Thanks for taking my question.  I wanted to ask about the labor 
market.  Do you—do you see things,  such as in the Beige Book—you saw in the Beige Book 
anecdotes about businesses not able to find workers , [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear 
of getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth.  Do you see these as also just sort of temporary 
bottlenecks that won’ t have much effect on the long- term health of the la bor market?  Or how are 
you thinking about these kinds of issues?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Chris , you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your 
question.  So I think there are a number  of—a number  of things going on there :  the tension 
between a hi gh level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can’ t find —
an elevated number of companies saying that they can’ t find workers.  So, what ’s really going on 
there?  
It, it should be a number of different things.  There are workers who don’ t actually have 
the specific skills that the employers are looking for.  There may be geographical differences.   It, 
it may also be that, for example, there —one big factor would be , schools aren ’t open yet, so 
there  are still people who are at home taking c are of their children and would like to be back in 
the workforce but can ’t be yet.  There are people afraid of —there are virus fears that are 
weighing on people , so some —some people don’ t want to go back to work.  There are also a 
significant number of peo ple who say they’ ve retired —a large number of people that say that 
they’ re retired.  Now, it ’s hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market 
strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a—in the rearview mirror, in the history books, 
if you will.  
So—but clearly there ’s something going, going on out there, as , as many companies are 
reporting labor shortages.  We don’ t see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 29  
 that in a real —you know, in a really tight labor market.  And we may well start to see that.  I do 
think—so what will happen—what we saw during the last expansion, an d it may  be a different 
expansion, we don’ t know, but , but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up.  In 
other words, if you were worried about there —about running out of workers, it seemed like we 
never did.  You know, labor force participati on held up.  People came in the labor force.  They 
stayed in the labor force longer than expected.  
So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and 
these jobs will be —the labor market will reach equilibrium.  Maybe pay wi ll go up.  B ut I do 
think that —and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, 
so to the extent that ’s a factor, which is not clear , it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.  So my 
guess is, it will come back to this e conomy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor 
supply and labor demand.  It may take some months, though. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Heather Scott.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Could I do a q uick follow -up? 
MICHELLE SMITH.   I’m sorry.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Chris. 
CHRIS RUGABER.  Well [extended pause]  
MICHELLE SMITH.  We, we  lost you, Chris.  Let ’s go on to Heather.  
HEATHER SCOTT.  Thank you.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask you, 
you know , you’ ve been hearing, of course, these concerns r aised by Larry Summers and others 
about inflation and the fact that they think the Fed  might be —might let things get out of hand 
with the new policy stance.  So my question is , can you tell us , what is different this time versus 
previous periods like in the  ’60s when inflation got out of control ?  Why are you confident with, 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 29  
 with the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and  make sure it 
doesn’ t go too far above the 2 percent  target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks for your question.  S o I actually have a couple things I ’d like 
to say about inflation, including addressing your question.  So let me start with just saying that 
we’re very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price 
stability.  Our , our price stability goal is 2  percent  inflation over the longer run, and we believe 
that having inflation average 2 percent  over time will help anchor long- term inflation 
expectations at 2 percent .  With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent  for some time , 
the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times —above 2 percent  for 
some time.  
So, with a , a little bit of context, we ’re, we’re  making our way through an unprecedented 
series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to 
widespread reopening of economies  in many places around the world.  In the United States, 
fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support :  Vaccinations are now 
widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum.  During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I ’ll discuss why.  
But those pres sures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process.  
In an episode of one -time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing 
as, and is not likely to lead to , persistently higher year -over-year inflation into the future —
inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2  percent  inflation over time.  Indeed, it 
is the Fed ’s job to make sure that that does not happen.  If, if , contrary to expectations, inflation 
were to move persistently and materially  above 2  percent  in a manner that threatened to move 
longer -term inflation expectations materially above 2  percent , we would use our tools to bring 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 29  
 inflation and expectations down to mandate -consistent levels.  And I would say, if I may, that is 
a principal difference from—we ’re all very familiar at the Fed  with the history of the 1960s and 
’70s, of course.  And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent  inflation over time.   We’ re 
committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that.  So that ’s a very different situation than 
you had back in the 1960s —or many, many differences , actually.  
So let me talk quickly about the two reasons —two , or you could say three, but really two 
main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term.  Th e first is the base effect s.  
Twelve -month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent  over the next few 
months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of 
the calculation.  That process has alr eady started to show up.  You saw it in the March CPI 
reading, and you’ ll see it later this week in the PCE price data.  These base effects will contribute 
about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in 
April and May.  So, significant increases, and they ’ll disappear over the following months.  And 
they’ ll be transitory.  They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods.   So that ’s 
base effects.  
The other big one I would talk about is bottleneck s.  So this is what we ’re seeing in 
supply chains in various industries, and we ’re, we’re  in close touch with all of these industries.  
You know, the Fed  has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits 
for that matter,  too.  So what do we mean by a bottleneck?  A bottleneck really is a temporary 
blockage or restriction in the supply chain for , for a particular good or goods, something that 
slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market.  We think of 
bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt , and 
we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they’ re temporary and 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 29  
 expected to resolve themselves.  We know that the base e ffects will disappear in a few months.  
It’s much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the 
bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the 
meantime.  
So, you know, I ’ll just sum up and say, we understand our job.  We will do our job.  A nd 
we are, we are focused —as you’ ve seen, for many years, we ’ve been focused on inflation 
deviating below 2 percent , and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent .  If, 
if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent  in a persistent way that risks inflation 
expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent .  No one should doubt that we will do that.  This is  not what we expect .  But no one 
should doubt that , in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James Politi.  
JAMES POLITI.  Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that  it would —thank you, 
Chair Powell.  You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal.  Can you define what your , what your  
definition of “ a string of months ” is more specifically?  And , on inflation, the FOMC said the 
rise in inflation we ’re beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described .  
But why use the word “ largely, ” and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be 
transitory , based on  the initial data that you ’re seeing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, what is “ a string ”?  What do I mean by “ a string ”?  Well, I would 
say, what we have right now is one really good —I can tell you what it ’s not.  It ’s not one really 
good employment reading, which is w hat we got in March.  We got close to a million jobs in 
March and a very strong labor market reading.  And I was just suggesting that we ’d want to see 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 29  
 more like that.  We’re 8½  million jobs below where we were in February  of 2020, and that 
doesn’ t account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on.  
So we have —we ’re a long way from our , our goals .  And we don’ t have to get all the way to our 
goals to taper asset purchases, w e just need to make substantial further progress.  It ’s going to 
take some time.  
On, on “ largely, ” there are a bunch of factors.   I was really thinking —we were thinking 
of the base effects and also the energy effects.  I wasn ’t meaning to say there are some real 
effects.   I mean, there are alway s—there are always relative prices going up and down within 
inflation.  You know, there ’s a basket for CPI or PCE.   There  are, you know, many, many, many 
factors that go into it.  Relative prices are always moving up and down.  This , this —we think it ’s, 
it’s very fair to say that the increases we see and , frankly , are about to see later this week are 
largely due to base effects.  It would have been more contentious to say “ entirely due to base 
effects ” because there are some things that are always going up , and so we just said “ largely. ” 
MICHELLE SMITH.  [Inaudible]  
CATARINA SARAIVA.   Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Over the 
past decade, the Fed  has invested significant resources in large- scale bank supervision —has 
completely overhauled that approach.  And it ’s even created a special committee that looks 
horizontally across the largest banks to find common risks.  Did the Fed  not see that multiple 
banks ha d large exposures to Archegos?  If not, why not?   And then, what regulatory changes 
would you like to see implemented to change that going forward?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’re, we, we  supervise banks to make sure that they have risk -
management systems in place so that they can spot these things.  We don’ t manage their 
companies for them or , or try to manage individual risks.   In the gra nd scheme of these large 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 29  
 institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they 
would have really created trouble for any of those institutions. 
What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of 
firms that is thought to be —to carry relatively well understood risks.  The prime brokerage 
business is, is  a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a num ber of them would 
have had this .  And it was essentially , I believe , the fact that, that  they had the same big risk 
position on  with a number of firms, and they weren’ t—some of the firms were not aware that 
there were other firms that had those things.  I , I wouldn’ t say it’ s in any way an indictment of 
our supervision of  these firms.   It, it—i n some cases, it may be they were —it seems as though 
there were risk -management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them.  And that ’s what 
we’re looking into.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I —I’m wondering, are you 
planning to visit the homeless encampm ent that’s near the Fed in Washington that you drive by?  
Have you been invited, and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there?  
CHAIR POWELL.   You know, frankly, yes.  I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I ’ve 
been very busy, but I will visit.  I don ’t want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention , 
because I don ’t want that to be part of the story.  But I will— I will go visit when, when it’ s no 
longer a , a news story .  And I—you know, I —I’ve met with homeless people many times, a 
number of times, anyway, let ’s say.  And I , I think it’ s always good to talk to people and hear 
what ’s going on in their lives.  What you find out is , they ’re you.  They ’re just us.   I mean, 
they’ re, they’re —these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives, 
and they’ ve just , they’ve just  found themselves in this place.  It’s, it’s a—it’s a difficult problem, 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 29  
 though.  You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I ’m well aware th at this is not 
something that the F ed has all the tools for or anything like that.  But I , I will do that when , when 
the need arises and when , when it’ s not so much, you know, in the public eye. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   And is there anything specifically th at you would be 
looking to learn there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Not really.  I mean, I , I think I know what I ’ll find there.   I, I think 
you, you connect with these people and what you—again, what you find is , they ’re like you.  
That could be  you.  I mean, that could be your sister.  That could be, you know, your kid.  You , 
you always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and , you know, it just is  a—it’s a —it’ s an 
important thing to engage in, I think.  A nd I think, you know, we bring that understanding into 
our lives and , frankly , into our work—the work that we do as well.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Hannah Lang. 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  I wanted to ask about digital currency.  You previously said a 
few times that you think it’ s important for th e U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right 
rather than be first.  But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of , of moving too slow on, on digital currency. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I t hink the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to 
understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well.  Central bank digital 
currencies are now possible, and we’ re going to see some of them around the world.  And we 
need to understand whether that ’s something that would be a good thing for the people that we 
serve.  How would it work in our system?  And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we —and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the 
technology and the policy issues.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 29  
 I am—I would say this :  We’re the world ’s reserve currency, and that means that the 
dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency.  And that ’s 
because of our rule of law ; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world ; our 
economy;  our industrious people ; all the things that make the United States the United States.  
That’s why we ’re the , the reserve currency.  And , of course, we have open capital accounts, 
which is essential if you ’re going to be the reserve currency.  So those are the factors that make 
us the reserve currency.  
I am—I’m  less concerned that someone—that another country might have a digital 
currency f irst.  You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that , if you were a company 
that’s doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use 
your—do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dol lars, where , where —
which is what everyone does?  And I ’m not so concerned about , about  that.  I am really 
concerned about getting it right.  
It is—it is a —it is  a tricky set of questions that we  have to navigate in a world where we 
already have, remember, a  highly evolved payment system.  We have F edNow and other 
immediately available funds.  Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in 
other parts of the world , which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments 
all the time.  It’ll be normal.  A nd what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in 
that kind of an environment?   Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that 
we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead.  
I mean, that—what  the China —the currency that ’s being used in China is not one that 
would—that would work here.  It ’s, it’s one that really allows the government to see every 
payment that ’s used —for which it is used in real time.   It’s much more to do with things that are 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 29  
 happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with  the global —you 
know, sor t of global competition.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Michael Derby.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  I wanted to ask you another 
question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations.  A n umber of different 
surveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation 
expectations ratings.  So I wonder ed, you know, if , if that was something that you saw consistent 
with your inflation outlook.  Is that something that worries you, or do you see that  as, maybe, 
you know, the success of the F ed’s new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the , to 
the broader public?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit —and here we 
think of survey, market  based —survey being eith er households or , or economists and , and  
market based.  You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what 
would have been consistent with a 2 percent  inflation target, particularly our 2  percent  inflation 
target, which calls f or 2 percent  average inflation.  So they’ re at the low end.  Inflation 
expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they’ ve just 
moved back up to levels broadly— that, that  are where they were in 2018 , or in some cases 2014 , 
and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate.  
And we want them to be —we want them to be higher and—you know, on a persistent 
basis.  We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been ru nning for the last quarter of a 
century.  We want it to average 2  percent , not 1.7 percent .  And for that, we need to see inflation 
expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2  percent .  We don’ t really see 
that yet, but I would sa y that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up,  in a way.  Breakevens 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 29  
 are based on CPI, of course, but they’re, they’re  now at levels that are— that are  pretty close to 
mandate consistent , whereas before, they were below.  We monitor inflation expectation s very, 
very carefully, as you would obviously know.  So  that’s where —that ’s where I would say it is.  
MICHAEL DERBY.   Just o ne small follow -up.  Do you have any redlines on inflation 
readings  where if, you know, you hit , like, a  certain number on, say, you know, core PC E, that 
would be, you know, a trigger response from the F ed? 
CHAIR POWELL.  It doesn ’t work that way.  You know, we ’re, we’re —inflation 
measures are always going to be a bit volatile.  We expect —as I mentioned, we expect core and , 
and head line PCE to move up because of base effects, and —you know, I —and we expect that to 
go away.  We, we  also expect these, these  bottleneck effects to come in.  We don’ t know how 
persistent they ’ll be.  We , we think they’ ll—you know, it ’s a matter of , of when they will pass 
through, not whether they will pass through.  But we can ’t be confident about the exact timing of 
that or the size of them.  They don’ t seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we , we 
don’t know. 
I mean, you know, this is —this is  all about the reopening of the economy.   That ’s what ’s 
happening.  We had it —we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help 
from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy , and, you know, a great deal of 
help from vaccination, we ’re seeing a strong rebound in activity.  And what ’s happening is , it’s, 
it’s—demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and —the saved -up fiscal transfers and , and 
people going back to work and thin gs like that.  The supply side will take a little bit of time to 
adapt.  New restaurants will have to be opened.  The supply of various inputs into the goods part 
of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed.  And you—you’ re seeing some of that.   
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 29  
 That’ll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters.  You’ll see some of the bottlenecks 
resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Brian Ch eung. 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Brian Ch eung with —hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Ch eung with 
Yahoo Finance.  I wanted to ask about financial stability , which is a part of the F ed’s reaction 
function here.  It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they’ re 
paying attent ion to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin.  And it seems like there ’s interesting 
reach for yield in this market— to some extent , also Archegos.  So does the F ed see a relationship 
between low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from the F ed’s perspective at this time?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So we look at —financial stability for us is really —we have a 
broad framework, s o we don’ t just jump from one thing to another.  I know many people just 
look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the —in the  equity 
markets, which , which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets.  But really , it—really, we try 
to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can —so we can  talk about it the same way 
each time and so we can be held accountable for it.  
So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high.  You 
are seeing , seeing things in the capital markets that, that  are—that are  a bit frothy.  That ’s a fact.   
I won ’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also—it has a tremendous amount to 
do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.  That ’s really what has been moving markets 
a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a f ast—a 
much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening.  So that’s, that’s part of what’ s going on. 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 29  
 The othe r—the other  things, though —you know, leverage in the financial system , is it —
is, is not a problem.  That ’s a— that’s a —that was one of the four pillars.  Asset prices was one.  
Leverage in the financial system is, is  not an issue ; we have very well capitalized large banks.  
We have funding risks for , for our largest financial institutions  that are  also very low.  We do 
have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they’ re not systemic 
right now.  
And, and th e household sector is actually in pretty good shape.  It was in —it was in a  
very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis—sorry, the pandemic crisis hit.  
There  were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all 
of that , that the —that the  household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically.  That 
hasn’t happened.  So, with the fiscal transfers, money that ’s on household balance sheets, they ’re 
in good shape.  You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing.  
So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it ’s—you know, it ’s 
manageable,  I would say .  And it’s—by the way, I think it ’s appropriate and important for 
financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity.  Again, 8½ million 
people who had jobs in February don’ t have them now, and, you know, there ’s a long way to go 
until we reach our goal.  So that ’s what I would say. 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  As a follow -up, you mentioned money market pressures .  The Fed 
didn’ t make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves.  What was the logic behind that? 
It seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero.  So just hoping for clarification on that.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So the federal funds rate has been well within target and —at 
target range, and money market funds —money market conditions are , are fine.  We have the 
ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case.  We do expect 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 29  
 further downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the —in the  
Treasury G eneral A ccount.  But , at this point, we didn’ t see a need for —to, to deploy our tools 
to, to support rate s.  And , of course, we will do so if , if the need does arise.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jean Yung. 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Chair Powell.   I wanted to ask a , a similar question.  We are seeing 
elevated market valuations , and some economists are concerned that the economy might 
overheat, at least for a period of time.  So should the F ed and other regulators be thinking about 
tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial stability risk s stay as low as they have been?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me —went up 
tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic.  And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed 
three , three  of our —two of our stress tests, and that is another one that ’s pending.  So capital is, 
is in a good place , as far as I ’m concerned, in the banking system.  
But, to your point , what we saw was—so what , what  kind of happened during the 
pandemic crisis that , that  requires attention, and number one is money market funds and 
corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to —we ’re, we’re  looking 
at that.  So we ’re looking at ways , and people around the world are looking at ways , to make 
those vehicles resilient so that they don ’t have to be, you know, supported by the government 
whenever there’ s, you know, severely stressed market conditions.  It’ s a private business.  They , 
they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the F ed and others 
to—around the world to come in.  So that was that.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 25 of 29  
 The other one is T reasur y market structure.   Dealers are committing less capital to that 
activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there ’s 
so much more supply of Treasuries.  And so there are some questions about T reasur y market 
structure, and there ’s a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there ’s something we 
can do about this , because we—you know, the U.S. T reasury market is probably the most single 
important —single most important market in , in the economy and  the world.   It needs to be  
liquid.  It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens.  
So it’s not clear what , what —where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful 
look—and the T reasury Department is , is really going to be leading this —at, at Treasury market 
structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong 
Treasury market that can work even in difficult times.  As , as you know, at the very beginning of 
the financial —of the —of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling T reasuries, 
including by foreign central banks, that , really , the dealers couldn ’t handle the volume.  And so 
what was happening was , the ma rket was really starting to lose function, and that’s —that was a 
really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases.  And, you 
know, so we ’d like to , we’d like to see if there isn ’t something we can do to—is —do we need to 
build against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like?  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, F ed Chairman , for the question.  So I’m interested 
in your thoughts.  There ’s so much fiscal he lp and accommodation from the Federal Reserve.  
You said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or , or lead to more 
normal economic conditions later this year.  When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak ?  And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the 
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 26 of 29  
 accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be 
injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation —nature of the inflation?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.   When will the economy be , be able to stand on its own feet?   I’m not 
sure if —I’m not sure what the exact nature of that question is.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  What , what  I’m saying is, is, you know, when will the —when 
will you need to lower the , the amount of T reasuries you ’re buying to  sort of taper off a little bit?  
When can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side?  And then—and then, further,  the transitory.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  Sorry.  So we have —you know, we ’ve articulated our test for 
that, as you know, and that is just , we’ll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see 
substantial further progress.  And we ’re, we’re  going to communicate well in advance of any 
decision.  W e’re going to let, you know, the , the public know that that ’s what we’ re thinking.  
And, and so there ’ll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing.  But it’ s about substantial further 
progress toward our goals.  That ’s, that’s  really all it is.  It doesn ’t have any , any external, virus -
related specific requirement , although, again, I do think it ’ll—you know, the , the virus will need 
to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals.  But it’ s really the 
economic  goals.  
Now, your second question.  Sorry , just say again.  I didn’ t quite get th at question.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Yes, sure.  With all the fiscal spending that’ s happened and 
the accommodation and —does , does  the system need more spending either from the fiscal side 
or accommodation , or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put 
those upward, upward pressures on inflation long term?  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 27 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s really up to Congress.   We—we ’re not an advis er to 
Congress.  You know, we don’ t, we don’t  weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals.  That ’s 
really between elected parties.  You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who 
stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions , and 
they get to be accountable to the voters.  We didn ’t do any of that, and we don’ t have a seat at 
that table.  We don’ t seek a seat at that table.  So that ’s really something for Congress and the 
Administration to , to deal with.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Greg  Robb. 
GREG ROBB.  Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Thank you—thank you so much for 
the—for the  opportunity.   I wanted to circle back to the housing market.  I t’s just kind of 
confusing that the question and your answer —you know, the housing market is strong, prices are 
up.  And yet the F ed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage -related assets.  Why is that, 
and are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  I, I mean, we ’re—we  started buying MBS becaus e the 
mortgage -backed security market was, was  really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we ’ve 
sort of , sort of  articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that.  It ’s not meant to provide 
direct assistance to , to the housing market.  That was never the intent.  It was really just to keep 
that as —it’s a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own.  
And so that ’s, that’s  why we , we bought as we did during the Global F inancial C risis; we bought 
MBS too.  Again, not , not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was , which was  
really not , not a problem this time at all.  So —and, you know, it ’s, it’s a situation where we will, 
we will  taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those , those  purchases will 
come to zero over time.   And that time is not yet.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 28 of 29  
 GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  A nd for the last question, we ’ll go to Mike McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since I a m last, let me go back to 
Paul’s question, the first question, and ask him —ask you whether —not whether you ’re thinking 
about thinking of  tapering , but why you’ re not.  We’re seeing bank lending fall.  The markets 
seem to be operating well.  Are you afraid of a taper tantrum?  O r is it, as one money manager 
put it, “If you get out of the markets, there aren ’t enough buyers for all of the T reasury debt , and 
so rates would have to go way up”?  The b ottom -line question is , what do we get for $ 120 billion 
a month that we couldn’ t get for less?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So it ’s really not more complicated than this.  We, we  articulated the 
“substantial further progress ” test at our December meeting .  And, really , for the  next couple of 
months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals.  And, remember, substantial further 
progress from December —from our December meeting.   And then vaccination started to get 
more widespread.  The economy reopened.  We got a really nice job report for March.  It doesn ’t 
constitute substantial further progress.  It’s not close to substantial further progress.  
We’re hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal .  And we believe we 
will; it just is a question of when.  And so, when that time —when the time comes for us to talk 
about talking about it, we ’ll do that.  And—but that time is not now.  It’ s—we ’re just not —we ’re 
not that f ar.  We’ ve had one great jobs report.  It ’s not enough.  You know, we ’re going to act on 
actual data, not on our  forecast .  And we ’re just going to need to see more data.  That’s —it’s no, 
no more complicated than that.  
April 28, 2021 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 29 of 29  
 MICHAEL MCKEE.   Well, i f you leave rates where they are, it doesn’ t change anything.  
But does it change anything if you actually tapered a bit ?  If you spent less , would you still get 
the same effect on the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.   If we bought less?  You ’re, you’re  very faint.   So if someone has the 
volume, they can turn it up.  But if we bought less, you know, no.  I mean, I think the effect is 
proportional to the amount we buy.  It ’s, it’s really part of overall accommodative financial 
conditions.  We, we  have tri ed to create accommodative financial conditions to support 
economic activity, and we did that.  
And we articulated the —you know, the , the tests for withdrawing that accommodation.  
And we think, you know —so we ’re waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled b oth for asset 
purchases and for liftoff of rates.  And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we ’ll, we’ll go 
ahead .  As we—you know, we ’ve done this before.  We did it in , in the last —after the last crisis, 
and, you know, we ’ll do it in , in maybe —we ’ll do i t—as those tests are satisfied , we’ll do it.  
And the —and the  only thing that will guide us is , are the tests met?   You know, that, that ’s what 
we focused on:  I s—have , have  the macroeconomic conditions that we’ ve articulated, have they 
been realized?  That will be the test for , for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you very much.  Take care.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
June 16 , 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero  and maintained 
our asset purchases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to deliver powerful support to the 
economy until the recovery is complete.  
Widespread vaccinations, along wit h unprecedented fiscal policy actions, are also 
providing strong support to the recovery.  Indicators of economic activity and employment have 
continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of 
increase in de cades.  Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity 
from depressed levels.  The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but 
have shown improvement.  Household spending is rising at a rapid pace, boosted by th e ongoing 
reopening of the economy, fiscal support, and accommodative financial conditions .  The  housing 
sector is strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace.  In some industries, near-term supply constraints are restraining activity.  F orecasts from FOMC participants for economic 
growth this year have been revised up since our March Summary of Economic Projections.  Even so, the recovery is incomplete , and risks to the economic outlook remain.  
As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to 
improve, although the pace of improvement has been uneven.  Employment rose 419,000 per month, on average , in April and May, with the leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post 
notable gains.  Employment in th is sector and the economy as a whole remains well below pre -
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 30 
 pandemic levels.  The unemployment rate remained elevated in May at 5.8 percent, and this 
figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.  Factors 
related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment 
insurance payments , appear to be weighing on employment growth.  These factors should wane 
in coming months against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate st anding at 4.5 percent at the end 
of this year and declining to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.  
The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to 
shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progres s, joblessness continues 
to fall disproportionately on lower-wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans 
and Hispanics.  
Inflation ha s increased notably in recent months .  The 12 -month change in PCE prices 
was 3.6 percent in April and will l ikely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.  
Part of the increase reflects  the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall ing out of the 
calculation a s well as the pass -through of past increases in oil prices to, to consumer energy 
prices.  Beyond these effects, we are also seeing upward pressure on prices from the rebound in 
spending as the economy continues to reopen, particularly as supply bottlenecks have  limit ed 
how quickly production in some sectors can respond in the near term.  These bottleneck effects 
have been larger than anticipated, and FOMC participants have revised up their projections for, 
for inflation notably for this year.  As these  transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 30 
 to drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from  
3.4 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023.  
The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the 
onset of the pandemic.  As the reopening continues, shifts in demand can be large and rapid, and 
bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply 
can adjust, raising the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more  persistent 
than we expect.  Our new framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having 
well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to 
promote our broad-based and inclusive maximum -employme nt goal.  Indicators of longer-term 
inflation expectations have generally reversed the declines seen earlier in the pandemic and have 
moved into a range that appears broadly consistent with our longer-run inflation goal of 
2 percent.  If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer -term inflation expectations were 
moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, we ’d be prepared to 
adjust the stance of monetary policy.  
The pandemic continues to pose risks to the economic outlook.  Progress on vaccinations 
has limited the spread of COVID -19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public 
health crisis on the economy.  However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed, and new strains of the virus remain a risk.  Continue d progress on vaccinations will support a return to more normal 
economic conditions . 
The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promot e the stability of the financial system.  As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy 
statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2 percent, we will aim to achieve inflation 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 30 
 moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and 
longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are 
achieved.  With regard to interest rates, we c ontinue to expect that it will be appropriate to 
maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market 
conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum 
employment and inflation ha s risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent 
for some time.  
As is evident in the SEP, many participants forecast that these favorable economic 
conditions will be met somewhat sooner than previously projected; the median projection for the 
appropriate level of the federal funds rate now lies above the effective lower bound in 2023.  Of 
course, these projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with 
any certainty where the economy will be a couple of years  from now.  More important than any 
forecast is the fact that, whenever liftoff comes, policy will remain highly a ccommodative .  
Reaching the conditions for liftoff will mainly signal that the recovery is strong and no longer 
requires holding rates near zero.  
In addition, we are continuing to increase —continuing to increase  our holdings of 
Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage -backed securities 
by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our 
maximum-employment and price -stability goals.  The increase in our balance sheet since March 
2020 has materia lly eased financial conditions and is providing substantial support to the 
economy.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 30 
 At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee had a discussion on the 
progress made toward our goals since the Committee adopted it s asset purchase guidance la st 
December.  While reaching the standard of “substantial further progress” is still a ways off, 
participants expect that progress will continue.  In coming meetings, the Committee will 
continue to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals.  As we hav e said, w e will provide 
advance notice before  announcing any decision to make changes to our purchases.  
On a final note, we made a technical adjustment today to the Federal Reserve’s 
administered rates.  The IOER and overnight RRP rates were adjusted upward by 5 basis points  
in order to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range and to support smooth functioning in money markets.  This technical adjustment has no bearing on the appropriate path 
for the federal funds rate or stance of monetary policy . 
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel S iegel, the Washington Post.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our 
questions.  I’m wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have , specifically when it 
comes to the labor market going into 2023.  And I’m curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare.  Perhaps 
they’ve retired ea rly.  Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you 
consider full employment going into 2023?  Thank you.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 30 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you 
look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it ’s clear , 
and I am confident , that we are on a path to a very strong labor market —a labor market that , that  
shows low unemploym ent, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum.  I 
mean, I think that ’s, that’s  shown in our projections, it ’s shown in outside projections.  And if 
you look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we ’re going to be 
looking at a very, very strong labor market.  
In terms of exactly what that means, we ’ll, we’ll  have to see how things evolve.  I think 
we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor 
supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend.  
And, and I have no reason to think that that won’t happen again.  At the same time, we have 
seen—in terms of participation, we ’ve seen a significant number of, of people retire.  And so we , 
we don’t actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I 
would tend to, to look at it and think that it —that it can return to high levels, although it may 
take some time to do that.  But overall, this is —this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor 
market.  
In terms of the near term, you ask as well —so we see a couple of things, a few things that 
seem likely to be holding back labor supply.  There are very large amounts of job openings , and 
there are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed.  And the pace of, of filling 
those jobs is —somehow feels slower than it might be.  So I ’d point to a number of things , the 
first of which is just that most of the , the act of sort of goi ng back to one ’s old job—that ’s kind 
of already happened.  So this is a question of people finding a new job.  And that ’s just a process 
that takes longer.  There may be something of a speed limit on it.  You ’ve got to find a job 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 30 
 where , where  your skills m atch what , you know, what , what  the employer wants.  It ’s got to be 
in the right area.  There ’s just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job.  So that ’s, that’s  
sort of a natural thing.  
In addition, I would say that we , we look at, for example, a , a significant number of 
people still say that they ’re concerned about going back to work in jobs where there ’s a lot of 
public facing because of—because of COVID.  So that ’s clearly holding back some people, and 
that should diminish as vaccinations move  ahead.  
There ’s also the question of childcare.  Many are engaged in, in caretaking.  And as 
schools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall —in the fall,  then we 
should see —we should see  that supporting labor force participation by caretakers.  
Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or 
be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of 
September , and I’d lik e some —that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs.  So 
you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well.  So you put all those 
together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summe r and 
going into—going into the fall.  
I will also say , though, the last thing I’ ll say is , this is an extraordinarily unusual time.  
And we , we really don’t have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like 
this.  And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data.  It ’s not a 
time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of 
policy.  We need to see more data.  We need to be a little bit patient.  And I do think, though, that 
we’ll, we’ll, we’ll  be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will —that will 
inform our, our thinking.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 30 
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Paul Kiernan.  
PAUL KIERNAN.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for the question.  Your—the 
Committee’s median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the 
rest of the year.  As you know, the three -month annualized rate for the past three months was , I 
think, 8.4 percent  in the CPI.  And I’m just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain 
those , those  kinds of rates before you get nervous.  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few 
months.  But if you look behind the headline numbers, you’ll see that the incoming data are , are 
consistent with the view that prices —that prices  that are driving that higher inflation are from 
categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening 
of the economy.  
So, for example, the experience with, with  lumber prices is , is illustrative of this.  The 
thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and 
bottlenecks and the like, t hey should stop going up, and at some point , they, they, in some cases , 
should actually go down.  And we did see that in the case of lumber.  
Another example where we haven ’t seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted 
for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation.  Used car prices are going up because 
of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply.  It ’s going up at just an 
amazing annual rate.  But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time.  So we think we ’ll be seeing some of that.  
When wi ll we be seeing it?  We’re not sure.  That narrative seems, still seems quite likely 
to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the , the timing 
of that is , is pretty uncertain, and so are the , the effects in the ne ar term.  But over time, it seems 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 30 
 likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be —will be temporary.  
And we ’ll be, you know, we’re going to be  looking.  We’ll be looking at the monthly pricing 
data.  I’ll , I’ll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum -
employment goal, but also for inflation.  And we ’ll be looking at that.  And , and as I —as I 
mentioned, we expect and I expe ct that we’ll see increases in supply over coming months as the 
factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down.  So I , I can ’t give 
you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down.  
If you look at the —if you look at the  forecast for 2021 and—sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my 
colleagues on the , on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect 
inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal.  And I think the fu ll range of, of, of 
inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent , which is consistent with our—with 
our goals. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC.  
YLAN MUI.  Hi.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this.  My que stion for you is that 
you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you’re making 
toward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases.  In that discussion, 
you said that you didn’t —haven ’t made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue 
to make progress.  In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to 
see that progress be made and when you migh t consider starting to reduce those purchases?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I , I expect that we ’ll be able to say more about timing as 
we see more data.  Basically, there ’s not a lot of more light I can—I can  shed on that.  But you 
can think of this meeting t hat we had as the “talking about talking about ” meeting, if you like.  
And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has —which has  served its purpose well, I 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 30 
 think.  So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in 
Dece mber, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of 
substantial further progress.  Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective.  
And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing 
our asset purchases at a future meeting.  So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to 
assess the economy ’s progress toward our goals, and we ’ll give advance notice before 
announcing any decision.  The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress 
and not on any calendar.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Chris Rugaber, AP. 
CHRIS RUGABER.  Right.  Thank you.  Well, you mentioned—let me ask about 
inflation expectations.  You said they we re—I think you mentioned in your opening statement 
that you saw them as within target.  Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures 
we’ve seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve ’s three -year outlook, which jumped 
a bit—should those sort of be dismissed?  And are we only looking at longer-term inflation 
expectations?  And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point?  And on a 
related note, would the F ed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a 
monthly basis?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we , we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, 
because that ’s really, we think, what matters for, for inflation.  So and, and, you know, the 
shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.  So you’ll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you’ll see the shorter -term inflation expectation measures, 
particularly the surveys, move up.  And , and that’s, that’s  maybe not a good signal for future 
inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 30 
 So we—ye s, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer- term inflation 
expectations, they’ve moved up.  They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you 
know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the 
ECB and the Bank of Japan have been , where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding 
down and you have a really hard tim e stopping that process once it begins.  So that was a 
concern.  So it ’s, it’s good, actually , to see inflation —longer- term inflation expectations move 
back up to a range —it’s a range that ’s consistent with what our objectives are.  
These are not precise me asures , and that’s —and they , they contain risk premiums of 
various kinds.  And that ’s why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the 
movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of 
economists, surveys of the public , and also market  based.  It ’s, it’s, it’s a wide index, as I’m sure 
you know.  We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were.  And , by the 
way, they’ve  been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many 
years ago, at a time when inflation was , was, was still anchored at around 2 percent  or maybe 
even a little bit below.  So the answer is , yes, I think they are anchored and the y’re at a good 
place right now.  It ’s gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows.  And, 
you know, as you know, it ’s, it’s fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to 
assure that inflation—longer- term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent 
with our goal.  We , we think that ’s an important reason.  If, if inflation expectations are not 
anchored at a place that ’s consistent with your goal, it ’s not clear why you would expect to hit 
your goal over the  longer term.  So it’s important.  
MICHELLE SMTH.  Okay, now we ’ll go to James Politi with the FT.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 30 
 JAMES POLITI.  Chair Powell —thanks, Chair Powell.  Your economic projections 
today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent , and core inflation of 
3 percent .  If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute 
substantial further progress , in your mind?  And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort 
of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the 
time, I mean, is this kind of—can you describe the sort of tone of the —of the  discussion in the 
Committee?  And are we really moving towards sort of a post -pandemic stance?  Is there greater 
confidenc e that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than 
expected?  
CHAIR POWELL.  On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at 
substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make.  And it would not be 
appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not —that do or do not  qualify.  
That is —that is , you know, the process that we ’re beginning now at the next meeting.  We will 
begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about  what we —what we  think 
we’re seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around 
the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases.  
In terms of the , the, the two hikes —so let me say a couple things  first of all, not for the 
first time, about the —about the  dot plot.  These are, of course, individual projections.  They’re 
not a Committee forecast, they’re not a plan.  And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be —
would be  highly premature, wouldn’t make any sense.  If you look at the transcripts from five 
years ago, you’ll see that sometimes people mention their rate path  in their interventions.  Often 
they don’t.  And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 30 
 moves.  And that ’s not because —it’s just because it ’s so highly uncertain.  There is no great 
forecaster of, of future dots.  So , so dots to be taken with a —with a big , big grain of salt.  
However, so let me talk about this , this, this  meeting.  The Committee spelled out, as you 
know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the 
target range is made.  And it ’s outcome  based , it’s not time based.  And , as I mentioned, it ’s 
labor market conditions consistent wi th maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent  and on 
track to exceed 2 percent .  In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the 
economy evolving in their most likely case.  And , honestly, the main message I would take away 
from the SEP is that participants —many, many participants are more comfortable that the 
economic conditions in the Committee’s forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than 
previously anticipated.  And that would be a welcome development.  If such outcomes 
materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals.  
So th e other thing I’ll say is , rate increases are really not at all the focus of the 
Committee.  The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy.  But in terms of our 
tools, it ’s about asset purchases.  That ’s what we ’re thinking about.  Liftoff is, is well into the 
future.  The conditions for liftoff—we ’re very far from maximum employment, for example.  
It’s, it’s a consideration for the future.  So the near-term thing is really —the real near -term 
discussion , discussion that will begin is really  about the , the path of asset purchases.  And , as I 
mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings , continue to 
think about our progress. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  W e’ll go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer  from 
Marketplace.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 30 
 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Continuing—Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, 
when you’re ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to 
do that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  our intention for this process is that it  will be orderly, methodical, 
and transparent.  And I can just tell you, we , we, we see real value in communicating well in 
advance what our thinking is.  And we ’ll try to be clear.  And , as I mentioned, we ’ll, we’ll  give 
advance notice before announcing a decision to taper.  And so all I can say is that we , we think 
it’s important —we think where the balance sheet ’s concerned, a lot of notice, as much 
transparency as we can give , and as far —as far  in advance as we can to give people a chance to 
adjust their  expectations.  And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach 
substantial further progress and then have a —have a  decision.  Again, I have nothing further on 
time.  It wouldn’t be appropriate to say.  We’re going to have to see more data.  We’re a ways 
away from substantial further progress, we think.  But we ’re making progress.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  So  you can’t say generally how far in advance you 
would signal?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Again, as we —as we approach that goal, we ’ll provide, you know, as 
much clarity as we can.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres at Bloomberg.  If I were a businessman looking at the 
forecast today, I would ask how and when the F ed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent  
inflation.  In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period?  Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because , over the next three years , you’re going to be above inflation?  So 
what is your look-back period?  Does t he Committee have one?  And if not, why not?  And if 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 30 
 they don’t, why isn’t this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 
2¼ percent ?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so as part of our year-and-a -half-long process, the review  
that we did and came out with at the end of that with the —with the  new S tatement on L onger-
Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, we looked  carefully at the idea.  We ’ve all read all the 
literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that.  And we concluded—and, you know, I strongly agree —that it’s not wise to , to wed yourself to a particular formulation of 
that.  So we did adopt a discretionary—there ’s an element of discretion in it.  You know, it says 
that we will seek  to—seek  inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent  for some time.  And 
it’s, it’s meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent  over time.  And 
that under the old—under the  old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was , 
2 percent  was a  ceiling because all of the errors were below.  You were always getting back to 
2 percent .  So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be 
centered around 2.  So , so that’s, that’s  the approach that we ’re taking.  And you’re right, it ’s 
not—it’s not  a formulaic approach.  We were clear on that when we announced the framework.  
Was there another part of your question, Craig?  
CRAIG TORRES.  T hat pretty much answers it, Chair Powell.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Michael Derby.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thanks for taking my question.  So I wanted to ask you about the 
reverse repo usage that we ’ve seen lately.  I was curious if you are at all concerned about the 
level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility.  And do you believe that the changes in the Fed’s rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that?  And then, in a related question, do 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 30 
 you think that F ed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now 
and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So on the —on the  facility, we think it’s doing its job.  We think it’s 
doing—the reverse repo facility is , is doing what it ’s supposed to do, which is to provide a floor 
under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its—well within  its range.  
So we ’re not concerned with it.  It’s doing—you have an unusual situation where the T reasury 
General A ccount is , is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking.  And so there ’s, there’s  downward 
pressure —we ’re buying assets —there’s downward pressure on short -term rates, and that facility 
is, is doing what we think it ’s supposed to do.  Sorry, your second question was again?  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have 
any impact on—do you think that will reduce the , the amount of money coming into  reverse 
repos?  Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed 
funds rate setting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It could have some impact.  I think we ’ll have to see empirically.   
But it ’s designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range.  And I do think it 
could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, 
the very low rates and the downward pressures. 
MICHAEL DERBY.  And will it—do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo 
facility, or that ’s just not even really a focus of what the change was?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It ’s not , honestly.  And , you know, the funny thing, you would think 
that it would, but we ’ll have to see.   It’s, it’s possible that that would not be the case.  That ’s 
going to be an empiric al question.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Okay, cool.  Thank you.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 30 
 MICHELLE SMITH.  We ’ll go to Jeanna  Smialek , the New York Times.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I was 
wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning 
and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, 
as you mentioned, is pretty roiled.  All the data is prett y—has been pretty roiled by the 
pandemic, and we ’re not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we ’re not sure where 
participation is going to settle in.  And wages are already looking, you know, decent.  So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and , and sort of how you’re thinking about 
those wage data.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.   As, as  you well know, there isn’t one indicator we can look 
to, and there ’s no one number that we can therefore point to.  We look at a range of indicators, 
and it ’s a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly—but , but, certainly, it 
will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of 
that.  So how do we think about it?  A couple of things.  We ’re all going to be informed by what 
we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period 
of time.  Now, that hadn’t happened in many other cycles , but this was a very long cycle.  So 
we’re going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again.  It is  a different —it’s  a 
different economy.  We, we have had a slew of retirements , and that may weigh on participation.  
That, that  effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move 
through that window , because they would have —people would have retired anyway, and you’ ll 
be back where you, you would have been.  So I think we ’re—I think that  lesson number one is , is 
just to be careful about assessing maximum employment.  And I think if you—during the last 
cycle, there were —there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 30 
 you know, as , as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed.  And , you know —you know, nine years later —
eight years later, we were still creating jobs.  And , you know, it was quite remarkable.  So we ’re 
all going to be informed by that.  At the same time, we understand this is a different economy.  
You know, the , the demographics are , people are getting older, and that should have a secular 
effect of, of reducing participation over time.  So we have to be sensible about what , what  can be 
done.  But I think we ’re going to be —we’re going to lean into that and be optimistic.  
You asked about  wages.   You know, we ’re seeing wage increases.  That ’s, that’s  sort of a 
natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy.  And what we ’re seeing is —we don’t see 
anything that ’s troubling in the sense of—what would be troubling would be, you know, very 
wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation.  In other words, 
wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across 
the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage –price 
cycle.  That’s, that’s  the old formula for—one of the old formulas for having high inflation.  We 
don’t see anything like that now.  We do see high wages.  We see them for , for people who are 
mostly new, you know, entering into n ew jobs, many of them in low -skilled jobs.  And, but we , 
we do think—you’ve got to—you’ve got to think in the labor market right now, where , where  
supply and demand are just not matched up well.  And, you know, we think it ’s a flexible 
economy and, and it will clear.  There will —there will be a level at which supply and demand 
meet.  And that’ll—we think that ’ll, that’ll  be happening in coming months.  
So—but the last thing I ’ll say is, again, if you look at , at the forecasts, we  are going to be 
in a very st rong labor market pretty quickly here.  There are still a big group of unemployed 
people.  And , you know, we ’re not going to forget about them.  We ’re going—we’re going to do 
everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work.  But there ’s 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 30 
 every reason to think that we ’ll be in a —in a  labor market with very attractive numbers, with low 
unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across  the spectrum.  So that ’s, that’s  a little 
bit how we ’re looking at the —at the labor market.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Hannah Lang at the American 
Banker.  
HANNAH LANG.  Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the 
supplementary leverage ratio right now.  Is the Fed  still thinking about ways to permanently 
adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits?  And do you ultimately believe a 
permanent fix is needed?  And any information on the timing around that would be —would be  
helpful.  
CHAIR POWELL.  What I can say is , we’re working on it.  I don’t have anything to 
share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately.  But we ’ve, 
we’ve  always —our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we’d, we’d like the 
leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.  When leverage requirements 
are, are, are  binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk 
ones.  It ’s a stra ightforward thing.  And because of the substantial increase in reserves, 
Treasuries , and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to be come —
ceasing to be  the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be.  So we do think it’s 
appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we ’re 
looking hard at the issue.  We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions 
are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or rec ommend do not erode the overall 
strength of bank capital requirements.  Sorry, I can’t give you any more.  That’s just something 
we’re working on. 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 30 
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Anneken Tappe  at CNN Business.  
ANNEKEN TAPPE.  Hi there.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chairman Powell, the 
price jumps we ’ve seen in some raw materials —lumber, for example, you mentioned that 
earlier —seem to be easing.  And it looks like we ’re at the beginning of suppliers catching up 
with demand.  But I wonder if you’re worried at all, if we ’re going to end up with excess supply 
immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we ’re 
recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy.  A nd I wonder how that would affect the 
Fed’s outlook at all.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, that is really not the problem we ’re having right now.  But —
and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they 
know that, you know, they don’t want to build , build capacity and then find out that it ’s not 
necessary.  So , really, the problem now is , is that demand is very, very strong.  Incomes are high, 
people have money in their bank accounts.  Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn ’t—
it hasn’t  come down.  We ’re seeing the service sector reopening.  And so you’re seeing prices 
are moving back up off their lows there.  
But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there , there  is a possibility on the other 
side of this tha t, that  inflation could be—could actually be quite low going forward.  But that ’s 
not—that’s not  really where our focus is right now.  Our  focus right now is , we need to —our, 
our expectation is that these , these  high inflation readings that we ’re seeing now will start to 
abate.  And that ’s, that’s  what we think.  And it ’ll be like the lumber experience, and like we 
expect the used car experience to be.  With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the 
other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there ’s no reason to think that they’re going to keep going up 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 30 
 a lot.  Because if they are, people will build new hotels.  There ’s no reason for supply and 
dema nd to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time.  So we think that ’ll 
happen.  
I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there ’s a lot of 
uncertainty.  The overall story is one that , that  we think is right, and we think the incoming data 
support it  and, you know, so do many, many forecasters.  And if you look at the forecasts on the 
FOMC, you will —you will  see that as well.   But we don’t —we don’t  in any way dismiss the 
chance that it can work out that , that  this goes on longer than expected.  And the risk would be 
that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations.  And if we see inflation expectations 
and inflation—or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we —what we  
would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn’t hesitate to use our tools to address that.  Price stability is half of our mandate , and we would certainly do that.  We do not 
expect that , though.  That is not our base case.  
And, and in that we’re joined by many other forecasters, but there ’s a lot to be humble 
about among forecasters.  Forecasters have a lot to be humble about.  It ’s a—it’s a highly 
uncertain business.  And we ’re, we’re  very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data 
carefully.  In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should—as I mentioned earlier, there ’s 
so much uncertainty around this.  It ’s, it’s just a unique situation that we need to see how things 
evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We ’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Sc hneider, Reuters.  Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking 
this.  I don’t want to miss  the moment here.  And I just —I noticed that in the statement you 
dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy.  So is this the 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 30 
 effective end , in your view , of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though 
it’s still cited as a risk?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it ’s a—it’s a continuum, right?  What you’ve seen with 
the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations , and deaths.  And that ’s great.  And , 
and, you know, that  should continue.  But , you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, 
which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they’ve had an outbreak of the 
Delta variety.  And it ’s—and it’s  causing them to have to—to have to react to that.  So you’re 
not—you’re not  out of the woods at this point.  And it would be premature to—in my thinking, it 
would be premature to declare victory.  Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels —it 
would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level.  And , you know, that can only help.  
So, look, I—but you’re right, the statement language is evolving.  I would expect it to 
continue to evolve.  There ’s a lot of judgment in that.  But you can expect us to drag our feet a 
little bit on that, because that ’s what you do with statement language.  It’s, it’s great to see the 
progress.  But , again, I would not declare victory yet.  I would say it is so great to see the 
reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again.  You know, 
who doesn’t want to  see that?  And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to 
continue to get vaccinated.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow up on that, if you—if you view this 
statement in , in toto  and the —and the  dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a 
mark-to -market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see 
developing out there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think it ’s both.  You know, I think, clearly, since March what ’s 
happened is , people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they’ll be 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 30 
 achieved.  Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved.  There ’s, there’s  more 
grounds for comfort.  We ’ve seen growth coming higher than we expected.  We’ve seen very 
strong labor demand.  We ’ve also seen —we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think 
even though, you know, in, in our forecasters ’ case, they do see inflation coming back down over 
’22 and ’23 into, into  areas that are very consistent with our—with our mandate.  Nonetheless, 
the risk is , is something that can factor into people ’s thinking about appropriate monetary policy.  
The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can’t stand here and say exactly 
what was in all 18 people ’s mind s.  But that , that  is something that I think can factor into things 
as well —factor into our forecast as well.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We ’ll go to Victoria Guida with Politico.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I, I want ed to ask a little bit more about inflation 
to make sure I understand how you’re thinking about this.  So in the projections, inflation is 
expected to , to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise 
a little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023.  You know, I know that ’s obviously—you know, 
take that with a grain of salt.  But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation 
sustainably staying above 2 percent .  And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that 
inflation?  What , what  would be —because it seems like you all now see a situation in which 
inflation would be rising in a way that isn’t caused by transitory factors in the —in the  next 
couple of years.  So wou ld that be the result of a tight labor market?  Would that be because this 
whole situation has raised people ’s inflation expectations?  How are you thinking about that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So what we ’re seeing in the near term —again, our base case is that 
what we ’re seeing in the near term is , is principally associated with , with  the reopening of the 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 30 
 economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really.  So —but you’re 
right .  When, when you get to— in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand 
sides of the economy adapt.  We have a very highly adapt ive, you know, flexible economy, more 
so than most.  And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource 
utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a 
way to think about it.  So that ’s what that ’s about.  That’s about the kind of broad inflationary 
pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization 
across the whole economy and lifting, lifting  up inflation.  And that ’s why —that’s why you 
would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast —and it ’s just a forecast , they’re 
just individual forecasts.  In people ’s forecasts, that ’s what ’s happening.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  So the , the, the  change in the projections reflect the fact that you 
all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this 
will change the way people think about inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I think—there may be an element of the latter as well, because 
inflation expectations have continued to move up.  You know, it ’s all in people ’s individual 
thinking, and you can’t —it’s hard to say.  It ’s not something the Committee debates in terms of, 
you know, what , what  the outlook is for 2023.  So I ’m, I’m  a little bit speculating, which I 
shouldn’t do.  But it w ouldn’ t surprise me if there ’s an element for some people in, you know, 
seeing the inflation performance that we ’ve had  and thinking that I have more confidence that we 
could see inflation above 2 percent , that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that 
inflation expectations may move up to a —to a  level —they were —they were  really at a level that 
was kind of a little below 2 percent .  They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a 
consequence of, of, of the new framework.  Yo u know, we did see inflation expectations moving 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 30 
 up in the —in the  wake of the announcement of the framework.  But , you know, we don’t really 
know that.  So, ultimately, I think it ’s consistent with both those things. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.  
GREG ROBB.  Hi .  Hi, thank you for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I’m just looking 
at the forecast , and one thing I just don’t think has been talked about all that much is how much 
you guys —the Fed  thinks that the econom y is going to slow next year.  I mean, are we looking at 
a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation?  And , and what do you think 
about that?  
CHAIR POWELL.   We ’re looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of 
fiscal support .  The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year.  So —but 
you’ve , you’ve  still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the —
of the  economy.  You ’ve got —you’ve got  growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower 
next year in all of our—in all of our forecasts .  I think the range of, of core  PCE forecast for next 
year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023.  So you’re right, you’re seeing —I, I can’t 
remember the number, but it might be in the 3s —3, 3½ percent growth for next year.  That ’s, 
that’s  a really good year—coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, t hat’s a really good 
year.  That ’s, that’s  a year with a lot of momentum.  That’ll see—you know, that ’ll cause 
significant job creation and, and it will—I mean, we would take 3½ percent .  We didn’ t have a 
3½ percent growth year—w e didn’ t have a 3  percent growth year between the G lobal F inancial 
Crisis and the end of the expansion.  So that would be a good year.  
GREGG ROBB.  Doesn ’t it seem like there’s a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation—
where that —you’re going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy’s really, you 
know, dropping in some way.  We haven ’t seen that, right?  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 30 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the economy’s not , not decel —the economy is still growing, 
and growing at a , at a very healthy rate.  Our estimate—I mean, different people have different 
estimates —but , broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at 
around 2 percent  per year.  If you’re growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be 
declining, people should be be ing pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of 
things should be happening, businesses should be investing.  
So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that 
inflation will be higher than we think?  Yes.   As I said earlier, you know, we , we don’t have any 
certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening.  And therefore we 
don’t —we don’t  think that —we think it ’s unlikely that they would materially affect the 
underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century.  The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are 
aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that , that  we think have, 
have, you know, really held down inflation.  All that’s out there still.  You know, when we get through this, we may well —we’ll  be facing those same forces.  Nonetheless, is there a ri sk that 
inflation will remain higher than we —than we thought?  Yes.  And if, if we see inflation moving 
above our goals in, in a time—sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently —or persistently 
enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tool s to address that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Going to Brian Che ung with Yahoo.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Chair Powell, Brian Che ung, Yahoo Finance.  On that point, you 
talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity.  I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5  percent .  But there ’s been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 30 
 could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe 
changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher.  What would the 
implications of that be for monetary policy?   Do you think that maybe the Fed  could have the 
possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate?  And what might be the impact of that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher 
by that amount.  And , and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, 
because it would give the Fed  more room to cut rates.  The problem with , with  interest rates 
being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn—for example, a pandemic.  And if you look, for example, at the European Central 
Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero whe n, when the pandemic hit.  So we don’t 
want to be in a place where we can ’t react.  A higher neutral rate would, would be —from that 
narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us.  It would give us more room and, therefore , 
then, that would tend to result  in better outcomes for the economy over time.  You know, we, 
it’s—you can’t estimate it with great—with great  precision.  I think we would be alert to—I 
mean, studying r* is a—is a  whole industry unto itself.  And I, I think we would be alert to 
factors t hat might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest.  And, you know, we , we try to keep up 
with that.  And I think we ’re, we’re, we’re  all thinking about that and the possibility of that.  You 
know, there are many—there are a lot of stories right now that could —that essentially could lead 
to higher productivity growth and higher r*.  We don’ t know which of those stories will come 
true.  But , I mean, I’ll give you an example.  It ’s just there are—there are  a lot of start -ups, a lot 
of early-stage companies.  And is that going to have that effect?  We don’t know.  But we ’ll be 
watching those things carefully.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 30 
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  For the last question, we ’ll go to Michael 
McKee at Bloomberg TV.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, of c ourse you’ll be shocked to learn that you have 
some critics on Wall Street.  And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get 
your reaction to them.  One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and 
do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you’re relying on the 
forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy.  I wanted to get your view on how you square that.  Another is that you have a long runway, you’ve said, for tapering with 
announcements.  But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a 
taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper?  And , finally, 
you’ve said the Fed  knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy.  
And there ’s a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to 
raise rates too quickly.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that ’s a—that’s a  few questions there.  So let me say , first, I think 
people misinterpret the framework.  I think the —there ’s nothing wrong with the framework, a nd 
there ’s nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to 
pursue our, our goals.  That ’s for starters.  All of our discussions and all of our thinking and 
planning are taking place in the context of our new framework.  We ’re strongly committed to it, 
we think it ’s well suited to our goals, including in this —in this  unique time.  And I think if you 
look at the —look at the  forecasts that we ’ve written down, you know, our Committee is solidly 
behind them.  The forecasts are all consistent with that.  
You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve?  And, you 
know, that ’s, that’s  not the situation we’re facing at all.  The situation that we, we  addressed in 
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 30 
 our—in our S tatement on L onger-Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy was a situation in 
which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low.  And what we  said was, we 
wouldn’t raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if 
there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances.  So that ’s what we said.  
That is not at all the current situation.   In the current si tuation, we have many millions of 
people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target.  The question 
we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework.  It ’s a very different, very 
difficult version of a standard i nvestment —sorry, a central banking question.  And that is, how 
do you separate in inflation—how do you separate things that , that  follow from broad upward 
price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a 
particular —due to particular things?  I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, 
was the cellphone price war back in 2017.  If you remember, there was —prices were incredibly 
low, and it held down core PCE by three -tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out.  So 
this is much bigger than that.  And , of course, it ’s not —it’s not  easy to tell in real time which is 
which, but that ’s, that’s  the question you would face under, really , any framework.  And, you 
know, we ’re trying to sort that out.  I’ve tried to, to explain that today about how we think about 
that.  And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they’ll wane.  We 
can’t be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we ’re prepared to use our tools as 
appropriate.  
Your second one was?  Oh , you know, we will —we will  taper when we feel that the 
economy has achieved substantial furthe r progress.  And we will communicate very carefully in 
advance on that.  And that ’s what we ’re doing.  That ’s what we ’re going to do, and, and we will 
follow through on that.  There ’s no —I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction.  
June 16, 2021    Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 30 of 30 
 But, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will —we will  taper as 
appropriate.  
The third thing was —what was the third thing?  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy.  
And the history of the Fed  is that sometimes you go too far.  
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s right.  And we —look, we have to balance the two —the two  
goals:  maximum employment and price stability.  Often they are—they do pull in the sam e 
direction, of course.  But when we —when we  raise interest rates to control inflation, there ’s no 
question that has an effect on activity.  And that ’s the channel —one of the channels through 
which we get to inflation.  We don’t think that we’re in a situa tion like that right now.  We think 
that the economy is recovering from a deep hole —an unusual hole , actually, because it ’s to do 
with, with  shutting down the economy.  It turns out it ’s a heck of a lot easier to create demand 
than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff.  That ’s happening all over the world.  
There ’s no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely.  But  we’re going, you know, 
we’re going to watch carefully to make sure that , that  evolving inflation and our understanding 
of what ’s happening is , is, is  right.  And in the meantime, we ’ll conduct policy appropriately.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you, Mr. Chair.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s  Press Conference 
July 28, 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero  and maintained 
our asset pur chases.  These measures, along with our strong guidance on interest rates and on our 
balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete.  
Progress in  vaccinations  and unprecedented fiscal poli cy actions are also providing strong 
support to the recovery.  Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to 
strengthen , and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in 
decades.  Much of this rapid growth reflects the continued bounceback in activity from depressed 
levels.  
The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have 
not fully recovered.  Household spending is rising at an especially rapid pace, boosted by the 
ongoing reopening of the economy and ongoing policy support .  The  housing sector remains 
very strong, and business investment is increasing at a solid pace.  In some industries, near -term 
supply constraints are restraining activity.  These constraints are pa rticularly acute in the motor 
vehicle industry, where worldwide shortage s of semiconductors ha ve sharply curtailed 
production so far this year.  
As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to 
improve.  Demand for labor is very strong, and employment rose 850,000 in June, with the 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 29  
 leisure and hospitality sector continuing to post notable gains.  Nonetheless, the labor market has 
a ways to  go. 
The unemployment rate in June —in June  was 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the 
shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.  Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments, appear to be weighing on employment growth.  These factors should wane in coming months, leading to strong gains in employment.  
The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able t o 
shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower- wage workers in the service sector and on African Americans 
and Hispanics.  
Inflation has increased notably and will lik ely remain elevated in coming months before 
moderating.  As the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward 
pressure on prices, particularly because supply bottlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly production can respond in the  near term.  These bottleneck effects have been larger than 
anticipated, but as these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal.  Very low readings from early in the pandemic as well as the pas s-through 
of past increases in oil prices to consumer  energy prices also contribute to the increase, although 
these base effects and energy effects are receding . 
The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the 
onset of the  pandemic.  As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other 
constraints could continue to limit how quickly supply can adjust, raising the possibility that 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 29  
 inflation  could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect.  O ur new framework for 
monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having well -anchored inflation expectations, both 
to, to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to promote our broad -based and inclusive 
maximum -employment goal.  
Indicators of lon g-term inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer-
run inflation goal of 2 percent.  If we saw signs that the path of inflation or longer -term inflation 
expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal, 
we’d be prepared to adjust the stance of policy.  
The effects of the pandemic on the economy have continued to diminish, but risks to the 
economic outlook remain.  Progress on vaccinations has limited the spread of COVID -19.  
However, the pace of  vaccinations has slowed, and the D elta strain  of the virus  is spreading 
quickly in some areas.  Continued progress on vaccinations would support a return to more 
normal economic conditions . 
The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  As the Committee reiterated in today’s policy statement, with inflation having run persistently below 2  percent, we will aim to achieve inflation 
moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2  percent over time and 
longer -term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2  percent.  We expect to maintain an 
accommodative stance of m onetary policy until these employment and inflation outcomes are 
achieved.  
With regard to interest rates, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain 
the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market co nditions 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 29  
 have reached level —levels consistent with the Committee’s assessment of maximum 
employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2  percent 
for some  time.  
In addition, we are continuing to—continuing to increase our holdings of Treasury 
securities by at least $80  billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month 
until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum- employment and price -
stability goals.  Our asset purchas es have been a critical tool.  They helped preserve financial 
stability and market functioning early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster 
accommodative financial conditions to support the economy.  
At our meeting that concluded earlier today, t he Committee continued to discuss  the 
progress made toward our —toward our  goals since the Committee adopted it s asset purchase 
guidance last December.   We also reviewed some considerations around how our asset purchases 
might be adjusted, including their pace and composition, once economic conditions warrant a 
change.  Participants expect that the economy will continue to move toward our standard of  
“substantial further progress .”  In coming meetings , the Committee will again assess the 
economy’s progress toward our goals , and the timing of any change in the pace of our asset 
purchases will depend on the incoming data.  As we ’ve said, w e will provide advance notice 
before  making any changes to our purchases.  
On a final note, we announced the establishment of two standing repo facilities, a 
domestic one for primary dealers and additional banks and another for foreign and international monetary authorities.  These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of mo netary policy and smooth market functioning. 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 29  
 To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Steve Liesman with CNBC. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Chairman , I wonder if you might be  
able to put some, I don’ t know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of 
“substantial further progress. ”  What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or , or, or  
citing data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today?  And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Great.  Thank you.  So more deta il on substantial further progress.  
So let’s talk about the maximum -employment part of that.  As you know, with maximum 
employment —unlike with, with  price stability , where we can target a number of 2 percent  on 
average—with maximum employment, there isn ’t a single number that we can target.  That the —
we monitor a broad range of , of, of  data about different aspects of the labor market.  There ’s 
unemployment, unemployment among different , different age groups , and such.  There ’s 
participation.  There ’s wages.  There ’s all kinds of flow data.  And we look at all of it to try to 
arrive at a picture of what—of what  is maximum employment.  
So there isn ’t—I can ’t give you a , a, a  set of numbers —for example, a numerical 
threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was.  We didn’ t do that here.  What we 
said was substantial further progress toward our goals.  And what we said was, we would keep, 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 29  
 effectively, we ’d—we would give advance  warning as we —and, and, you know, more and more 
clarity —as, as we move forward.  And that ’s what we ’re going to try to do. 
So what would substantial further progress be?  I’d say we have some ground to cover 
on, on the labor market side.  I think we ’re, we’re some way away from , from  having had 
substantial further progress with , with  max —toward the maximum -employment goal.  I would 
want to see some strong job numbers.  And , and that ’s, that’s  kind of the idea. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation.  
You didn’ t—does it mean you feel like you’ ve reached your goal when it comes to the inflation 
side?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So inflation is running well above our 2 percent  objective and ha s 
been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months 
before we believe it ’ll, it’ll  move back down toward our objective.  The question whether we ’ve 
met that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make.  I can ’t—I can ’t do that by 
myself.  But it ’s clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2  percent.   And , and, 
again, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target.  
MICHE LLE SMITH.  Thank you.  A nn Saphir with Reuters.  
ANN SAPHIR.  Hello.  Can you hear me?  [No response]  Hello.  Can you hear me?  I’m 
sorry.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, yes.  We can hear you.  
ANN SAPHIR.  I apologize.  I —just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you 
know, is it —is it correct to see this as the, the start of the advance notice process, you know, 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 29  
 before a taper?  And , and , and also, can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into 
your thinking on, on the taper ?  Thanks. 
CHAI R POWELL.  So, as you know, we ’re, we’re  in a process now where what we said 
is that as —at this meeting and in coming meetings, we ’re going to be continuing to assess the 
economy’ s progress toward our goals and give advance notice.  We’ ll be—try to provide  
additional clarity about our thinking, both in the —in the  postmeeting statement and in the 
minutes and in the public comments that people make.  
You know, our , our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can.  We have not 
reached substantial furt her progress yet.  So we ’re, we’re  not there, and we see our ways as 
having some —we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there.  So that ’s what I 
would say.  
In terms of —in terms of, of  COVID and the Delta strain, I ’ll say a couple things.  Of 
course, it will have significant health consequences for many.  And we need to keep that in mind 
before we start —before we mention and move to the economic questions.  This is a— rising 
cases in , in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite 
significantly.  We’ ll see. 
What we’ ve seen, though, is with successive waves of , of COVID over the past year and 
some months now, there has tended to be less economic —less in the way of economic 
implications from each wave.  And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.  
But it’ s, you know, it ’s a—it’ s certainly a—not an unreasonable expectation. 
So it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from  some activities because of 
the risk of infection.  Dining out, traveling, schools might —some schools might not reopen.  We 
may just —we may see economic effects from some of that, or it might weigh on , on the return to 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 29  
 the labor market.  Some people might choose —again, we , we don’ t have a strong sense of how 
that might work out, so we ’ll just be monitoring it—monitoring it carefully.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.   In your 
opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above 
2 percent  this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent  for some 
time, and I noticed you didn’ t repeat that qualification last month or today.  And , and so, in your 
view, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2  percent  for 
some  time?  
CHAIR POWELL .  That , that  would, again, be a quest ion for the Committee.  But I 
would really say , the guidance that you’ re talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff, 
right?  That ’s—what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions 
consistent with full employment, infla tion at 2  percent  and on track to run —to run moderately 
above 2 percent  for some time.  It really isn ’t relevant now.  It—because we’ re really —we ’re 
looking at , at tapering asset purchases.  
We’re clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates.  It ’s not something 
that, that is on our radar screen right now.  You know, so when we get to that question, when we 
start to get to the question of , of liftoff, which , which  we are not at all at now or near n ow, that ’s 
when we ’ll ask that question.  That is when that , that  will become a real question for us.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Jeanna Smialek  at the New York Times.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  I wonder 
if you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting  [inaudible].   You know, does that affect , 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 29  
 affect how you’ re thinking about tapering?  Does it affect how you ’re thinking about, you know, 
potential liftoff down the road?  And if you could, just talk a little bit about that.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Jeanna, I ’m sorry.  For the first 15  seconds of your question, you 
froze.  Could you—could you say that again?   I apologize.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Oh, ye s.  No.  Sorry.  Ye s.  So I was wondering if you could talk a 
little bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we ’re 
seeing around the world impacts how the F ed thinks about its policies.  So do you take into 
account that sort of multispeed recovery when you’ re thinking about tapering QE, and do you 
take, take  it into account when you’ re thinking about liftoff?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So it ’s an—it’s an important feature of this re covery is how 
uneven it is.  And , in many cases, that ’s related to the fact that some countries have had little in 
the way of access to , to vaccines.  And so they’ re seeing significant outbreaks, and it ’s weighing 
on economic activity, whereas other countries—such as the United States, in particular —are 
having a very strong rebound.  And , and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well.  
So it’s a feature of our economy.  Now, how does it affect our policy?  In, in a couple of 
ways, potentially.  One just is that, in general, economies —and through financial markets and 
through trade —are, are  deeply interconnected now.  And so a stronger global economy will lead 
to more U .S. exports.  And , and, you know, that ’ll help economic activity.   To the extent the  
global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it ’ll—we ’ll wind up , you know, we ’ll 
wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having , having a lot 
of exports.  That’s one  way.  
Another way, though, is more on the risk side.  And that is, as long as COVID is running 
loose out there, as long as there ’s time and space for the development of new strains, no one’ s 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 29  
 really finally safe.  These , these strains —there ’s no reason they just can ’t keep coming and one, 
you know, one more powerful than the next.  We don’ t know that.  But that’ s, that’s, that’s  
certainly a plausible outcome.  Now, as , as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our 
economic activity.  But, you know, it , it is both the right thing to do and, and  very much in our 
interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  James at the FT.  
JAMES POLITI.  Thank you very much.  Chair Powell, how would you describe the 
risks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected?  
Do you believe the risks  are, you know, tilted to the upside?  And does the Committee share that 
view?  Or are they in balance?  Are you s till worried that there could be a hit to demand from, 
from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again?  If you could give us a 
sense of that, that would be very helpful.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  I ’d be glad to.  So if you look, agai n, if you look at the , the 
most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected.  
But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories.  It isn ’t the kind of 
inflation that’ s spread broadly across the economy.  It’ s new, used , and rental cars .  It’s airplane 
tickets .  It’s hotels .  And it’s a couple of other things.  And each of those has a story attached to it 
that is —that  is really about the reopening of the economy.  
So we look at that , and we think that those are temporary things because the , the supply 
side will respond.  The economy will adapt.  We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market.  And it ’s a real —a real asset that we have.  And so we think that 
inflation should move down over time.  Now, we don’ t have any—much confidence, let ’s say, in 
the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term.  I would say, in the near term, that 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 29  
 the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside.  I , I, I have some confidence in  the—in 
the medium term, that inflation will move back down.  Again, it ’s hard to say when that w ill be. 
I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we —inflation is half of our mandate.  Price 
stability is half of our mandate.  And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently 
that were—that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were  to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent . 
So we won ’t have an extended period of , of high inflation.  We think that , that  some of it 
will, will  fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through.  And it 
could take some time.   In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure 
that we do have inflation that averages 2  percent  over time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Victoria at Politico.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Mr. Chairman.  So b ond market pricing seems to suggest that 
investors think the F ed might eventually overtighten.  So my question is, do you think that 
markets have bought into the central bank’ s new framework?  And how do you balance that with 
managing inflation concerns?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so in terms of what’ s been happening in bond markets, I don’ t 
think there ’s a real consensus on , on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this 
meeting.  We ’ve seen the long- term yields go down significantly.  Some of it is a fall in real 
yields, which may have been connected to—some speculate —connected to sentiment around the , 
the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth.  
There was also some decli ne in inflation compensation, which ha s significantly reversed.  
And there , there  are also so -called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can ’t 
quite explain.  So I , I, I don’t see in any of that that there is really anything that chal lenges the 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 29  
 credibility of our framework, if, if  that’s really your question.  We are committed to achieving 
2 percent  average inflation over time.  
What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels 
of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won’ t be enough for us to raise interest rates 
until we see some inflation.  Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite.  We’ve got, 
you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people , at work than were at work before the  pandemic.  
So we ’re, you know, we ’re, we’re  a ways away from full maximum employment.  But we have 
high inflation, so it ’s kind of the opposite case.  And we have to—we have to deal w ith that.  
Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is 
broad based and likely to be persistent and , and, and whether inflation expectations are 
implicated in a way that , that  could cause them to rise.  So we ’re monitoring that very carefully, 
and we ’re prepared to use our too ls as appropriate.  But, again, I think our —I think our 
framework is pretty well  understood.  And , and I think the real test of it will be down the road 
when it ’s time to think about raising interest rates and , and how we assess, assess that set of 
issues.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Rich at Bloomberg.  
RICH MILLER.   Thanks very much, Michelle.  Chairman Powell, you, you  just alluded 
to the fact that you ’re prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to—if 
inflation looks like  it’s getting out of control.  I want to just try to understand that in the context 
of the framework and the forward guidance.  Does that mean you’ d be prepared to raise interest 
rates even if we’ re not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of 
inflation?  And , and, two, does it also mean you’ d be prepared to raise interest rates even if you 
are still buying assets?  Thank you. 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So there ’s a—there ’s a part in our S tatement on L onger -Run G oals 
and, and M onetary P olicy S trategy, which, Rich, I ’m sure —I’m sure  you’ re familiar with, which , 
which  talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension.  M ost of the time, if you have 
high inflation, you also have  high employment —they, they tend to go together.  This is a 
situation where they ’re temporarily in different directions.  We’re not at full employment, but we 
are having high inflation. 
We feel like we’ re going to be making good progress over the next —over  the course of 
the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment.  This is a very strong labor 
market.  If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we ’re, we’re  clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low 
unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum .  That, that’s,  that’s the 
path that we ’re on, and, and it shouldn’ t take that long in macroeconomic time to ge t there.  
So that ’s, that’s  what I think is , is really the likely case.  And, again, it ’s not —it’s not  
timely for us to be thinking about , about  raising interest rates right now.  What we’ re doing is , 
we’re, we’re  looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and 
judging how we —how close we are to substantial further progress and then—and then tapering 
after that.  
The question you asked about , would we raise rates if we hadn ’t finished cutting —hadn’ t 
finished the taper, hypothetica l question.  You know, we ’d, we’d face the circumstance at th e 
time.  We could always just —you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset 
purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that.  But it ’s, it’s, it’s  just hard to —it’ s hard to 
answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation.  Ideally, you wouldn’ t be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you ’re adding 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 29  
 accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates.  So that wouldn’ t 
be ideal.  I ’ll say  that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Edward Lawrence at  Fox Business.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So t hank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for 
taking the question.  Now , so you’ re talking about jobs.  You just said we ’re on a path to a very 
strong job market.  You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor 
market survey and 9.2 million job openings.  So what ’s the—what ’s the disconnect?  Is it a skills 
gap?  Is it the extended unemployment benefits?  Is it the fact that people just aren ’t willing to 
relocate?  What is the disconnect there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It’ s a—it ’s a really unusual situation to have —to have the ratio of 
vacancies to unemployed be this high.  And we think there are a number of things at work there.  
Maybe the place to start is, is  just to say that this is n ow not so much about people going back to 
their old jobs.  It’ s about finding a new job.  So that ’s a time- intensive, labor -intensive process.  
And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that.  There, there’ s research that suggests that 
there is a speed lim it on that.  So it ’s not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of 
the recovery going back in a single month because they’ re just going back to their old job.  This 
is about job selection, things like that.  There may also be some factors th at are —that are holding 
people back, and that ’s—this is what surveys say.  There are people who, who  are reluctant to go 
back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID.  These could be jobs where , where  there 
was a lot of , of interaction with the public and where perhaps there ’s a family member who ’s 
vulnerable or for whatever reason.  
There ’s also caretakers who are—where , where  schools are not fully open and parents are 
at home or taking care of , of, of  older people.  And there ’s also been very generous 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 29  
 unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off.  T hey’ll be —they’ll be fully rolled off in a 
couple of months.  And  all of th ose factors should , should wane.  And, you know, we , we think 
we should see , because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward.  
I mean, ultimately, it’ s unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context 
where there are that m any unemployed people.  That many job openings would typically suggest 
a tight labor market.  And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it ’s very 
hard to hire people.  And that may be because people , people are shopping carefully for their 
next job.  I mean, I , I, I think the bottom line on this is , people want to work.  If you look at 
where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire.  Some 
people will retire.  But, generally speaking, Americans  want to work, and, and they’ ll find their 
way into the jobs that they want.  It may take some time, though.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our 
questions.  I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of 
economic implications from each wave of COVID cases.  Could you elaborate on what you’ ve 
seen to that end during pre vious waves?  And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor 
market to the Delta variant?  
I’m thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in 
travel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering the ir travel plans or if 
caretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening .  How do you see 
some of those risks going forward?  Thank you so much.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So if you remember the , the summer wave last year of 
COVID, which was largely southern and w estern states, the economy just performed much better 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 29  
 than anyone expected.  You know, we , we were coming off the spring wave , where there were a 
lot of shutdowns.  And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to 
expect that , that it would have a real impact on the economy.  And i t was much less than , than 
people thought. 
People —what ’s happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated.  They ’re going on 
with their lives.  Secondly, we ’ve kind of lea rned to live with it.  A lot of industries have , have  
kind of improvised their way around it —particularly, for example, buying a new home .  That , 
that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process.  And so they were able to , you know, to, to do that.  And other industries as well have gone to take -out 
and, you know, no- contact things.  It ’s—so that can all —it seem s like we’ ve learned to , to 
handle this . 
Now, I think people would like to get back to, to , you know, the way things were.  And I , 
I, I hope to some extent, we will over time.  You know, of course, the big wave we had last 
winter did have significant emplo yment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure 
and other entertainment —other , other  areas with a lot of direct contact.  A lot of jobs were lost 
then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last yea r, just 
before the vaccines arrived.  
So with Delta, we ’re just going to have to watch.  Again, with , with, with  a reasonably 
high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective —we ’re not 
experts on this —but it , it seems like the—a  good —a good going- in estimate would be that the 
effects will probably be less.  There probably won’ t be significant lockdowns and things like 
that.  But, again, those , those  are not decisions for us or , or, or —nor is it something we ’re be —
we’d be expert in.  
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 29  
 In terms of the , the, the  channels, you know, I —this is —this is kind of speculation, but 
it’s pretty —it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or 
two for the —for the —for the  Delta wave to go .  I’m not saying this ’ll happen, but that it ’s easy 
to imagine that.  It’s also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what?  I ’m just 
going to—I ’m just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work.  Wouldn’ t be 
hard to imagine tha t happening.  
If, if schools don’ t open, then caretakers have to stay home.  And if people don’ t go back 
into the labor force, then the job growth won’ t be as strong, those kinds of things.  So I don’ t—it 
doesn’ t—it doesn’t —again, sitting here today , not being able to really know the future —it 
doesn’ t seem as though the effects will be very large.  But there may be effects.  And they—it 
may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months —or not.  There 
are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we ’re just going to have to, 
to see what the economic effects are.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to David Gura at NPR. 
DAVID GURA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was going to ask if you’ ve started dr afting 
your Jackson Hole speech, but I ’m going to go in a —in a  different direction here.  Steve 
Liesman ask ed you about semantics.  I’m going to take a cue from him and ask you about the 
term “ transitory ,” because I think of you as somebody who’ s so lucidly explained policies and 
programs in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to , to the American 
public as a whole.  I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don’ t know 
it definitionally, don ’t know what it means , and see prices going up and wonder how long they ’re 
going to have to wait.  
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 29  
 So just some broader definition from you—I ’d like to hear just about what it means or 
how you understand it.  And, and quickly a s well, you’ ve talked about vaccines a bit.  And your 
colleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that 
Federal Reserve Bank.  And I wonder if that ’s something that you would like to see or expect to 
see S ystemwide going forward.  
CHAIR POWELL.  The concept of “transitory ” is really this:  It is that the increases will 
happen.  We ’re not saying they will reverse.  That ’s not what “transitory ” means.  It means that 
the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will 
stop so that —so that there won’ t be further—when , when we think of inflation, we really think 
of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year.  That ’s inflation.  
When you have inflation for 12 mo nths or whatever it might be —I’m just taking an 
example ; I’m not making an estimate —then, then  you have a price increase, but you don’ t have 
an inflation process.  And so part of that just is that, if it doesn ’t affect longer- term inflation 
expectations, t hen it ’s very likely not to infect —to affect the process of inflation going forward.  
So what , what  I mean by “transitory ” is just something that doesn ’t leave a permanent 
mark on the inflation process.  Again, we don’ t mean —I don’ t mean that,  that, that, t hat, you 
know, producers are going to take those price increases back.  That’s, that’s  not the idea.  It’s just 
that they won’ t go on indefinitely.  So to the extent people are , are, are implementing price 
increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something ’s going up, you know, 
the question,  really , for inflation really is, does that mean they ’re going to go up the next year by 
the same amount?  
So you’ re going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process , gets going.  And, 
and that happens because people ’s expectations about future inflation move up.  And we don’ t 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 29  
 think that ’s happening.  There ’s no evidence that it ’s happening.  All the evidence is that it’s not 
happening.  But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is —you know, 
we have two mandates:   maximum employment and price stability.  Price stability , for us , means 
inflation averaging 2 percent  over time.  And so we ’ve got to be very careful about  that.  
But, but I, I, I think it ’s a good point that it ’s, it’s a term —what it really means is 
temporary.  But then you’ ve got to understand that it doesn’ t mean that the —that the  increases 
will be taken back.  Some of them will be, but, but that’s not really what it means.  
In terms of —so we ’re, we’re  working virtually here, and we ’ll be coming back down the 
road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the B oard of G overnors in 
Washington.  And, you know, we ’re going to follow public health guidance  and things like that.  
We really haven ’t made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like.  And 
it’ll depend on, to some extent , on what —on what , you know, CDC guidance  looks like when we 
actually do bring people back in.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Chairman, I want ed to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline 
in the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data.  And the statement says that 
the Fed  is going to use —to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and 
inflation, in coming meetings.  Does that suggest that we wouldn’ t see anything before 
September or November in your meetings?  And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have basically felt you ’re going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole.  Is that —is that the plan, 
or are we not going to see anything until the fall?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not —if I— if I said 
we’re looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn’t—I ’m not meaning to suggest 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 29  
 anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really h ave not made that 
decision.  All I ’m saying is , is, we’re not at substantial further progress.  There ’s a range of 
views on, on what timing will be appropriate.  And those views ultimately track , track  back to 
people ’s views about the economy and, and what  will happen as we make progress toward s, 
towards our —towards our goal.  
So that ’s, that’s  really what it is.  And I , I—we will, of course, as we—you know, we ’re 
going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on  timing, pace , and composition.  
But, today, I ’ve, I’ve  given you what I can give you because, again, this , this  was the first , really , 
I would say,  deep dive on the issues of timing, pace , and composition.  And it was a good 
meeting.  And —but no decisions are made, and, and I ’m just not in a position to, to give you 
much guidance, really any guidance , on the actual timing.  
I—but I will say we ’re making progress.  We expect further progress.  And we expect 
that, if, if  things go well, then we will —we will reach that goal .  And when we reach it and the 
Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then , then we’ll taper at that point.  I can’t, I 
really —there ’s nothing I can say about Jackson Hole.  You know, I ’m in—we ’re in the process 
of writing that speech.  And I am going to give a speech, and —but I , I, I wouldn’ t want to —I 
wouldn’ t want to say what will be in there at this point.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that 
the Fed has got the markets working well.  And you’ ve got bank loans up.  In other words, 
you’ve stimulated demand.  But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension 
funds , are getting hammered by the low rates.  And they’ re wondering if the bal ance hasn ’t 
started to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good. 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  W e—asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the 
critical phase of the crisis.  They , they  really helped us restore market function to these key 
markets, really, on which—on which , which  are very, very important to our economy and the 
global economy.  And then they were a big part of , of creating accommodative financial 
conditions to support demand.  They were strongly needed.  
It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the 
economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now.  So 
we said we would taper when we —when we  achieve substantial further progres s.  And , and, you 
know, we ’re going to honor that commitment.  I mean, it ’s—and, and, again, we ’re talking about 
it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction.  We will taper when we 
reach that goal.  And we ’ll provide more , you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is 
appropriate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. 
HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  You ’ve been asked a lot previously i f the Fed ’s monetary policy 
at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed ’s 
regulatory policy lands , particularly if you think that the Fed ’s bank capital requirements have 
had the effect of penalizing lower -income households seeking loans.  Basically, is it possible to 
achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, 
particula rly for the largest banks.  And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we ’ve 
seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most —mostly, or to , to the greatest extent, to 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 29  
 people at the lower end of the income spectrum.  So if you look back at not this previous —not 
this crisis but the previous one, the bank—the banking system was undercapitalized.  
So higher capital requirements are , are, you know, are , are really a good thing because 
they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform.  
I think it ’s other tools that we have to —and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some 
of these tools , other agencies have some of these tool s—to assure or support the wide availability 
of credit, particularly to low - and moderate -income communities.  
So that ’s CRA.  We enforce CRA.  We’ re working on a —on a  new CRA proposal right 
now with the other banking agencies, and we think it ’s going to be —it’s going to be good and 
will support the flow of credit to low - and moderate -income households.  It ’s also the anti —anti –
lending discrimination statutes that we enforce .  And it’s some of the programs that Congress has 
in place to support the flow of cr edit to low - and moderate -income communities.  I , I don’ t think 
it’s capital standards at all.  I think capital standards work the other way.  Strong capital is what 
enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low - and moderate -income 
communities.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Chris Rugaber at the AP. 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Hi.  Thank you for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I 
guess I wanted to ask about the last —when you were before Congress earlier this month, you 
mentioned, I think, something along the lines of , it won ’t take too long before we see if you’ re 
right about inflation and its temporary aspect.  You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy.  Can you tell us a li ttle more of what you mean by that?  
When do you think you’ ll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions 
that we ’re seeing now ? 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So with inflation, as I mentioned, we’re , we look not just at 
the headline number , but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation.  
And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that , widely , across the whole 
range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we ’re seeing  upward , upward pressure 
on prices.  That ’s not really what we ’re seeing.  
What we’ re seeing is a handful of things that are really —that really account for the , the 
overshoot of inflation.  And , as I mentioned, it’ s things like cars.  You know, new, used , and 
rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor 
shortage.  And housing —sorry, hotels and air , air fares have moved back up, but that really just 
is retracing the very large downward movement in prices t hat they had before.  
So that ’s, that’s  a big, big part of , of why the inflation readings are so high.  And those 
don’t—those , frankly , don ’t carry significant implications in the long run for the —for inflation 
or for the American economy.  So what I said w as, we, we’re going to see whether these 
things —we don’ t need to see everything do what lumber prices have done.  So if you look at 
lumber prices, they went up and then they went down. 
So what we want to see is these other things.  D o they—do they—do the prices flatten 
out?  Do they actually move down?  If they flatten out, then their , their contribution to inflation 
becomes zero over time so that they ’re not contributing to inflation.  And so, if we start to see 
those things happen fairly widely among the —among the things that have really moved up 
quickly, then we ’ll, we’ll —they won ’t all happen at once or happen quickly—but we ’ll know 
that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct.  
And I don’ t think it will take , or what I said was , I don’ t think it’ ll take a very long time 
to see whether that ’s the case.  It, it, it  is probably the case that, frankly, the , the overall 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 29  
 reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time.   This is a historic, world 
historical event , that the global economy is now reopening.  It’s not going to—it ’s not going to 
happen quickly.  It ’s going to take some time.  
And it ’s going to be very uneven, as we discussed before.  But I think we will—we will  
know, you know, when we know.  But I don’ t think it will take that long.  I don’ t want to put a 
number on it.  But I do think that , that , if we see those things happening, we ’ll know that we 
have the story basically right.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  I ’m just 
wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you’ re thinking about 
mortgage -backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper.  Withi n the context of home 
prices continuing to rise, we ’ve heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they’ d like to 
cool off on, specifically , the MBS purchases.  Is that more because of the opt ics, or is it because 
there ’s an observed relationship from the Committee ’s view between MBS purchases under QE 
and the hot housing market?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So a number of participants raised that —the questions around MBS 
and tapering at , at today’ s meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday ’s meeting.  And I ’ll just say 
that, generally speaking, I don’ t think and—I don’ t think that —I think th at Treasury and MBS 
purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways.  There may be modest differences in 
terms of , of contribution to housing prices, but it ’s, it’s not something that ’s big. 
It’s not —it’s—so where I think we are is , there , there  really is little support for the idea 
of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries.  I think we will taper them at the same time.  It seems 
likely, based on where people are now.  The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 29  
 faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people —others , not so much.  
And I think it ’s something that we ’ll be continuing to discuss. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Michael Derby. 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you very much.  So I wanted to ask you about the standi ng 
repo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions.  And 
also, kind of in a  similarly  related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger 
since you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting.  And, you know, are you concerned 
to see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do?  So it , it 
really is a backstop.  So it ’s, it’s set at 25  basis points , so out of the money, and it ’s, it’s there to 
help address pressures in money market —money markets that could impede the effectiv e 
implementation of monetary policy.  So, really, it ’s, it’s to support the function of —functioning 
of monetary policy and its , its effectiveness.  That ’s the purpose of it.  And it ’s set up with that 
purpose in mind.  
Your question on, on the , the [ON] RRP,  so we think it ’s doing what it ’s supposed to do, 
what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds  rate stays within the target range.  You know, it ’s essentially , 
essentially , what ’s happening is that it just results in a  lower aggregate amount of Federal 
Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight R RP balances.  
So that , that ’s all that ’s really happening there.  And we expect it to be high for some 
time.  It ’s being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and, 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 29  
 and also  the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that.  So we don’ t—
we don’t  have a problem with, with  what it ’s doing.  It ’s kind of doing the job we expected . 
MICHAEL DERBY.  And you don’ t see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know , 
markets from, you know, investing in private money market securities?  You know, like , the idea 
that the Fed’s footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don’ t see any issues there?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Not , not really.  Not at this point.  I mean, money markets, private  
money market funds are , are choosing to, to  invest because the rates are attractive.  At some 
point, the rates will not be so attractive as , as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and , and you’ ll 
see it shrink back down. 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Okay.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Let ’s go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch.  
GREG ROBB.  Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  Chair Powell, I was going to go 
back to inflation a little bit.  I ’m just kind of surprised by your tone.  It , it seems like you ’re just 
sort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed  will act.  Isn’t it true that, I 
mean, a little inf lation is good for the economy and, and that we —if somehow maybe we can get 
the economy out of this sort of place where we ’re always going to be  close to the zero lower 
bound, i sn’t there a good story to tell,  and you’ re sort of panicking people?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I certainly don ’t, don’t  have that in mind.  No.  Look, we—as you 
know, we ’re targeting a moderate overshoot of 2  percent  inflation for some time.  We, we want 
inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent .  We feel like they may be a little bit below 
that.  So the bigger picture is that, you know, that , that, that  would be a healthy thing.  This is a 
different thing.  This is —this is not that.  Th at was the kind of inflation we were thinking about 
that comes from, you know , from a very, very strong labor market and a —and a  booming 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 29  
 economy maybe.  T hat, that was the kind of inflation —this, this  is something different.  This is 
really driven by the s upply side, which is not able to hand—to handle this big spike in demand 
that we ’re seeing.  As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary 
policy support, the supply side —just all over the world , you’ re seeing the same thing, whic h is, it 
just can ’t keep up.  And there are labor shortages in , in a lot of places, the same sort of thing.  
So, you know, there ’s, there’s absolutely no sense of panic.  I just— I’ve explained, I 
think, several times here today that the best— my, my best estimate is that this is something that 
will pass.  It’s really a shock to the economy that w ill pass through.  And, you know, if you—if 
you look at where forecasters are— people who actually write down a forecast for a living—very, 
very strongly they see it that way.  
Now, we —but, you know , are—we ’re actually responsible for this, though, so we have to 
take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might 
actually move inflation expectations up, and that  we might —that the kind of things that might 
require a response.  We, again, we don’ t see that now.  But we , we have to be on the alert for it.  
And people have to understand and believe that we will react if , if we need to.  And we will.  
But, again, it ’s not —it’s not my base case.  My base case is that —is, as I ’ve said 
repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down.  And no, w e’re not —we , we have not at all 
changed our view, and I haven’ t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent , 
moderately above 2 percent , is a desirable thing.  This is not moderately above 2 percent .  This is 
well above 2  percent .  But it ’s also not the kind of inflation we were looking for.  This  is really 
driven by a supply- side shock. 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 29  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Don Lee at  the Los Angeles Times for the 
last question.  
DON LEE.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wonder if you could talk about wages.  Many workers 
seem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months.  What ca n workers generally 
expect going forward?  And it doesn ’t sound like you’ re concerned about rising wages feeding 
into broader inflation .  Is that right?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So wages have moved up.  A lot of that is driven by new hires.  And 
it’s—a lot of it is driven at relatively low -paid jobs in the service industries as people come back.  
So that ’s not troubling.  And we , we don’t see— there , there  is a form of wage inflation that can 
lead to price inflation, and we ’re not seeing that r ight now. 
And that really is if what we call “ unit labor costs ” move up and, and, and, which really 
puts—move up in a way that is —that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a 
situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices.  Now, when it 
happens gradually, when that —if you —we ’ve seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor 
costs do move up and, and  put some pressure on margins .  In a long expansion, that ’s been 
happening late in the expansion.  That ’s not a problem, either. 
The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices.  It was 
called the “ wage –price spiral. ”  We don’ t see that now.  This is something that was a featur e of 
the high inflationary era of the G reat Inflation, but it ’s not a feature now.  And w e don ’t see that 
now.  Of course, we ’ll be watching it.  
And this is one of the reasons why we ’re watching so carefully to see whether labor 
force —whether people do com e back and accept jobs.  Given the very large number of job 
openings and the  very large number of unemployed people, we ’d like to see, you know, those —
July 28, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 29  
 some matching going on there so people get back to work.  We think labor supply would be —
would be a healt hy thing.  You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with 
inflation and productivity, is a—is a good thing.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  And thank you all.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
September  22, 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon.  At the Federal  Reserve, we are strongly committed  
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates near zero  and maintained  
our current pace of asset purchases.  These measures, along w ith our strong guidance on interest 
rates and on our balance sheet, will ensure that monetary policy will continue to support the economy until the recovery is complete.  
Progress on vaccinations  and unprecedented fiscal policy actions are also providing 
strong support to the recovery.  I ndicators of economic activity and employment have continued 
to strengthen.  Real GDP rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth 
is widely expected to continue at a strong pace in the second half.  The sectors most adversely 
affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the rise in COVID -19 cases has 
slowed their recovery.  Household spending rose at an especially rapid pace over the first half of 
the year but flattened out in J uly and August as spending softened in COVID -sensitive sectors, 
such as travel and restaurants.   
Additionally, in some industries, near -term supply constraints are restraining activity.  
These constraints are particularly acute in the motor vehicle indust ry, where the worldwide 
shortage of semiconductors has sharply curtailed production.  Partly reflecting the effects of the virus and supply constraints, f orecasts from FOMC participants for economic growth this year 
have been revised somewhat lower s ince o ur June Summary of Economic Projections , but 
participants still foresee rapid growth.  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 27  
 As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have  continued to 
improve.  Demand for labor is very strong, and job gains averaged 750,000 per month over the 
past three months.  In August, however, job gains slowed markedly, with the slowdown concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality.  The unemployment rate was 5.2 percent in August, and this figure underst ates the shortfall in 
employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year.   
Factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing fears of the virus, 
appear to be weighing on employment growth.  These factors should diminish with progress on containing the virus, leading to more rapid gains in employment.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, with the median projection for the unemployment rate standing at 4.8 percent at the end of this year and 3.5 percent in 2023 
and ’ 24. 
The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to 
shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  In particular, despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on lower- wage workers in the service sector  and on African Americans 
and Hispanics.  
Inflation is elevated and will likely remain so in coming months before moderating.  As 
the economy continues to reopen and spending rebounds, we are seeing upward pressure on prices, particularly because supply bot tlenecks in some sectors have limited how quickly 
production can respond in the  near term.  These bottleneck effects have been larger and longer  
lasting than anticipated, leading to upward revisions to participants ’ inflation projections for this 
year.  Wh ile these supply effects are prominent for now, they will abate, and as they do, inflation 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 27  
 is expected to drop back toward our longer -run goal .  The median inflation projection from 
FOMC participants falls from 4.2 percent this year to 2.2 percent next yea r.   
The process of reopening the economy is unprecedented, as was the shutdown at the 
onset of the pandemic.  As the reopening continues, bottlenecks, hiring difficulties, and other 
constraints could again prove to be greater and longer  lasting than antic ipated, posing upside 
risks to inflation .  Our framework for monetary policy emphasizes the importance of having 
well-anchored inflation expectations, both to foster price stability and to enhance our ability to 
promote our broad- based and inclusive maximu m-employment goal.  Indicators of longer -term 
inflation expectations appear broadly consistent with our longer -run inflation goal of 2 percent.  
If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.
 
The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus , and risks to the 
economic outlook remain.  The Delta variant has led to significant increases in COVID -19 cases, 
resulting in significant hardship and loss and slowing the economic recovery.  C ontinued 
progress on vaccinations would help contain the virus and support a return to more normal 
economic conditions . 
The Fed ’s policy actions have been guided by our manda te to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.  They helped preserve financial stability and mark et functioning early in the pandemic and since then 
have helped foster accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. 
At our meeting that concluded earlier today, the Committee continued to discuss the 
progress made toward our goals since the C ommittee adopted its asset purchase guidance last 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 27  
 December.  Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals .  If progress 
continues broadly as expected, the Committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset 
purchases may soon be warrant ed.   
We also discussed the appropriate pace of tapering asset purchases once economic 
conditions satisfy the criterion laid out in the Committee ’s guidance.  While no decisions were 
made, participants generally view that, so long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate.  Even after our balance sheet stops  expanding, our elevated holdings of longer -term securities will 
continue to support accommodative financial conditions.  
The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to 
carry a direct signal regarding the timing of in terest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a 
different and substantially more stringent test.   We continue  to expect that it will be appropriate 
to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market 
condi tions have reached levels consistent with the Committee ’s assessment of maximum 
employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent 
for some time.  Half of FOMC participants forecast that these favorable economic conditions will be fulfilled  by the end of next year ; as a result, the median projection for the appropriate 
level of the federal funds rate lies slightly above the effective lower bound in 2022.   
Participants generally expect a gradual pace of policy fir ming that would leave the level 
of the federal funds rate below estimates of its longer -run level through 2024.  Of course, these 
projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a yea r or more from now.  More important than any forecast is the 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 27  
 fact that policy will remain accommodative  until we have achieved our maximum -employment 
and price -stability goals.  
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.  Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHEL LE SMITH.  Thank you.  W e’ll go first to Rachel Siegel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.   Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our 
questions.  When it comes to the taper and , eventually, to any rate increases, I ’m wondering if 
you can walk us through what “ substantial further progress ” looks like , given the latest batch of 
projections  that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the 
unemployment rate also being higher than June, as w ell as the change to GDP lower than June.  
If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what “ substantial further 
progress ” looks like, that would be great.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So the test for beginning our taper  is that we ’ve achieved 
substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment.  
And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress—substantial further progress.  So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others.  So the question is really on the maximum -employment test.  So if you look at a good number of 
indicators, you will see that, since last December , when we articulated the test , and the readings 
today, in many cases mo re than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment 
rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the  natural rate —50 or 60 percent of that road 
has been traveled.  So that could be substantial further progress.    
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 27  
 Many on the Committee feel that the “ substantial further progress ” test for employment 
has been met.  Others feel that it’ s close, but they want to see a little more progress.  There ’s a 
range of perspectives.  I guess my own view would be that the test —the “substantial further 
progress ” test for employment is all but met.  And so, once we ’ve met those two tests, once the 
Committee decides that they ’ve met  [them]—and that could come as soon as the next meeting ; 
that’s the purpose of that language , is to put notice out that  that could come as soon as the next 
meeting.  The Committee will consider that test, and we ’ll also look at the broader environment 
at that time and make a decision whether to taper.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Howard Schneider.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Thanks, Michelle.  So , looking at the 
SEPs , we got now basically four years of inflation above target , and policy never gets to the 
long- run rate.  I ’m wondering if you could address that from two perspectives :  one, within the 
new framework that the Fed adopted last year  and, second, from the perspective of the average 
household that ’s now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four 
years running when, for some this year, real wages h ave actually gone down.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So , as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit 
in the outyears.  And that ’s really , I think, a reflection of—and they’ve  moved up significantly 
for this year.  And that ’s, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that 
are being—that  we’re seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way 
yet.  So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into 
next year.  So that suggests that inflation ’s going to be higher this year , and a number —I guess 
the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths.  Why—th ose are very modest overshoot s.  You ’re looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 27  
 and three years out.  These are very, very —I don ’t think that households are going to, you know, 
notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot.  That just happens to be peopl e’s forecasts.   
You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation 
averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we ’re very much on track to achieve those things.  In 
terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework.   We want inflation 
expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent.  We want, we’ re—that’s really the ultimate test 
of whether we ’re getting this done under the framework.  And, you know, we do want inflation 
to run moderately above 2 percen t.  I wouldn’ t put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent 
in 2023 and ’24—one -tenth  in ’24.  But you’ re right, those are the numbers.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Colby Smith.  
COLBY SMITH.  Chair Powell—thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, you mentioned 
ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I ’m wondering what the contours of that 
debate have been.  For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining 
optionality for a 2022 interest rate increa se?  Or is it about financial stability risks?   Or concerns 
about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that there ’s very broad support on the Committee for 
this plan, both as t o the timing and as to the pace of the taper.  So this was a unanimous vote 
today, and I ’d say quite broad support for this approach.  You ’re correct that there  are some who 
would prefer to have gone sooner, and they’ ve made their arguments publicly.   For some of 
them , it’s a financial stability concern.  And for others , it’s other concerns.  They can make their 
own arguments.  This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us 
having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate.   
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 27  
 You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the —in the 
early stages of the crisis .  They were essential in restoring market function in the T reasury and 
other markets.  Then , as th e recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will 
do.  And now we ’re in a situation where they still have a use, but it ’s time for us to begin to taper 
them.   Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning.   
And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really 
where the framework —the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that so rt 
of thing.  So we think this is the appropriate way to go.  And, again, broad support on the 
Committee.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Nick Timiraos.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Hi, Nick Timiraos  of the  Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, you 
have said t he test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering.  But if the near- term 
projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff , and not just 
a taper , may be closer at hand.   Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about 
the threshold for liftoff that you ’ve articulated?   Or do they believe that either inflation or 
economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the 
test for beginning the taper.  And the taper takes some months in everyone ’s figuring.  So you’ re 
going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper.  So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it ’s what we adopted last September.  It ’s labor market conditions 
consistent with maximum employment.  And while we have interesting signs that , in many ways , 
the labor market’ s very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that 
those imbalances will sort themself out.  Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 27  
 moderately higher inflation over 2 percent —you know, that really depends on the path of 
inflation.  If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met 
that test by the time we reach liftoff.   
So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year -end 2022 numbers, 
some people are writing down very low unemployment rates .  And that ’s only one indicator , but 
it suggests a very strong labor market.  And I think they’ re writing down in good faith what they 
see as meeting the test.   There ’s a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but —
by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023.  So it ’s not really an 
unusually wide array of views about this.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  We’ ll go to Jeanna Sm ialek.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chair Powell —thank you for taking our questions.  Prior to 
recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents 
Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year?   And I wonder if you thought those were 
appropriate .  
CHAIR POWELL.   So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were do ing.  So 
let me just say a couple things about this subject.  We understand very well that the trust of the 
American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission.  And that ’s why I 
directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial 
holdings and activity by Fed  officials.   So those rules are , in many respects, the same as those for 
government agencies , plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our 
business.   
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 27  
 One of thos e is—sort of , three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures.  
One is , ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that ’s bank securities and other things.  
Secondly, there are times when we ’re not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell 
financial assets.  And that ’s the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting.  And, 
third, there ’s regular disclosure.  So all of these —everyone ’s, you know, ownership and 
activities ar e all disclosed on an annual basis.   
So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people ’s financial disclosures to 
know what their activities have been.  This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess 
you’d say it ’s served us well.  The o ther thing you would say—that it is now clearly seen as not 
adequate to the task of really sustaining the public ’s trust in us.  We need to make changes, and 
we’re going to do that as a consequence of this.  This will be a thoroughgoing and 
comprehensive r eview.  We’ re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten 
our rules and standards.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Great.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Steve Liesm an.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to follow up on 
Jeanna’s question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades .  Do you think it ’s 
appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying?   Is that one of the modifications that you ’re looking at?  And in that these —you said 
yourself, they’ re clearly not seen as appropriate.   In that the Fed ’s code of conduct says Fed  
officials should avoid even the appearance of the , of conflict, do those tr ades, in fact —and 
holdings —violate the Fed ’s code of conduct?  Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you 
might get— be done with your review?  Thank you, sir.  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Don ’t have a timeline yet ; we can start with that.  So, well, let me 
address the muni question, since that ’s in there.  You know, I personally owned municipal 
securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that.  Meaning I —they’re no— I’m holding 
all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity.  And munis were always thought  to be a pretty 
safe place for a Fed  person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed  would never 
buy municipal securities.  So it was not an uncommon thing.   
And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, a nd I did 
it without hesitating.  And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal 
financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse.  And it was time to go, and we did.  But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics  and—who looked carefully at it and 
said that I didn ’t have a conflict.  So that ’s one answer that I wanted to share with you.   
Secondly, you’ re right, though, as —we ’re going to be looking at all those things.  I don ’t 
want to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes.  But this, again, 
comprehensive and deliberate process—we ’re going to make changes.  I want to be able to look 
back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this c hallenge and handled the 
situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public ’s interest and 
the institution that we ’re all a part of.  
STEVE LIESMAN.   I’m sorry, Chair Powell —I just want to follow  up.  You said I was 
right.  When you said “ right ,” about that the Feds should not own—Federal Reserve officials 
should not own the same assets they ’re buying?  Is that — 
CHAIR POWELL.  I think that’ s a reasonable thing.  Yeah, and, of course, for the most 
part, we don ’t.  I mean, it wa s a real coincidence;  I happened to pre-own these munis.  They were 
bought many years ago, actually.  And so we started buying munis as part of the M unicipal 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 27  
 Liquidity F acility.  So it was really not a—it just was an unforeseen event.  And I couldn’ t sell 
them, so what I did was , I just held them, checked with the ethics people , and went ahead.  So, 
but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  We’ ll go to Chris Rugaber.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Thank you.  T hank you, Chair Powell.  Wider  question 
about jobs and the Fed ’s schedule —the Fed ’s policy framework that you laid out here.  You and 
other Fed  officials have often talked ab out expecting a job market pickup in September as more 
children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating.  You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring.  There ’s some real -time data suggesting that 
we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply.  So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports?   And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect 
your plans?   Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , you’ re right, we have a —really , I’ll call it a unique situation 
where , by many measures , the labor market is tight.  And 11 million job openings, very 
widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it ’s quite difficult to hire people, 
wages moving up, and that  kind—s o, quite a tight labor market.  So our view, I think —
widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including th e expiration of unemployment —extra unemployment benefits, and other things 
would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we ’d get out of this strange 
world where there ’re lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor 
shortage.   
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 27  
 And so what happened was , Delta happened.  And you had this very sharp spike in Delta 
cases.  And I think, so that affects—for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time 
or when they’ re always at a threat of being closed because o f Delta, the Delta variant, you know, 
you might want to wait .  Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have 
to quit it three weeks later, you’ re going to wait until you ’re confident of that.  So some of that 
may not have happened.  Also , people didn’ t, you know —as you know, hiring and spending in 
these face -to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those 
months.  So we —so that —really , the big shortfall in labor, in jobs , was largely in travel a nd 
leisure , and that’s because of —clearly because of Delta.  So that all happened.  And so what 
we—we know thi ngs that didn’ t happen. 
I think there ’s still —it may just be that it’ s going to take more time.  But it still seems 
that, inexorably, people will —these are people who were largely working back in February of 
2020.  They ’ll get back to work when it ’s time to do that.  It just may take a longer time.  You ’re 
right, though—it didn ’t happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was  Delta.   
In terms of the —you asked also about the test for November.  I think if the economy 
continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think—and also the overall 
situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting .  Or 
not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met.  
CHRIS RUGABER.   Well, just a  quick —if I could just quickly follow  up, I mean, what, 
how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for Septembe r?  And, I mean, is 
it, you know, are you in a data -dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers 
going ahead?  Or are we at a point where you ’ve accumulated enough progress that —  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So it is, it’ s accumulated progress.  So, you know, for me, it wouldn’ t 
take a knockout, great, super strong employment report.  It would take a reasonably good 
employment report for me to feel like that test is met.  And others on the Committee —many on 
the Committee feel that the test is already met.  Others want to see more progress.  And, you 
know, we ’ll work it out as we go.  But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but 
met.  So I don’ t personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I ’d like to see a 
good—a decent employment report.  I mean, it ’s not, it ’s, again, it ’s not to be confused with the 
test for liftoff, which is so much higher.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Great.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Thank you.  W e’ll go to Victoria Guida.   
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Chair Powell.  So I wanted to ask about the V ice C hair of 
Supervision position and just —I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role 
and the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy.  And then, just sort of a 
related question:   As you know, Randy Quarles’ s vice c hairmanship ends next month, a nd I was 
wondering if he ’s going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he ’s replaced in that role .  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So  Dodd- Frank created this position, V ice C hair for 
Supervision, and it ’s, there ’s actually a specific assignment in the Dodd -Frank language, as I ’m 
sure you know.  And, e ffectively , what it means is that the V ice C hair for S upervision is charged 
with settin g the regulatory agenda.  And, you know, it ’s a specific grant of authority.  And in the 
10 years, almost , that I’ ve been at the Fed , that person has really done that.  Dan Tarullo 
certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well.   And I would, I think —I respect that 
authority.  I respect that that’ s the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I 
would accept that.   
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 27  
 And, furthermore, you know, it ’s fully appropriate to look at —for a new person to come 
in and look at the current s tate of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, 
and I welcome that.  In terms of Vice Chair Quarles ’s term, we ’re not currently in that situation, 
and I actually don’ t have any updates for you on that today.  We’ll keep you posted on that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Thank you.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive 
monetary policy framework.  In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that 
they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but  the B lack 
unemployment rate is 6.1 percent.  And I ’m wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for 
African  Americans is consistent with full employment o r whether it would need to be lower as 
part of your inclusive growth strategy .  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a 
particular unemployment rate for any particular group.  Really , we look at a broad range of —a 
very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is.  And one of 
the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing.  So we will do all of that.  So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking?  So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market.   If 
you look at the last two or three years of , before the pandemic hit, you saw —after a lot of long 
progress, you saw a really strong labor market.  And you saw wages at the low end moving up 
faster than everywhere else—s omething that ’s great to see.   
We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for 
African  Americans, for example, and also participation rates.  We saw a really, really healthy set 
of dynamics.  And, by the way, we also—there was no reason why it couldn’ t continue.  There 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 27  
 were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic.  We were not —there 
was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a 
recession.  So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few  more 
years of this.  It would have been—so we ’re all quite eager to get back to that.   
We also said we wouldn ’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment , in the 
absence of inflation.  So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that tha t really benefited  
labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way.  That ’s, of course, not the current 
situation.  We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not 
moderately above target.  So that ’s, really , how we thi nk about it.  It isn ’t really just targeting the 
headline numbers, but it ’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about 
what constitutes maximum employment.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.   Just to follow  up, s hould there be a significant gap bet ween 
Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the 
control of the Fed  that other people should be doing something about?  Or should that be —
should the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you really —I mean, first of all, ideally , there wouldn’ t be any 
gap, of course.  We would all love to see no such gap.  This is a persistent gap, and it ’s very hard 
to explain based on typical metrics.   It’s just, it ’s quite troubling, but it really is —you know, we 
have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools.  I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies —frankly, education policies and t hat kind of thing— are better at focusing on.  
I think we ’ve identified the part that we can do, and we ’ll do that part.  But I ’ve always been 
clear that it’ s going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems.  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 27  
 STEVE MATTHEWS.  Thanks.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   —a plan  for  dealing with a debt default that included 
prioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted—or , 
nondefaulted T reasuries and buying those who are —that are.  Are any or all of those still on the 
table?  Do you think any of those would work?  And what would happen to the economy, in your 
view, should the debt ceiling not be raised?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question.  So 
it’s just very important that the debt ceiling be rais ed in a timely fashion so that the United States 
can pay its bills when and as they come due.  That ’s a critically important thing.  The failure to 
do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to 
the financia l markets.  And it ’s just not something that we could contemplate, that we should 
contemplate.  I ’m not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that.  I’m just going to 
say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn ’t defaul t on any of its 
obligations —should pay them when and as due.  And that, you know, no one should assume that 
the F ed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure —fully 
protect in the event of a failure  to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when 
they’ re due.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Good.  If I could follow  up, have you discussed options with 
members of Congress?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don’ t generally ever talk about the conversations I have 
with elected offic ials or other appointed officials.  But, look, you can see that this is a major 
focus among those who have responsibility for it, and—including elected people.  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 27  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Hannah Lang.  
HANNAH LANG.  Hi—thanks so much.  Senato r Warren sent you a letter last week 
urging the F ed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called “ ungovernable behavior ” from the 
bank.  I ’m just curious, under what circumstances would the F ed actually consider revoking a 
financial holding company’ s license?  And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, 
warrant such an action?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo’ s efforts to 
fix its widespread and pervasive problems.  They represent a serious matter to u s, and the firm is 
required to remediate them.  And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to 
meet our expectation.  We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an 
unprecedented asset cap that will stay in plac e until the firm has comprehensively fixed its 
problems.  And we ’re not going to remove that asset cap until that ’s done.  So bottom line is, 
we’ll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or 
violating laws.  But I can ’t speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any 
individual  bank.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Now we ’ll go to Michael Derby.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  You noted earlier in the press 
conference that you weren ’t aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas F ed Bank 
presidents.  As you know , those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the 
renomination process earlier this year.  And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process 
at the time.  So I want to know, did anybody know —did anybody at the Board level know about 
the stock trading activity?  And , going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and 
Boston F ed Bank presidents to do their job?  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So these,  I don’ t need to tell you, we file, people file these reports 
annually.  And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020.  So I don’ t have any reason to 
think people at the B oard would have known about particular trading that ’s going on.  They wil l 
see that —there are people at the F ed who see th e, you know, see the trading reports when 
they’ re, you know, when they’ re annually filed.   
You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, 
no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised.  It’ s 
something we take very, very seriously.  This is an important moment for the F ed, and I ’m 
determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time.  
I’m very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things.  And, 
you know, when we have things to announce, we ’ll go ahead and do that, but that ’s really what I 
have for today.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  One small follow -up.  I mean, I know that you didn ’t have the 
2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past -year forms in hand.  And at least in the case of, 
like, the Dallas disclosu re forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past.   So that , in 
theory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that ’s, yeah, that ’s a good question.  So, you know, the five -year 
review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the F OMC, all of those  things.  
And if there were a concern —a public concern or a private concern —about something that 
someone had done, we wouldn’ t wait for the five -year.  We wouldn’ t wait that day if there were 
concerns.   
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 27  
 You’re right, though, these —as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, 
and it ’s similar to what other government agencies have, only it ’s a little stricter.  And it is that 
you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt.  You can’ t trade during 
the FOMC period and du ring the meeting —the blackout period and then during the meeting.  
And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years.  So all of these things have 
been going —to the extent they ’ve been going on, they’ ve been a matter of public record.   
And, you know —but, nonetheless —so that —you know, it was seeming to work just 
okay.  And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, “We need to do better .”  And we 
will.  But you’ re right, but it has not been part of the process.   And, appropriately, I don’ t think it 
should have been.  I mean, I wouldn’ t blame the people who conduct that review.  I really think, 
if someone had raised concerns or if we ’d had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn ’t 
have  been part of that process.   It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five 
years.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Jean Yung.  
JEAN YUNG.  Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how  the F ed 
would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal .  Would you hold off on raising rates?  
Or how would you think about that?   Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.   Well, let me say one thing .  You’re looking for conditions consistent 
with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time.  So you’ re not 
necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time.  But more to your point , really, we actually 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 27  
 have a paragraph in our framework, and something like thi s has been there for a long time.  It’s, I 
think it ’s paragraph six.  And you’ re talking about a situation in which the two goals are not 
complementary ; they’ re somehow in tension.  And if we judge that ’s effect —that is the case, 
what it says is , we take i nto account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the 
potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return 
to levels judged consistent with the mandate.   
So, we used to call that the balanced -approach paragraph because it had those words.  So 
it’s a very difficult situation for any central bank to be —pardon me —to be in a situation where 
the two goals are in tension.  And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equit ies between the two.  How long will it take , and how big are the gaps , and that 
kind of thing.  We don’ t really think we ’re in that —we ’re sort of in that situation, I’ d say, in a 
short -term way.  But we think, we do expect that this is sort of —because of the COVID shock 
and the reopening and all that , you’ re seeing this temporarily.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Great.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking 
the question.  So on c orporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we ’ve been watching, 
could that be —is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that ’s 
out there?   In the past you’ve  said you’ re watching the level of corporate debt.  So is, what ’s 
your level of concern right now?  And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal?  
CHAIR POWELL.   About the United States, no.  Corporate defaults are very low in the 
United States right now.  Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that 
ended with the pandemic.  We were very concerned in the last year or so.   We were concerned in 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 27  
 the last year or so, and then I ’d say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if 
you’ve got a highly lever aged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things 
happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of 
defaults.  It didn’ t happen, potentially —I mean, to a significant extent because of the C ARES  
Act and the response that we undertook and all that.  It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we ’ve ever had.  And I think for whatever reason now , you have very, very low 
default rates now among corporate debt.   
You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high 
debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had.  And  the government has been working to get that under control.  This is part of that effort.  
The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies.  And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it ’s something the y’re managing.  In  terms of the implications 
for us, there isn ’t, there ’s not a lot of direct United States exposure.   The big Chinese banks are 
not tremendously exposed.  But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence cha nnels and that kind of thing.  But I wouldn’ t draw a parallel to 
the United States corporate sector.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Brian Cheung.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.   Just wondering if you could give us an update 
on whether or not you’ ve had conversations with the White House about a possible 
reappointment .  And then whether or not you would like to be reappointed as this chatter kind of 
builds up.  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think the phrase goes : “I have nothing for you on that today.”  
Sorry.  I’m focused on doing my job — 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 27  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Greg Robb. 
CHAIR POWELL.  —I ’m focused on doing my job every day for the American people, 
and I don’ t have any comment on that, Brian.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Sorry about that.  Let’s go to Greg Robb.  
GREG ROBB.  Thanks.  Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell.  I was wondering 
if, in your discussion about the tapering that —you said that officials think it’ s appropriate to end 
around the middle of the year —if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance 
sheet then .  I’ve heard some F ed officials say that they wouldn ’t shrink the balance sheet.  Was 
that discussed?  And what ’s your stance on shr inking the balance sheet?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So my thinking on this has been:  L et’s get through the taper 
decision, and then let ’s turn to those issues.  There are a number of related issues that —you 
mentioned one, Greg, but , you know, and—which you need to start to think about, and we ’ll do 
that.  But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues , 
rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues , because we’ re really not.  
And, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time.  We ’ve watched other 
countries and what they’ ve done.  So I think we ’ll be able to get to sensible decisions fai rly 
expeditiously when it ’s time .  But it’ s just not time yet, in my thinking.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Scott Horsley.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You talked a little bit about inflation 
expectations.  And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists —which are pretty much in line with the FOMC 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 27  
 members —and laypeople ’s expectations, at  least as reflected in the recent New York F ed survey.  
How much weight do you put on laypeople ’s expectations?  And what do you think accounts for 
that divide?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So within —let ’s just take the household surveys generally.  The New 
York F ed su rvey, let me talk about that specifically , and this is from the New York F ed.  It’ s 
only an eight -year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they’ re looking three years out.  
And it seems like there’ s a high correlation between three -year and one -year.  For the most part, 
surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near  term but not in the lo nger 
term.  And that ’s also what expectations are showing.   
So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course.  And that ’s why we have 
this thing called the CIE, which is the, it’ s an index of —it’s market -based measures, i t’s 
professional forecasters , and it ’s household surveys.  And you just put them all —it’s not, you 
know, it doesn’ t have a lot of grand theory about it.  You put them all in, and you measure the 
change.  So you should be —and, also , you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of 
thing, so you can look at all that.  And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving 
up.  Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say , 2013, which was before the really— the drop in inflation expectations 
broadly happened in ’ 14 and ’ 15—around then.  So that’s not a troubling thing.   
But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important.  We spend a lot of time 
watching them.   And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently 
above levels that are really consistent with o ur mandate, then, you know, we would certainly 
react to that.  But we don’ t really see that now.   We see more of a moderate increase that is—the 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 27  
 first part of which is welcome.  And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, 
and it was good to see them get back up a bit.  But, again, we watch carefully.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Let ’s go to Heather Scott.  
HEATHER SCOTT.  Hi.  Sorry, you caught me off guard.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for 
taking my question.  I really appreciate it.  Aga in, on the taper timing.  You say it ’s going to last 
to the middle of next year.  But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks  to 
inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering?  
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s not my expectation.  Of course, we can always—we haven ’t 
decided to taper yet, and we haven’ t decided the  pace yet.  So, you know, i t’s not my expectation 
that we would have to.  We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we —if it becomes 
appropriate , though.  A bsolutely.  In fact, back in ’ 13, when we tapered, we always said we 
weren ’t on a preset course.  I think this will b e a shorter period.   The economy’ s much farther 
along than it was when we tapered in 2013.  So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen.  It ’s 
a very gradual taper.   It will be when we agree on it.  And, but we certainly have the freedom to 
either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate.  
HEATHER SCOTT.  But you wouldn’ t expect rate liftoff to happen until you ’re finished 
with that process?  
CHAIR POWELL.   You  wouldn’ t, no, because, you know, when you’ re—as long as 
you’re buying assets, you ’re adding accommodation, and it wouldn’ t make any sense to, you 
know, then lift  off.  I mean, what you would do is , you’ d speed up the taper, I think, if that were 
the situation you’ re in.  Not—we don’ t expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be 
wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction.  
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 27  
 HEATHER SCOTT.   All right, thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMI TH.  Okay, for the last question,  we’ll go to Jeff Cox.  
JEFF COX.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question.  I just wanted to check in 
with you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the F ed to develop a central bank 
digital currency .  I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications 
that it’ s going to come this month.  But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see 
where the F ed’s heading on this , and just wondering if you can provide some update there .  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure, I ’d be glad to.  So we think it ’s really important that the c entral 
bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public ’s benefit.  That ’s one of our 
jobs.  We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the F ed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy 
currency and payment system.  So there ’s extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking 
place outside the regul atory perimeter.   And innovation is fantastic.  Our economy runs on 
innovation.  But where the public ’s money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate 
regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases.   
So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency -like 
products, we ’re workin g proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC  and, if so, in what 
form.  We have two broad workstreams , one of which is really technology, both at the B oard and 
in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ’s work with MIT —the other of which is to identify, 
scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues.  As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement —
engagement with many different groups, including elected officials , around these issues.  We 
September 22, 2021 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 27  
 think it ’s our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for 
making an informed decision.   
The ultimate test we’ll  apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other 
digital innovat ions is :  Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?  
We’re also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for 
instant payments in the U.S.   It’ll be the first such major expansion of our co re payment system 
since the 1970s.  We found the case for  this quite compelling —for consumers, businesses , and 
just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system.   So, bottom line, 
we haven ’t made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in 
order to form the basis of this public interaction that we ’ll have.  Thank you very much.   
JEFF COX.  If I could have a quick —could I get a quick follow on that?  Thank you.  I 
was just wondering if —okay—are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global 
race for digital currenc ies?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think it ’s important that we get to a place where we can make an 
informed decision about this and do so expeditiously.  I don’ t think we ’re be hind.  I think it ’s 
more important to do this right than to do it fast.  We are the world ’s reserve currency.  And I 
think we ’re in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision —by the way, which 
will be a governmentwide decision.  We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the 
minds with the A dministration and also probably with Congress.  We would really like to have 
broad support for this.  It’ s a very important innovation.  And I think we would need that to go 
ahead, and that ’s the process we’ re engaged in.  Thanks very much.  
MICHELLE  SMITH.  Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s  Press Conference 
November  3, 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today, the FOMC  kept interest rates near zero and, in light of the progress the economy 
has made toward our goals, decided to begin reducing the pace of asset purchases.  With these actions, monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery.  Given the unprecedented nature of the disruptions related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, we remain attentive to risks and will ensure that our policy is well positioned to address the ful l range of plausible economic outcomes.  I will say more about our monetary 
policy decisions after reviewing recent economic developments.  
Economic activity expanded at a 6.5 percent pace in the first half of the year, reflecting 
progress on vaccinations, the reopening of the economy, and strong policy support.  In the third 
quarter, real GDP growth slowed notably from this rapid pace.  The summer’s surge in COVID cases from the Delta variant has held back the recovery in the sectors most adversely affected  by 
the pandemic, including travel and leisure.  Activity has also been restrained by supply constraints and bottlenecks, notably in the motor vehicle industry.  As a result, both household spending and business investment flattened out last quarter.  None theless, aggregate demand has 
been very strong this year, buoyed by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.  With COVID case counts receding further  and 
progress on vaccinations, economic growth should pick up this quarter, resulting in strong 
growth for the year as a whole.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 29  
 Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve , and demand for workers 
remains very strong.  As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement slowed with 
the rise in COVID cases.  In August and September, job gains averaged 280,000 per month, down from an average of about 1 million jobs per month in June and July.  The slowdown has been concentrated in sectors most sensitive to the pandemic, including leisu re and hospitality and 
education.   
The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in September .  This figure understates the 
shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market remains subdued.  Some of the softness in participation likely r eflects the aging of the population and retirements.  But 
participation for prime -aged individuals also remains well below pre -pandemic levels —in part 
reflecting factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus .  As a result, employers are having difficulties filling job openings.  These impediments 
to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus —supporting gains 
in employment and economic activity. 
The economic downturn has not fal len equally on all Americans, and those least able to 
shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.  Despite progress, joblessness continues to fall disproportionately on African Americans and Hispanics.  
The supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemi c and the reopening of the 
economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.  In particular, bottlenecks and supply chain disruptions are limiting how quickly production can respond to the rebound in demand in the near term.  As a result , overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent 
longer -run goal.  Supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated.  
Nonetheless, it remains the case that the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 29  
 connected to t he dislocations caused by the pandemic —specifically , the effects on supply and 
demand from the shutdown, the uneven reopening, and the ongoing effects of the virus itself.  
We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and familie s, 
particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials such as food and 
transportation.  Our tools cannot ease supply constraints.  Like most forecasters, we continue to believe that our dynamic economy will adjust to the supply an d demand imbalances and that , as 
it does, inflation will decline to levels much closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal.  Of course, it 
is very difficult to predict the persistence of supply constraints or their effects on inflation.  Global supply chains are complex; they will return to normal function, but the timing of that is highly uncertain.  
We are committed to our longer -run goal of 2 percent inflation and to having longer -term 
inflation expectations well anchored at this goal.  If we were to see si gns that the path of 
inflation, or [of] longer -term inflation expectations, was moving materially and persistently 
beyond levels consistent with our goal, we would use our tools to preserve price stability.  We will be watching carefully to see whether the  economy is evolving in line with expectations.  
The Fed’s policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.  Our asset purchases have been a critical tool.  They helped preserve financial stability early in the pandemic and since then have helped foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions to support the economy. 
Last December, th e Committee stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace 
of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 29  
 maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  At today’s meeting, the Committee judged th at 
the economy has met this test, and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases.  
Beginning later this month, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases by 
$10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortga ge-backed securities.  We 
also announced another reduction of this size in the monthly purchase pace starting in mid-
December, since that month’s purchase schedule will be released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prior to our December FOMC meeting.   If the economy evolves broadly as expected, 
we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year.  That said, we are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  And e ven after our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities 
will continue to support accommodative financial conditions.  
Our decision today to begin tapering our asset purchases does not imply any direct signal 
regarding our interest rate policy .  We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test 
for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal  funds rate.   
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price -stability goal.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.   
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Hi.  Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, the 
markets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year.  Are they wrong?  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say it this way.  We try to focus on what we can 
control —and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world, 
how we ’re thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will 
evolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent , where the economy evolves in 
unexpected ways.  So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising 
rates.   
It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further 
progress toward our goals, measured from last December.  We don’ t think it ’s time yet to raise 
interest rates.  There is still ground to cover to re ach maximum employment , both in terms of 
employment and in terms of participation.   
Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and 
shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that , as the 
pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate—and job growth will move back up.  
And as that happens, inflation will decline from today’ s elevated levels.  Of course, the timing of 
that is highly uncertain.  B ut, certainly , we should see inflation moving down by the second or 
third quarter.  The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on 
the path of the economy.   
We think we can be patient.  If a response is called for, we will not hesitate.   So, what I 
will tell you is , we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with 
our expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately. And that ’s what I would say.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.   Based on —if I could follow up, based on your c urrent outlook for 
the labor market, do you think it ’s possible—or likely , even —that maximum employment could 
be achieved by the second half of next year?  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So if you look at the progress that we ’ve made over the course of the 
last year, if t hat pace were to continue, then the answer would be :  “Y es, I do think that that is 
possible. ”  Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but 
it’s certainly within the real m of possibility.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Next , we’ll go to Jeanna  at the New York Times.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I was wondering if you could detail a little bit 
how you’ re thinking about wages at this moment.  Obviously, we ’re seeing strong wage growth, 
particularly for people in sort of lower- income fields.   I wonder if you see that as a positive thing 
or as a potential start to a wage –price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two 
things.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly.  A nd, in 
particular, I would point to the e mployment c ompensation i ndex reading that we got last Friday.  
Now, in real terms, they ’ve been —they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real 
wages were not really increasi ng.  I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not 
increasing , but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase.  So wages moving up, of 
course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation.  It’ s 
very important, and it ’s generally a good thing.  You know, the concern is  a somewhat unusual 
case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and 
productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure  on margins and 
cause companies to —or employers , really —to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, 
find yourself in what we used to call a wage –price spiral.  We don’ t have evidence of that yet.  
Productivity has been very high.  The ECI reading is just one reading.  Again, if you look back, 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 29  
 we—so we ’ll be watching this carefully .  But I would say that , at this point, we don’ t see 
troubling increases in wages .  And we don’ t expect those to emerge, but we’ ll be watching 
carefully.  
JOE PAVEL.  Next , we’ll go to Steve Liesman from CNBC.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wonder if you could perhaps give us 
your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.  You talked about the 
shortfall of unemployment —reemployment relative to befo re the pandemic, and yet you have 
inflation, which is affecting everybody.  Are we at , or close to , a point where the risk of inflation 
is greater than the benefit that you ’d—for recovering these lost jobs so that now , from a risk -
management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes?   And k ind of a 
related question:  T he statement today says you’ ll keep policy accommodative until you hit that 
2 percent  inflation target.  Our surveys show looking for 5 per cent inflation this year, 3 ½ percent  
next year —it sure seems like you ’re on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent  
target.  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So I ’m not sure I totally got your first question, but I would 
say—in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again?  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Sure.  The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and 
unemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find 
these 5 million jobs  again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher 
inflation —is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat 
inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s, so, you know, this isn ’t the traditional Phillips curve situation 
where there ’s a direct tradeoff, where  that’s really what we ’re talking about.  The inflation that 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 29  
 we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market.  It ’s due to bottlene cks, and it ’s due to 
shortages, and it ’s due to very strong demand meeting those.  So I think it ’s not the classical 
situation where you have that precise tradeoff.   
But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our S tatement o n Longer -Run 
Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is , we take into 
account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time 
horizons over  which employment and inflation are projected to retur n to levels judged consistent 
with the mandate.  So we used to call that the “ balanced approach ” paragraph .  We have to think 
about the amount of the deviation, w e have to think about the time it will take, and we have to 
make policy in a world where the t wo goals are in tension.  It’s very difficult.   
But what it really boils down to is something that ’s common sense .  And that is risk 
management.  We have to be aware of the risks that we’ re—particularly now the risk of 
significantly higher inflation.  We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well 
into next year.  We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to —should it create a threat of more persistent, longer- term 
inflation .  And that ’s what we think our policy is doing now.  It’ s putting us in a position to be 
able to address the range of plausible outcomes.  
JOE PAVEL.   Thank you.  Next, we ’ll go to Colby Smith at the Financial Times .  
COLBY SMITH.   Thank you.  Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that 
would perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering ?  And I’m wondering how you w ould also 
characterize the risks that the F ed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually.  
Thank you.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.   So I guess , as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy 
performs broadly as expected, the Committee  judges that similar reductions in the pace of net 
asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we ’re prepared to deviate from that 
path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.   
So I’m not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be.  Of course, if we do 
see something like that happening, if it b ecomes a question, then we ’ll communicate very 
transparently and openly about that.  But I ’m just going to leave it with the words that are in the 
statement.   Sorry, was there a second part?   
COLBY SMITH.  Ye s.  It’s just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have 
to do so later on.  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here.  We 
are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it ’s warranted 
by changes in the economic outlook.  And , again, if we feel like something like that ’s happening, 
then we ’ll be very transparent about it.  We wouldn’ t want to surprise markets.  We ’ll say, in 
light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either d o it 
or not do it.  But so —but I ’m not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that 
might be today.  Thanks.  
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you. 
JOE PAVEL.  Thank you.  Next one, Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post .  
RACHEL SIEGEL.   Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  
You mentioned at the beginning that the F ed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses 
for individuals and families, especially those with limited means.  What is your message to t hose 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 29  
 families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your 
expectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So, first of all, it is our job to —and we accept responsibility 
and accountability for inflation in the medium term.  We’ re accountable to Congress and to the 
American people for maximum employment and price stability.  The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability.   By the way, we ’re also not at maximum 
employment, as I mentioned.  So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control.   
We don’ t think it ’s a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the 
labor market heal further .  And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the 
Delta variant declines, s o—which it ’s doing now.  So “ transitory ” is a word that people have had 
different understandings of.  For some, it carries a sense of “short lived, ” and that ’s, you know, 
there ’s a real time component —measured in months, let ’s say.   Really , for us, what “ transitory ” 
has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation.  So that ’s why we, you know, we took a step back from “ transitory. ”   
We said “expected to be transitory ,” first of all, to show u ncertainty around that —we’ve 
always said that, by the way, in other context s; we just hadn ’t done it in the statement —but also 
to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people.  And then we added 
some language to really explain more what we ’re talking about in paragraph two and 
paragraph three.  We said that “supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the 
reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,”  and we said , “Progress on 
vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 29  
 economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. ”  So we ’re trying to 
explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about “transitory. ”   
So it’s, I mean , it’s become a word that ’s attracted a lot of attention that maybe is 
distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible.   Ultimately, the only 
other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it ’s particularly people who are 
living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs —when the 
winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes.  We understand completely what they’ re 
going through.  A nd, you know, we will use our  tools over time to make sure that that doesn ’t 
become a permanent feature of life.  R eally , that’s one of our principal jobs, along with 
achieving maximum employment .  And that ’s our commitment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Chris Rugaber of t he Associated Press.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Great.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Well, I 
wonder if you could update us .  You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could 
you update how you define that?   I mean , you’ ve, you know —a few months ago, yourself and 
other F ed officials talked about getting back to the pre -COVID labor market.  There w ere even 
hints you might try to do something better than that.  Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, 
people retiring, and there ’s talk of not being able to get back as—all the jobs back because of 
that and other trends.  You did mention the prime -age folks.  So can you give us some examples 
of things you're looking at , specifically , to measure full employment ?  Will you be looking at 
prime -age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to 
pre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that 
would work?   Thank you.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

 CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So maximum employment is, it ’s a broad —what would we 
say?—broad -based and inclusive goal that ’s not directly measurable and changes over time due 
to various factors.  You can’ t specify a specific goal.   So it ’s taking into account quite a broad 
range of things, and, of course, employment —levels of employment —[and]  participation are a 
part of that.  But , in addition, there are other measures of what ’s going on in the labor market, 
like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is —the level of quits , the amount of 
job openings , the flows in and out of various states.  So we look at so many different things, and 
you make an overall judgment.   
Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February 
of 2020 and say, well, that ’s the goal because we didn’ t know any—that ’s what we knew.   We 
knew that w as achievable in a context of low inflation.   I think we ’re in a, you know, we ’re 
learning that.   We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still 
very, you know, COVID -affected, by the way.  A lot of what we ’re seeing in the last 90 days is 
because of Delta.  We were on a path to a very different place.  Delta put us on a different path .  
And we see these things.   But, so I think we ’re going to have to—ideally , we would have, we 
would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn ’t another COVID 
spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot.  We would see whether —how does 
participation react in that world, in that sor t of post -COVID world ?   
Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and]  
because of fear of COVID to a significant extent.  You know, we thought that schools reopening 
and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply.  That doesn’ t seem to have been the case, interestingly.  So I think there ’s room for a whole lot of 
humility here , as we try to think about what maximum employment would be.  We’ re going to 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 29  
 have to see some time post -COVID so that we know —or post -Delta, anyway —to see what is 
possible.  And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that , over 
time, you can get to places that didn’ t look possible.   
Now, what we also have now , though, is , we hav e high inflation.  So we have a 
completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that 
with what ’s going on in the employment market.  So it’s a complicated situation, and I would 
say, we will, we hope to achieve signi ficantly greater clarity about where this economy is going 
and what the characteristics of the post -pandemic economy are over the first half of next  year.  
JOE PAVEL.  Thanks .  We’ll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, and thanks for doing this.  So, give n that answer 
about employment , I would like to get back to Steve ’s question a little bit.  On a headline basis, 
just as it ’s evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met?  
CHAIR P OWELL.  Sorry, the two tests?  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  The two tests in the state ment —the guidance that it has to hit 
2 percent  and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent .  Has the economy cleared that?  
CHAIR POWELL.   That ’s a decision for the Committee .  I would put it to you this way.  
When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee ’s judgment, it ’s very possible that the inflation test 
will already be met.  We’re aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with 
what ’s going on, but , you know, we ’re not at maximum employment.  When that is the case, 
we’ll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there ’s a good chance that it will be if you 
look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 29  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.   So, to follow up, so you’ re not willing to commit that the 
current levels of inflation and their persistence have met “moderately ” and “ for some time. ”  So, 
given that, I mean, how should we wonder what “moderately ” over and “ for some time ” mean?  
CHAIR POWELL.  What I ’m really saying is, that question is not before us right now.  
You know, we had the question on when to taper.  We’ ve now answered that question and the 
speed of i t and all that.  We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test , because we 
don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’ re not at maximum employment.   
What I ’m saying is, given where inflation is and where it ’s projected to be, let ’s say we 
do mee t the maximum- employment test .  Then the Committee —the question for the Committee  
at that time will be , has the inflation test been met ?  And, you know, I don’ t want to get ahead of 
the Committee  on that, but the answer may very well be “Y es, it ’s been met .”  But we ’re not 
asking that question today, because we’ re not running a liftoff test.  W e’re not evaluating the  
liftoff test today.  We didn ’t have that discussion at today’s meeting.  We did talk about the 
economy and the development of the economy, but we didn’ t ask ourselves whether the liftoff 
test is met, because, you know, it ’s clearly not met on the maximum -employment side.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi , Chair Powell.  M atthew Boesler with Bloomberg.  So, 
when you’ re looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at 
maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent 
of what inflation is doing?  And , if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of 
the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we ’re seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor  market ?  Thank you.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So we don’ t actually define maximum employment as —we define it 
in terms of inflation, but , of course, there is a connection there.  Maximum employment has to be 
a level that is consistent with stable prices.  But that ’s not really how we think about it.  We think 
about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things.  You can’ t just look at—
unlike inflation, where you can have a number .  But with maximum employment, you could be 
in a situation , hypothetically, w here the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people 
who are out of the labor force and will come back in.  And so you wouldn’ t really be at 
maximum employment , because there’ s this group that isn ’t counted as unemployed.  
So we look at a range of things.  So the thing is , by many measures , we are at a very tight 
labor market.   I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things .  Many of them are 
signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that?  B ecause you have people 
who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own—they’ re holding themselves out of 
the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID , or, for whatever 
reason, they ’re staying out.  And it ’s clear th at there are, you know —with tremendous demand 
for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we ’re set up to go back to a higher job-
creation  rate.  So that would suggest that you’ re not at maximum employment.   So, at the end of 
the day, it is a judgme nt thing.  But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of 
employment that ’s consistent with price stability.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.   And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you’ve  talked 
a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in  tension and how you would have 
to balance those two things .  Could you talk a little bit about what the F ed’s process for 
balancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year , you decide there ’s a 
serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls?  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  I mean, again, it ’s a risk -management thing.  It ’s not —I can ’t 
reduce it to an equation, but , ultimately, it’ s about risk management.  So you want to be in a 
position to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case.  And in this 
case, the risk is skewed .  For now , it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation.  So w e need 
to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be.  So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it.  And I think, though, that , judgmentally , 
too, it ’s appropriate to be patient.   It’s appropria te for us to see what the labor market and what 
the economy look like when they heal further.   
We know that we were on a path to a different place, a s I mentioned, when D elta arrived .  
And D elta stopped, it stopped job creation.  It stopped that transitio n away from a goods -focused 
economy where there ’s excess demand for goods because ther e—services are not available.  
People are not traveling.  That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because , 
presumably , people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel 
and all sorts of travel services and things like that.  
So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the 
economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.  Bottlenecks should be abating.  We start to see that now with some of them, but , overall, they haven ’t gotten 
better overall, and, you know, we ’re very aware of that.  So that ’s really how we ’re thinking 
about it.  We ’re thinking that time will tell us more.  In the meantime, we don’ t think it’ s time to 
raise rates now.  You know, if we do conclude that it ’s necessary to do so, then we ’ll be patient, 
but we won’ t hesitate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Let ’s go to Edwar d Lawrence at Fox Business.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 29  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call.  So the Federal 
Reserve—I want to talk about climate change .  The Federal Reserve released a statement 
today—says  “the Federal Reserve supports the efforts . . . to identify key issues and potential 
solutions for the climate -related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory”  
outcomes.  Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, 
like coal plants or fossil fu els?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So that ’s not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency.  That ’s 
a decision for elected representatives.   So we feel that any role that we have—and we do think 
we have a role in climate change.  It relates to our existing mandat es, and our existing mandates 
are, really , prudential regulation of financial institutions.  We expect them , and the public will 
expect us to expect them , to understand and be in a position to manage their risks.  So that ’s 
physical risk, and it ’s transition risk for climate .  And, by the way, the large financial institutions 
are doing this already, and, you know, we think that ’s right within our mandate.  
There ’s also a financial stability question , the overall stability of the financial system.  
And so, from that standpoint, we can do research.  We can try to help understand what will the 
pathways be through which climate change effects the economy—both physical risk and transition risk .  That ’s what we can do, and that ’s what we will do .  And we ’ll do it well.  W ithin 
the frame of our existing mandates , we’ll do it well.   We ’re not the people who will decide the 
national strategy on climate change.  That has to be elected people, and not so much us.  We feel 
like we have that narrow mandate, and we  will do it well.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Victoria Guida at Politico.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 29  
 VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Chair Powell.  So the F ed recently announced that there is 
going to be new conflict -of-interest rules for investments by F ed officials, and this follows, 
obviously, the resignation of two regional F ed presidents.  And I ’m just wondering, do you think 
that there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the F ed, such as, you 
know, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts?  And also, if you could speak to 
whether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by F ed officials.   Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we, you know, we —let me just say that this system, the ethics 
system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case.   And so we had no moment of denial about that.  As a 
group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took.  A nd, you know, wi thin one FOMC 
cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is , we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we’ re working in their 
interest all the time —absolutely critical to our w ork, as it is for any government agency.  A nd I 
feel like this called that into question.   So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and 
forcefully.  If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them.  
So you asked me about blind trusts.  You know, the overall authority for ethics around 
these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE .  And they have 
a long- held position which is not favorable to blind trusts.  They do not encourage them.  They 
don’t think they’ re effective.  They think they ’re cumbersome .  And they think there are better 
ways to get at the things that need to be done .  And those are the things that we ’re actually doing.  
So I don’ t know that there are any blind trusts , for that reason, because they are the, they ’re the 
regulator .  They say this on their website , if you look.  In terms of laws broken, you know, I 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 29  
 asked the inspector g eneral to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there 
were laws broken, and I won’ t speculate on that .  But that is with the i nspector g eneral now and, 
of course, out of my hands.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that , given 
the long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given 
inflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore , 
send the economy into recession.  Given the  fact that , basically , your forecast has been chasing 
inflation over the last year, and now you’ re talking about it not coming down until the second or 
third quarter , why would they be wrong in thinking that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so, let me say what ’s hap pened— and we ’re very, very 
straightforward about it —is that inflation has come in  higher than expected, and bottlenecks have 
been more persistent and more prevalent.  We see that just like everybody else does, and we see 
that they ’re now on track to persis t well into next year.  That was not expected —not expected by 
us, not expected by other macro forecasters.   
Now, let me say, you know, it ’s difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal 
times.  When you’ re talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it ’s a whole 
different thing .  And you’ re talking about a pandemic that ’s holding people out of the labor force 
for reasons that we can sample, but we don’ t have a lot of experience with this .  So it’s very, 
very difficult to forecast an d not easy to set policy.  So we have to set policy, though.  So that ’s 
what we ’re doing.   
And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don’ t think that we ’re behind the 
curve.  I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 29  
 outcomes, and that ’s what we need to do.  I do think it would be premature to raise rates today.  
That’s not —I don’ t think that ’s controversial.  Certainly, I don ’t know anyone arguing for that 
today.  A nd the r eason is that there ’s still ground to cover to get to maximum employment .  And 
we don’ t want to stop that when there ’s good reason to think —there ’s still good reason to think, 
although it ’s been delayed, clearly, there ’s good reason to think that the economy will reopen, 
particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID .  That’s when we ’re 
really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are.   
And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we ’re seeing in global supply 
chains around goods and, frankly , now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger 
than the capacity of those ports —those things are going to work themselves out.  We have a 
flexible economy.  It ’ll take some time, but, you know, it took—you know, the experts managed 
to create a vaccine faster than, certainly , than I expected.  A nd I think this stuff will work itself 
out over the course of next year.  That is my baseline understanding, and that ’s a very widely 
held one  among people.  
But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to 
achieve price stability and maximum employment .  And we ’re going to let the data lead us to 
where we need to go.  Our policy will adapt —and has already  adapted —to the changing 
understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply- side story —which is also 
partly a demand story.  So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer at Marketplace.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our question s.  
So you announced that the F ed is going to taper at a rate of , starting at $15 billion a month, and 
that’s more than twice the pace of the last taper.  So why are you tapering faster this time?  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back 
in, I guess it was , 2013.  We were much farther away from maximum employment.  Inflation 
was much lower.  This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job 
openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people.  So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013 , where we still had quite a ways to go.   I mean , after we 
began that taper, it was  still many years before we reached what I would characterize as 
conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone  price stability.   
So this is quite a different situation, and , you know, the C ommittee unanimously felt 
today that we had met the test that we ’d articulated, and this was appropriate .  And this is faster 
than, you know, than what people had expected six months ago.  It’ s earlier and faster, and that ’s 
because our, as I mentioned, ou r policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it ’s 
clarifying itself, and that ’s partly because we see inflation coming in higher —so.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Mike Derby.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  Yes, thank you for taking my questi on.  I wonder if the F ed has 
given any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start passively winding down?   And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into 
what F ed bond buying actually does for the economy?  I n terms of its economic impact, have 
you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I ’m sure 
you know there ’s often been questions about , what is bond buying actually doing to help the 
economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.   So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you 
mention—we haven ’t gone back to them.  Now that we ’ve tapered, I expect that that ’s exactly 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 29  
 what we ’ll do in coming meetings .  And we ’ll do it in an orderly fashion, and we ’ll talk about 
reinvestment and all those things.  And w e don’ t have to make decisions on those yet .  But, you 
know, typically, when we ’re doing a new subject like that, we ’ll have a series of briefings and 
discussions .  And that ’s what we will now begin to do.   
In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there’ s a tremendous amount 
of research and scholarship on this .  And, you know, you can kind of —you can find different 
people coming out with different views .  But I would say, the most mainstream view would be 
that you ’re at the effective  lower bound, so how do you a ffect longer -term rates?   There are two 
ways.   One, so you can’ t low er rates —let ’s say you can ’t lower rates any further, hypothetically.  
So you can give forward guidance.  You can say, we ’re going to keep the rates low for a period 
of time, either [for] a specific period , [or] until certain conditions are met.  The marke ts will do 
the math, and that ’ll have an effect on longer -term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out 
kind of thing.  So that ’s one thing.  The other thing you can do is , you just go buy those 
securities, buy longer -term securities.   That will drive d own longer -term rates and hold them 
lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers.  
So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity.  People —you can 
service your debt.  You have more free cash flow.   You know, it ’s not different from what we do 
at the short end.  So that was discussed long before anybody did it.  That was —I think Milton 
Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, 
many years ago.  
So, anyway, that ’s how it ’s supposed to work.  A nd, you know, it ’s quite hard to be 
precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can’ t run 
two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment.  B ut most people  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 29  
 find—most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would 
expect, whic h is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we 
do what we do.  More accommodative  financial conditions lead to more economic activity , over 
time, with a lag .  So I think that ’s the main finding I would say on QE .  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ re going to go to Paul La monica at CNN.  
PAUL LAMONICA.  Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you’ ve addressed already questions 
about the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional F ed presidents and , you 
know, addressing  the American people to make sure that they can trust the F ed.  I was 
wondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own 
future, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you say—to the President and to s enators that , potentially, you know, will be voting on a 
renomination—about this , specifically with regards to your future as F ed Chair for a possible 
second term?  
CHAIR POWELL. So I ’m not going to—I won ’t have any —I will answer your question, 
Paul, but I ’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all.  
PAUL LAMONICA. Fair enough.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I will say, though, that I have briefed A dministration officials, and 
I’ve briefed people on Capit ol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it , and seeking 
their feedback, getting their reaction .  But, you know, this is —part of my job is —Congress has 
oversight over the F ed, and we take that very seriously.  So if you’ re on our, one of the two 
committees that has oversight over us, then I ’m in regular contact with you , probably.  A nd, you 
know, when something like this comes up, I ’m on the phone.  I ’m offering to meet with you and 
explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any conc erns people might have.  That ’s 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 29  
 just part of my job.  So I do that.  I don’ t talk about particular conversations .  But you can 
assume I ’ll always do that .  And I certainly did it in this  case.  
PAUL LAMONICA.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker.   
HANNAH LANG.  Hi.  I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio.   Is the 
Fed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned 
are you, ultimately , about banks ’ willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a 
permanent fix?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’ t have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right 
now.  We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that 
channel.  We ’re also —we also have a—there ’s a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, 
over T reasury [securities] markets , and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic , and 
what structural things may need to be done.  So that would be part of that workstream, and I 
know that there ’s a lot going on.  I ’m not sure when that report will be out.  
So it’s work under  way. That ’s one of the many issues that are part of that , along with 
things like central clearing of T reasuries, great er central clearing, and , you know, many other 
ideas.  It ’s important that we have a liquid T reasury [securities] market.  It’s a huge public 
benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, 
while also assur ing the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be 
the main dealers.   So we have to make sure that that ’s always a first order of concern as well.  
HANNAH LANG.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 29  
 BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  So, just to 
expand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill 
and in the A dministration .  You talked about what you’ ve done already, but I ’m just wondering 
if you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that , either from the public ’s view or from the financial community ’s view of the 
Federal Reserve’ s independence .  And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode 
and have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened?  
CHAIR POWELL  You know, I think it ’s too soon to say what the reputational  damage 
is.  I think , from the very beginning, my reaction was :  We need to deal with this 
straightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully.  And that ’s what we ’re going to do.  I mean , it’s, 
it means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this 
happens again, and I like to think we ’ve made a real good start on that.  If you think about it, you 
cannot execute a trade unless it ’s precleared, and then you have to say, “E xecute. ”  It’s not even 
a trade.  Really, there ’s no trading going on.  This is for investment and, you know, getting 
liquidity for life ’s expenses.  But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or 
purchase.   So I think it ’s a pretty good system.  We’ll always be looking to make it better.    
So in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think 
we have .  And I like to think it ’s enough, but it ’s going to, you know —we ’re just beginning to 
implement it.   We have to write the rules, which we’ re doing, you know, as quickly as possible.  
We need more people.  We’re going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the 
Board, and also, we ’re going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the F ed has 
more than —the S ystem has more th an 30,000 employees.  Not all of them, far few of them, will 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 29  
 be covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this , will, you know, will have 
to have technology access, and it ’s going to have to work efficiently.  So there ’s a lot of work to 
do to implement.   
You know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades .  And it was 
in place when I took over.  It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four C hairs .  And, 
you know, it was what it was .  And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it.  And part of 
that was, it wasn ’t uniformly enforced across the System.  I’m a big believer in the value of the 
Federal Reserve S ystem and the Reserve Banks .  But you had 12 different ethics officers at 
12 different Banks.  And you had ethics people here .  And, you know, compliance wasn’ t, it 
wasn ’t all exactly the same.   It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were—
you know, we didn’ t imagine the problems that happened.  And they may have actually been—I 
don’t know this —but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules.  
They were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said , don ’t do anything that 
would create that appearance.  I mean , that ’s clear .  This was a bad appearance.  
So, anyway, what can we do?  We are where we are.  It happened, and we just have to 
deal with it forthrightly and transparently and “ own” it and step up to this, you know, meet this 
moment.  I ’m totally committed to doing that.  A nd, again, if there are better ideas, I ’d love to 
hear them, but I think we have so far made a good start.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  When you say you spoke with A dministration officials, did that 
include the  President?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m not going to answer who I spoke to at all.  I just, I’ m not going to 
give you any names, so don’ t take that as a “yes” or “no.”  I’m just not going to start down that 
road.  
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 29  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  T hank you.  We’ re going to go to Jeff Cox for the last 
question.  
JEFF COX.  Yes, thank you.  Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment.  
We’ve seen what ’s been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers.  
Is there any feel ing there that maybe you’ ve been accused of “fighting the last war ”—that 
perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post -COVID environment and that full 
employment may not look like what it looked like before?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So, what ’s happening is , people are leaving their jobs.  They ’re 
quitting their jobs in all -time-high numbers —but , in many cases, going back into employment 
and getting higher wages.  So a lot of the higher wages you’ re seeing are for job switchers rather 
than incumbents.  So  that’s just, that ’s a sign of a really strong labor market , as opposed to 
people just running off and quitting.  There have also been —there are a significant number of 
retirements, and we ’ll just have to see what that means.   
So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic 
history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was 
the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire.  So maybe this was just catch -up on that.  I am a believer that , over 
time, you won’ t know how far —you won’ t know what can happen with labor force participation 
in advance.  You’re just going to have t o give it some time, because we saw that over and over 
again.  
There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is.  
Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 29  
 humble about what the limits are of labor force participation.  But we expect labor force 
participation to pick up.  We don’ t know the pace at which it will do so.  
So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think , at the very beginning of the 
recove ry, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in 
February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history.  There  was so much to like 
about that labor market, a really historically good labor market—never perfect, but a good labor 
market.    
We’re in a different world now. This is a —it’s just very different.  The pandemic 
recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest.  And wages didn’ t really go 
down.  And, you know, real incomes were  more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support] .  
All of this is completely unusual.  You know, an economy w here inflation was driven by services 
is now inflation where —all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a 
quarter -century.   
So you ask about full employment .  I think we have to—I ’m very open to the thought that 
it’s going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we ’re just going to learn more 
and more.  I mean , one thing we ’ll learn, I think, I hope we ’ll learn in the next, in the near term 
is, once the D elta variant really does continue to decline, what’ s going to happen to 
employment?  Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again?   If you look back, the three -, six-, and nine -month average job creation is between 
550,000 and 600,000.  So if you think of that as a stronger —you don’ t have to think back to the 
million -job months of June and July.  You can just think, okay, 550 to 600—if we should get 
back on t hat path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to s ee that, of course.  So 
November 3, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 29  
 we’ll know so much more .  And, believe me, we understand.  It’s a different world in so many 
ways .  And we ’re very open to that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for joining us today.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
December 15, 2021 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates 
near zero and  updated its assessment of the progress that the economy has made toward the 
criteria specified in the Committee’s forward guidance for interest rates.  In addition, in light of 
the strengthening labor market and elevated inflation pres sures, we decided to speed up the 
reductions in our asset purchases.  As I will explain, economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of  monetary policy , which will continue to provide appropriate 
support for  the econom y.   
Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year , reflecting progress on 
vaccinations  and the reopening of the economy.  A ggregate demand remains very strong, buoyed 
by fiscal and monetary policy support and the healthy financial positions of households and businesses.  The rise in COVID cases in recent weeks, along with the emergence of the Omicron 
variant, pose [s] risks to the outlook.  Notwithstanding the effects of the virus and supply 
constraints, FOMC participants continue to foresee rapi d growth.  A s shown in our Summary of 
Economic Projections  (SEP) , the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 5.5 percent 
this year and 4 percent next year.  
Amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers, the 
economy has been making rapid progress toward maximum employment .  Job gains have been 
solid in recent months, averaging 378,000 per month over the last three months.  The unemployment rate has declined substantially —falling 6/10 of a percentage point since our last 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 31  
 meeting and reaching 4.2 percent in November.  The recent improvements in labor market 
conditions have narrowed the differences in employment across groups, especially for workers at 
the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans a nd Hispanics.  Labor 
force participation showed a welcome rise in November —but remains subdued, in part reflecting 
the aging of the population and retirements.  In addition, some who otherwise would be seeking 
work report that they are out of the labor for ce because of factors related to the pandemic, 
including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus .  At the same time, employers 
are having difficulties filling job openings , and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many 
years.  How long the labor shortages will persist is unclear, particularly if additional waves of the virus occur.  Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the labor market to continue to improve, 
with the median projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of the year.  Compared with the projections made in September, participants have revised their 
unemployment rate projections noticeably lower for this year and next . 
Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the 
economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation.  In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints  are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the 
near term.  These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated , exacerbated by 
waves of the virus.  As a result, overall inflation is running well above our 2 percent longer -run 
goal and will likely continue to do so well int o next year .  While the drivers of higher inflation 
have been predominantly connected to the dislocations caused by the pandemic , price increases 
have now spread to a broader range of goods and services.  Wages have also risen briskly, but , 
thus far, wage growth has not been a major contributor to the elevated levels of inflation.  We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 31  
 upward pressure on inflation.  Like most forecasters, we continue to e xpect inflation to decline to 
levels closer to our 2 percent longer -run goal  by the end of next year .  The median inflation 
projection of  FOMC participants falls from 5.3 percent this year to 2.6 percent next year ; this 
trajectory is notably higher than pr ojected in September . 
We understand that high inflation im poses significant hardship, especially on those least 
able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food , housing, and transportation.  We are 
committed to our price -stability goal.  We will use our tools both to support the economy and a 
strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.  W e will be 
watching carefully to see whether the economy is evolving in line with expectations.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions hav e been guided by our mandate to promote 
maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  In support of these goals, the 
Committee reaffirmed the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate.  We also updated 
our assessment of the pr ogress the economy has made toward the criteria specified in our 
forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some 
time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor ma rket 
conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment .   
All FOMC participants forecast that th is remaining test will be met next year.  T he 
median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds ra te is 0.9 percent at the end of 
2022, about ½ percentage point higher than projected in September .  Participants expect a 
gradual pace of policy firming, with the level of the federal funds rate  generally near estimates of 
its longer -run level by the end of 2024.  Of course, these projections do not represent a 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 31  
 Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a 
year or more from now.  
At today’s meeting, the Committee also  decided to double the pace of reductions in its 
asset purchases.  Beginning in mid -January, we will reduce the monthly pace of our net asset 
purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage -backed 
securities.  If the economy evolves broadly as expected, similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, implying that increases in ou r securities 
holdings would cease by mid- March —a few months sooner than we anticipated in early 
November .  We are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because, with elevated inflation 
pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market,  the economy no longer needs increasing 
amounts of policy support.  In addition, a quicker conclusion of our asset pur chases will better 
position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes.  We remain prepared to 
adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.  And, e ven after 
our balance sheet stops expanding, our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to complete the recovery in employment and achieve our price -
stability goal.   
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Mr. Chair, we ’ll go to Rachel from the Washington Post . 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you ver y much, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for 
taking our questions.  The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 31  
 to keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum 
employment.  And  there are also three rate hikes penciled in  the projections for next year.  In 
order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like?  When will you 
know that that threshold has been met?  And how will that be communicated?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So maximum employment, if you look at our S tatement on L onger -
Run G oals and M onetary P olicy S trategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a 
broad range of indicators.  And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force.  We ’d also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different 
demographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers.  So that ’s a—that’s a 
judgment for the Committee to make.  The Committee will make a judgmen t that we ’ve achieved 
labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that —it is , 
admittedly , a judgment call because it ’s a range of factors.  U nlike inflation, where we have one 
number that sort of dominates , it’s a broad range o f things.  So, as I  mentioned in my opening 
remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment.  And you see 
that, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Great, thank you.  Steve at CNBC.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question is :  If—It’s often 
said that monetary policy has long and variable lags .  How does continuing to buy assets now, 
even though it ’s at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem?  Won’ t the impac t of 
today’ s changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current 
inflation problem?  And a ren’t you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 31  
 such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in 
March that you ’ll start to have any impact on the inflation problem?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, on the first part of your question, which is, “Why not stop 
purchasing now ?,” I would just say this :  We’ve learned tha t, in dealing with balance sheet 
issues, we’ ve learned that it ’s best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make 
adjustments.  Markets can be sensitive to it.   And we thought that this was —this was a doubling 
of the speed.  We’ re basically two m eetings away now from finishing the taper.  And we thought 
that was the appropriate way to go.  So we announced it , and that ’s what will happen.   
You know, the question of long and variable lags is , is an interesting one.  That ’s, that’s  
Milton Friedman ’s famous statement.  And I do think that in this world, where everything is —
where  the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very 
quickly.  And my own sense is that they get into —financial conditions affect the econ omy fairly 
rapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months.  Shorter than that, 
rather.  But in addition, when we communicate about what we ’re going to do, the markets move 
immediately [in response] to that.  So financial con ditions are changing to reflect, you know, the 
forecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were 
expecting.  But financial conditions don’ t wait to change until , until  things actually happen.  
They , they change  on the expectation of things happening.  So I don’ t think it’ s a question of 
having to wait.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Can I just follow up ?  Thinking about having to wait, is it still the 
policy, or the position , of the Committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete?  
Thank you. 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding 
accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation.  Since we’ re two meeti ngs away 
from completing the taper, assuming things go as , as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off 
before then, then, then what we —you would stop the taper potentially sooner .  But it’s not 
something I expect to happen.  But I do—I do not think it would be appropriate , and we —and we  
don’t find ourselves in a situation where we —where we  might have to raise rates while we ’re 
still purchasing assets.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, let ’s go to Colby at the FT. 
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, I’ m curious exactly how much 
distance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase.  
Back in 2014, the guidance was —that was given was for the fed funds rate to remain at the target 
level for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program.  Is that an approach you 
support now ?   O r does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we , we haven’ t made any decision of that nature.  And so, no, I 
wouldn’ t say that ’s our position at all .  We really haven ’t taken a position on that.  I will say that 
we did talk today–We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example.  And we went through the way—the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet , last time.  And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion.  They 
thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we ha ve at the current time, and that those —the differences that we see 
now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet .  And the same thing would 
be true about raising rates.  I don’ t—I don’ t foresee that there would be that kind of very 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 31  
 exten ded wait at this time.   The economy is so much stronger.  I was here at the Fed when we 
lifted off the last time .  And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full 
employment.  Inflation is running well above target , and growth is  well above  potential.  There 
wouldn’ t be the need for that kind of long delay.  Having said that, I —you know, we ’ll make this 
decision in coming meetings , and it ’s not —it’s not  a decision that the Committee has really 
focused on yet.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Let’s go to Nic k at the Wall Street Journal.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you, Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, 
in March you answered a question about maximum employment like this :  You said 4 percent  
would be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it ’ll take more than that to get to maximum 
employment.  More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of 
maximum employment that ’s achievable in the short run versus in the long run.  Has your view 
of the level of maximum employment changed this year?  And if so, how?  And how close is the 
economy right now to your judgment of the short -run level of maximum employment?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So the —you know, the thing is, we’re not going back to the 
same economy we had in February of 2020.  And I think early on, that was —the sense was that 
that’s where we were headed.  The post -pandemic labor market , and the economy in general , will 
be different.  And the maximum level of e mployment that ’s consistent with price stability 
evolves over time within a —within a  business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting 
[the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic.  So 
I would s ay:  Look, we ’re, we’re  at 4.2 percent now and it ’s been —the unemployment rate has 
been dropping very quickly.  So we ’re already in the vicinity of 4 percent.   
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 31  
 The way in which—The important metric that has been disappointing really has been 
labor force p articipation, of course, where we had widely thought —I had certainly thought —
that, last fall , as unemployment insurance ran off , as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools 
reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge , in labor force 
participation.  So we ’ve begun to see some improvement.  We certainly welcome the 2/10 
improvement that we got in the November report.  But I do think that it ’s—it feels likely now 
that the return to higher participation is going to take longer.  And, in fact, that ’s, that’s  been the 
pattern in past cycles —that labor force participation has  tend ed to recover in the wake of a strong 
recovery in unemployment, which is what we ’re getting right now.  So you—i t could well have 
been that  this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong— the 
number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled 
people back in.  But, really, it ’s the pandemic, it ’s a range of factors.  But the reality is, we don’ t 
have a strong labor force participation recovery yet , and we may not have it for some time.  At 
the same time, we have to make policy now.  And inflation is well above  target.  So this is 
something we need to take into— take into  account. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could —if I could  follow up, you’ ve talked recently about risk 
management.  And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates bef ore you’ re convinced that you’ ve achieved the employment test in your forward 
guidance?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So this is —this is  not at all a decision that the Committee has made .  
But you’ re really asking a question about how our framework works.  And, yes, ther e is a—
there ’s a provision, it used to be called the “ balanced approach”  provision , that says, in effect, 
that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum -employment goal and [the pursuit of] the 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 31  
 price -stability goal are  not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal 
and the —and the  speed at which we ’re approaching it.  And so that is, in effect, an “off-ramp ” 
which could , in concept , be taken and it ’s in our framework, it ’s been in our framework  a long 
time.  I ’ve talked about it on a number of occasions.  It, it  is a provision that would enable us to, 
in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment.  Now, 
we’re—as I said, we’ re making rapid progress toward maxim um employment in my —in my  
thinking, in my opinion.  A nd I don’ t at all know that we will —that we ’ll have to invoke that , 
that paragraph.  But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework —and has been , really , 
for a very long time.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.   Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  We’ ll go to Howard at Reuters.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks , as usual.  So I guess I got ta ask about the elephant in 
the room, which is the Omicron variant.  You know, this seems to already be pushing one of 
your colleag ues, the Bank of England, off its course.  Things have evolved very fast there.  
Hasn ’t quite hit the shores of the U.S. in full force yet .  But people seem to expect it to.  So I ’m 
wondering, in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more 
infectious , but less serious, variant of the virus?  Or are you simply confident that the U.S. 
economy can continue its divorce from the pandemic?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think there ’s a lot of uncertainty, which is why we —why we  
called it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk.  It’s—we, we follow the same 
experts and I —we , we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the 
same articles in the paper and the same research and , you know, so the —you mentioned the early 
assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from , from 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 31  
 existing vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease.  That ’s a first draft.  
We’re a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be.   It may well come to the United 
States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly .  That could easily happen.  
I think there ’s another step there, though—which is what ’s going to be the effect on the 
economy.  A nd that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to 
suppressing supply.  It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or 
hiring on top of what ’s already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave  of Delta that’ s 
hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern 
seaboard and now coming down.  W e’re having quite a wave of Delta.  So coming in on top of 
that, again, it ’s very difficult to say what the  economic effects would be.  I do think, wave upon 
wave, people are learning to live with this.  More and more people are getting vaccinated.  So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect , in 
the aggregate , people who are not vaccinated.  So the more people get vaccinated, the less the 
economic effect.  It doesn ’t mean it won ’t have an economic effect .  Delta had an effect of 
slowing down hiring.  And it actually —it had an effect on global supply chains.  And that sort 
of—that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out.  So it can have an 
economic effect.  I just think , at this point, we don’ t know much.  We’ ll know a whole lot more 
in three weeks , and we ’ll know more than that in six weeks.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But if I can follow up :  You’re clearly , sort of from a risk 
standpoint, comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon.  W hich sort of implies that 
whatever Omicron brings, you’ re comfortable the economy ca n handle it without quantitative 
easing.  
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Yes .  Yes, look, I think— if you look at the state of the economy and 
the amount —the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of 
demand for labor, look at inflation, lo ok at wages .  I think moving, you know, moving forward 
the end of our taper by a few months is really —is really  an appropriate thing to do.  And I think, 
really, Omicron doesn’ t really have much to do with that.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Let ’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hey, Chairman Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  I 
wonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater 
wariness around inflation . 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.   So I guess I would go back and— you know, it ’s been a 
continual process, really.  Inflation really popped up, right ?   In the late spring last year.  And we 
had a view —it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community—that this would be 
temporary .  It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it.  And 
there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said.  Certainly, we had five months of decl ining month on month— monthly 
readings of inflation, but we didn’ t see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other 
supply- side issues.  Then in September, I ’d say after Labor Day, we started to see—it started to 
become clear that this was both l arger in its effect on inflation and more persistent.  And , of 
course, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward.  We move d the taper forward and we —and it ’s a much faster taper than had been 
planned.  So we ’ve been adapting— I’ve been saying we ’re adapting our policy.  
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 31  
 So com ing to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November 
meeting —it was the Friday before the November meeting —and it was very high, 5.7 percent 
reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annual ized, for the 
third quarter, just before the meeting.  And I thought for a second there whether we —whether we  
should increase our taper ,  [We] decided to go ahead with what we had— what we had 
“socialized. ”  Then , right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the 
meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, 
and no increase in labor supply.  And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot , 
high reading.  And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to— we 
needed to look at , at speeding up the taper.  And we went to work on that .  So that ’s, that’s  really 
what happened.  It was essentially higher inflation and faster —turns out much faster progress in 
the labor market.  Really, what ’s happening is the unemployment rate is catching up— seems to 
be catching up—with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10  [declin e] over one 
cycle.  So that ’s really what happened a nd, you know, widely supported in the Committee today, 
as you can see—unanimous vote —but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know, 
this, this  move.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  If I could just follow up  quickly, you noted that the ECI was one 
of the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don ’t see signs that wages 
are actually factoring into inflation yet.  And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the wage picture as, as  you’ re making these assessments.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So —but  I said —you, you quoted me correctly .  It’s, it’s—so 
far, we don’ t see—wages are not a big part of the high- inflation story that we ’re seeing.  As you 
look forward, let ’s assume that the goods economy does sort itself out , and supply chains get 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 31  
 working again, and maybe there ’s a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing.  But 
what , what  that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation.  In 
particul ar—we don’ t see this yet , but if you had something where wages were persistently—
[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure 
on, on firms , and they raise prices.  I t would take something that was persistent and material for 
that to happen.  And we don’ t see that yet.  But with the kind of hot labor market readings —
wages we’ re seeing, it ’s something that we ’re—that we’re  watching.  And the other thing, of 
course, is , is rents, which are very important.  Yo u know, owners ’ equivalent rent.  That’s 
another thing which is very economically sensitive .  Unlike the things that are causing the 
inflation now , this is economically sensitive —and so would be expected to move up.  And so as 
the—as some things go down, the question is :  Where will we be when we come out the other 
side of this ?  And we need to keep our eyes on those things.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  We’ ll go to Chris at the AP.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Well, next  year, you could see growth 
slowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread more widely.  Would you delay rate hikes in that situation?  And how would you think about 
that?  And also, how would you explain rate  hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of 
situation, with inflation fading and growth slowing?  How would you explain rate hikes to the public, particularly those who may still be looking for work?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, you know, the SEP  is not a plan.  It’s not 
something we debate, negotiate over , or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should 
be.  People write down their , their  assumptions —their assessment of appropriate policy based on 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 31  
 their economic forecast.  And so the m edian —what you’ re talking about, the three rate increases, 
that’s the median of the Committee —the median of the Committee is also that growth will be 
4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year.  So that ’s a really 
strong econ omy.  And, of course, if the —if the  economy turns out to be quite different from that, 
then so will the rate.  You know, we —no one will say, “Oh, we can ’t change our policy because 
we wrote something down in December .”  No one ’s ever said that or will.   It will— the actual 
rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast.  So, for example, 
if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have 
an effect of slowing down rate increases.  B ut we ’d have to—you know, we look at our two 
goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thank you.  Let ’s go to Victoria Guida at Politi co. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to follow up on maximum 
employment.  So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so that there was a de- emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment.  
And, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation.  And that’s how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment.  So, I ’m 
wondering, you know, you’ ve talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure 
maximum employment .  But from what I understand, that ’s still basically :  The way that you 
know that you’ re there is inflation.  So is that understanding correct?  And how is —are those 
signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that ’s caused by, you know, 
these supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those sorts of things?  So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment?  
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Okay .  So let me st art by saying that the inflation that we got was not 
at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework.  This was—i t really 
was a completely different thing .  It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal 
stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply- side 
barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call 
a vertical supply curve.  So, you know, automobile purchases are very i nterest  rate-sensitive , and 
you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars ,  But it can ’t, because they don’ t 
have semiconductors.  So , so that —it was a very different kind of inflation.  This is not the 
inflation we were looking for under our framework at all.  It’s nothing to do with our framework.  
And our —the way we ’ve approached it is really nothing to do with our framework.  
But com ing to maximum employment, which is really your question.  H ow do you know ?  
So I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities.  When you—i f you want to look at 
maximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is 
wages.  It’ s one of the things you look at.  And, you know, it ’s—So I mentioned a number of 
other things .  You can get to 20, if you wanted to,  easily, but labor force participation, the 
unemployment rate, different age groups of —you know, prime -age labor force participation, in 
particular, gets a lot of focu s, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus.  And wages, that ’s, that’s  really 
one of the great signal s.  The quits rate is another one.  The quits rate is really one of the very 
best indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like 
they can get a better job.  And there ’s, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that 
going on—suggesting, again, that you’ ve got a very tight labor market.  
So on wages, that ’s the price indicator we look at to tell us, along  with all the other data, 
whether we ’re—whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 31  
 employment.  And so that ’s, that’s  how we think about it.  But the —one of the complications is 
that, again, we ’ve got to make policy in real time.  So how do we think about that?  Do we —if 
we think we can make labor , you know, participation might move up—i f we, let’s say we knew 
that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running 
way above target?  Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what ’s 
max—what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real 
time is , is one way to think about it.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Just to kin d of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise 
interest rates next year and, you know, it ’s—you ’re not certain whether you’ re at maximum 
employment, are you all going to point —when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to 
ways in which the  labor market could still improve?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes .  I mean, I —absolutely.  I , I think —well, whether or not we —
whether or not we  say “ we’re at conditions —labor market conditions consistent with , with  
maximum employment ” next year, we would all be open a nd I think expect, over time, that the 
level of maximum employment that ’s consistent with price stability would increase further over 
time—for example, through increasing participation.  So I —we would certainly —we would not, 
in any way, want to foreclose t he idea that the labor market can get even better.  But, again, with 
inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time.  We’ ve got to make that assessment 
in real time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Olivia from Bloomberg.  
OLIVIA ROCKEMAN.  Thank you.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell, and thank you for 
taking our questions.  I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force 
participation.  And I wondered, what do you think needs to change in the economy t o kind of get 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 31  
 a meaningful recovery in labor force participation, and also whether running the economy hot, 
like in the last expansion, is one way of doing that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever 
ran in the last—in the last expansion, if you think about it.  You know, the ratio of job openings, 
for example, to , to vacancies is at all -time highs .  Quits, the wages—all those things are, are  even 
hotter.  But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more?  You know, 
that’s—really , “Why is it low ?” is the question.  So there , there  are a bunch of answers , and all 
of them probably have some , you know, some validity.  Part of it will be that people —for certain 
people, they don’ t want to go back in  the labor force because either they ’re medically vulnerable 
or they’ re not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere.  That ’s one thing.  The 
lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it— not just for children, 
but for older people.  It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people ’s 
portfolios are stronger— they may go back to being a one -income rather than a two -income 
family.  The same thing with people ’s houses .  People buy—they have a mortgage , you know, 
with leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled.  And they might make —reach the same conclusion.  So they’ re—and people have 
savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn’ t spend on travel 
and things like that and also because of , you know, because of government transfers.   
So, for all of those reasons —and it ’s hard to know exactly the part each of them plays —
we, we have a situation where we’ ve had a shock to labor force participation that is not 
unwinding as quickly as , as many, as expected.  And people —in effect, a good pa rt of it is 
voluntary.  You know, people —and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that ’s, 
that’s  their, certainly their choice.  In other cases, it ’s something that will abate very quickly if 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 31  
 and when the pandemic gets under control.  And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know, 
maybe the less likely that people will come back because they ’re—you know, they get used to 
their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs.  That ’s, that’s  what the evidence would 
say.   
So it’s a range of  things.  It isn ’t that the economy lacks stimulus.  You know, usually, in 
every other expansion, it ’s that there aren ’t enough jobs and people can ’t find jobs and, you 
know, we ’re stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up.  That ’s not the problem 
here.  The problem is a supply- side problem, which—what it would take to work it out, I think 
it’s going to be time .  And the number -one thing would, would really be to have  the pandemic 
get under control.  That ’s what everyone would really like to see :  What does the labor force—
what does the labor market look like in a world without COVID?  That would be the thing that 
we’d really like to see but, you know, it doesn ’t look like that ’s coming anytime soon.  
OLIVIA ROCKEMAN.  And just to quickly follow up on that :  If some of the reason that 
labor force participation isn ’t back to, you know, February 2020 levels  is because people are 
voluntarily making life decisions that are d ifferent, does that make you think we ’re going to end 
up at a lower rate overall? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, there ’s a demographic trend underlying all of this.  And we 
actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion.  But—so one would 
expect over time that labor force participation would , would move down because an  aging 
population, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is.  So you would expect that , 
that the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down.   
The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 
2020—and, indeed, for the year or so before that —is a good one.  And , I mean, I —What we can 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 31  
 do is try to create the conditions .  There’s a lot of good for society when you have a tight but 
stable labor market, where people are coming in, they’ re getting into the labor force, they’ re 
getting paid well.  In the labor market we had before, we had, you know —the  biggest wage 
increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of 
years.  There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that.  H igher 
participation is one of them.  And we ’d love to get back there.  But, again, ultimately, we have 
the tools  that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation.  I 
mean, really, it might be —one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is 
actually high inflation, because , to get back to where we were, the evi dence grows that it ’s going 
to take some time.  And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we ’ve been 
having.  O ver the last 40 years, w e’ve had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded 
history, including the last one, which was t he longest in our recorded history.  That ’s what it 
would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we ’d like to see.  And to have that 
happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Ok ay, let’s go to Edward Lawre nce at Fox. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks.  Thanks, Michelle, and thanks for taking the question, 
Chair Powell.  So I was looking at the cons ensus data for estimated monthly changes on sales.  
And what you’ re seeing is fewer people spending at restaurants and d rinking places, more people 
spending at grocery stores.  You see electronic sales down 4.6 percent month over month, also 
department store sales down 5.4 percent month over month.  How concerned or what is your 
level of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus , or something else?  Thank you. 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  We see consumer  expense as very strong in this quarter.  I don’ t 
know, Edward, whether you’ re talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, 
but consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are 
going back to work and they’ re getting wage increases.  Admittedly, some of the wage increases 
is being eaten away by inflation.  But, n onetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really 
significantly because of increased employment and spending is—has been strong.  There may be 
something in the seasonality that this year ’s holiday spending may have been pulled forward.  
And, of course, the re may be effects from , from  Delta and there might be going forward from 
Omicron.  But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Ok ay, let’s go to Mike at Bloomberg.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month ’s or 
this meeting ’s economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely move d 
for 2022 and 2023.  You ’ve said you expect inf lation to fall significantly.  Is that because you ’re 
going to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade?  In other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates?  And does it suggest t hat 
maybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you ’re “behind the curve ”?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, actually, I ’m looking at the SEP here , and the median forecasts 
for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each.  So that ’s a significant —you know, in 
an SEP, that ’s a pretty significant move up.  You know, it ’s, it’s based on both of those things, I 
suppose.  I do think there ’s a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the 
bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the cours e of this year.  If you look at where B lue C hip 
forecasts are —which is, you know, a group of well -resourced, large forecasting operations with a 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 31  
 long track record—they ’ll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back -end 
of next year.   
I would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect.  There will be 
a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well.  And, you know, t hat’s the most likely 
case.    
I guess what —the thing I would want to say, though, is we can’t act as though that ’s a 
certainty , and we ’re not going to act as though that ’s a certainty.   There ’s a real risk now, we 
believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation 
expectations under pressure , and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has 
increased .  It’s certainly increased.  I don’ t think it’ s high at this moment, but I think it ’s 
increased.  And I t hink that ’s part of the reason behind our move today.  [It] is to put ourselves in 
a position to be able to deal with that risk.  And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk.  
We need to see more data.  We need to see how the inflation data and  the—all the data evolve in 
coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher 
inflation doesn’ t get entrenched.  For one reason, as I —as I  just mentioned, it’ s one of the two 
big threats, the other being the pandemi c itself, to getting back to maximum employment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Michael Derby at the Wall Street Journal . 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Yeah.  Thanks for taking my question.  So as the Fed shifts 
towards an accelerated taper, I wonder what your read is on financial -stability risks right now.   I 
mean, these periods can be—you know, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so far.  But, you know, what do you see in terms of stability risks?  Are there any parts of the financial sector that concern you right now?  And are there any significant systemic issues that are on your radar, you know, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that?  
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we have —we have  had now for a decade and more a 
four-part financial stability framework that we use so we can —we can  hold ourselves to the 
same kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually.  And there are 
four key areas :  asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and 
leverage among financial institutions.  So I would say asset valuations —I’m going to go really 
superficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say.  Debt  owed by 
businesses, you know, and households —households are in very strong financial shape.  
Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low.  But , 
nonetheless, it ’s something we ’re watching.  Funding risk is, by and lar ge, low among , among 
financial institutions .  But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know, 
would applaud the SEC ’s action this week.  Leverage among financial institutions is low , in the 
sense that [their] capital is high.  So, overall, you know, financial stability , that ’s how —I 
wouldn’t  make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces.   
In terms of the things, you know, that we ’re—that we’re  looking for , looking at, you 
know, it ’s the—it’s the  things we ’ve already talked about, to some extent .  It’s, it’s the 
emergence of a new variant that could , you know, that could lead to significant economic —if 
there were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy.  We don’ t see that.  We don ’t have any basis for 
thinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it ’s certainly one we’ re looking at.  I 
would say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know, always the most —you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with.  I think we know how 
to deal with bad loans and things like that.  I think more —a cyberattack that were to take down a 
major financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 31  
 stability risk that we haven ’t actually faced yet.  So I could go on with a list of “horribles,”  but I 
think that ’s a decent picture of where I would start.  
MICHAEL DERBY.  How about the cryptocurrenc y issues?  Anything that worries you 
there that ’s going on in there in terms of —you know, obviously a lot ’s happening in that sector .  
Does that concern you at all?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current 
financial -stability concerns.  I, of course, would support the , the views expressed in the 
President ’s Working G roup report on stablecoins.  Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, 
efficient , cons umer -serving , part of the financial system , if they ’re properly regulated.  And , 
right now, they aren ’t.  And, and they have the potential to scale  [up], particularly if they were to 
be, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have 
a payment network that was immediately systemically important—close to immediately 
systemically important that didn ’t have appropriate regulation and protections.  The public relies 
on the government —and [on] the Fed, in particular —to make sure that the payment system is 
safe and reliable, as well as the dollar and —you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted 
currency.  So —but I do think those are longer term.   
In terms of, you know, the more —the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really 
speculative assets, I don ’t see them as a financial -stability concern at the moment.  I do think 
they are risky, they’ re not backed by anything, and I think there ’s big consumer —issues for 
consumers who may or may not understand what they’ re getting.  And there ’s certainly 
developments in the —in the  markets that are worth following, which are really not in our 
jurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that ’s built into and those sorts of 
things is certainly worth, worth watching.

 MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer at Marketplace.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Chair Powell .  Hi, Chair Powell, thanks for the 
question.  Going back to inflation, is the Fed “ behind the curve ” on getting inflation under 
control?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say this .  I actually think we are well positioned to deal 
with, with  what ’s coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come.  I do.  And I think 
if you look at how we got here, I do think we ’ve, we’ve  been adapting to the i ncoming data, 
really all the way along , and, you know, noticing and calling out that , that  the—both the effects 
and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that.  So we ’ve 
been calling out the fact that those were be coming longer , and more persistent , and larger.  And 
now we ’re in a position where we ’re ending our taper within the next —well, by March , in two 
meetings, and we ’ll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it ’s appropriate.  
And we wil l, if that—to the extent that ’s appropriate.  At the same time, we ’re going to be seeing 
a few more months of data.   I don ’t actually think we ’re out of position now.  I think this was an 
important move for us to make.  I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was 
a—was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher —and that the risk of it 
remaining higher for longer has grown.  And I think we ’re reacting to that now .  And we ’ll 
continue to adapt our policy.  S o I wouldn’ t look at it that we ’re “behind the  curve.”   I would 
look at it that we ’re actually in position now to take the steps that we ’ll need to take, you know, 
in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of , of too-high inflation. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Evan at Market News.  
EVAN RYSER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you.  I was wondering if we should still be

 started shrinking the balance sheet when short -term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent 
range.  Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that 
this time?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Are they separate?  So our intere st rate —I mean, they are separate 
tools.  So the —you know, the , the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates.  
Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation.  I t just stops adding further 
accommodation.  W hereas raising interest rat es starts to remove accommodation from what is a 
highly accommodative stance.  You know, the extent to which they’ ll be separated in time is , is 
something we haven’ t really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet.  We will be discussing 
that, obviously, in coming meetings.   I don’ t think that, that —the last cycle, there was quite a 
long separation before interest rates.  I don’ t think that ’s at all likely in this cycle.  We ’re in a 
very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy.  You 
know, that —as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½  percent —
3½ percent  unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the —you know, headline inflation of 
2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7.  So thi s is a strong economy, one in which it ’s appropriate for, 
for interest rate hikes.  So they’ re separate, I would say.  Your —sorry, your second 
question was?  
EVAN RYSER.  My second question was about runoff.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Runoff.  
EVAN RYSER.  In the last cycle.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet 
discussion, sort of a prelim—a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week.  We ’ll have another at the next m eeting and another at the 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 31  
 meeting after that I suspect .  These are interesting issues to discuss.  [We] didn’t make any 
decisions today.  We look ed back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was 
interesting and informative.  And —but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a 
different situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance 
sheet this time.  So [we] haven’ t made any decisions at all about , about  when runoff would start, 
but we ’re—we’ll be continuing to— you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the 
end of the taper.  But those are exactly the decisions we’ ll be turning to in coming meetings.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Scott Horsley at NPR. 
SCOT T HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I think you said a few minutes ago that the 
inflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we —that you anticipated 
when you crafted the framework.  And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus with these supply -side hiccups.   Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken , or is 
the inflation just a consequence of —that we have to put up with because of that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, I ’m not expressing any judgment about , about  the stimulus in , in 
that comment.  What I ’m saying is , there ’s a— there’s a sense among some that “ you wanted 
inflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it ?,” you know?  And the truth is, this is not 
the inflation that we were —what we were talking about in the —in the  framework was inflation 
that comes from a tight labor market, right?  So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period , 
and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent.  And I —you know, I think, in that 
setting, our thinking wa s, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather 
than [acting] preempt ive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent 
unemployment would look like —with high labor force participation, by the way.  No one had 
seen what it would look—really look like for an extended period, for decades.  And we didn’ t 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 31  
 know what the inflationary implications were .  It turned out  there was barely 2 percent 
inflation —and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing.  So we 
incorporate d that into our framework.   
This is something completely different.  You know, that ’s a situation where you had a 
very, very high level of employment and low inflation.  This is literally the opposite.  Or, you 
know, it has been the opposite , where we have very high inflation and we ’ve had it since the 
labor market was in terrible shape.   It had nothing —so far, this inflation has really nothing to do 
with tightness in the labor market.   It does have to do with, with  strong demand, and strong 
demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress.  I ’m not making any judgments 
on Congress, it ’s not my job.  But I will just say, we ’re coming out of a, you know, what we 
certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic —the first really global modern 
pandemic —which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression.  And , you 
know, so we threw a lot of support at it  [the economy] .  And what ’s coming out now is, is, you 
know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing.  You 
know, people will judge in 25 years whether we —whether we  overdid it or not , but, you know, 
the reality is, we are where we are.  And, you know, we think our policy is , is the right one for 
the situation that we ’re in.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Brian Cheung.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Wanted to ask about the bond markets .  When 
you see the 10-year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment 
by which you might be hiking interest rates into?   Would you prefer the curve be a little bit 
steeper?  What are you gleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks?  
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I think the short -end actions are easy to understand, which is, 
you know, they’ re basically very [monetary] policy- sensitive rates at the short end , and it makes 
sense that  it’s reacting to changes in expectations for policy.  I think a lot of thing s go into the , 
you know, the long rates.  And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields 
around the world.  Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they’ re so much lower.  You can get —you 
can get , you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasur ies by buying USTs rather than bunds 
and you can —you can hedge , hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be 
way ahead.  So, in a way, it ’s not surprising that there ’s a lot of demand for , for U.S. sovereigns 
in a world —you know, in  a risk -free world where , where  there ’s so much —they’ re yielding so 
much more than bunds are,  than JGBs.   So that ’s, that’s  a big part of it.  
I also think, you know, there , there  may be some assessment in there of what the neutral 
rate is or what the terminal rate is.  I don’ t know about that.  But—and I would just say that we , 
you know, we write down our own estimates of the —of the  terminal rate or the neutral rate of 
interest.  Those are highly uncertain.  And, you know, we ’ll make policy based on what we ’re 
seeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral —what a model might say the neutral 
rate is.  We, we  all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were 
trying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out —you know, I think we learned a 
lot from seeing what happens.  We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to 2½ percent.  So I ’m not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is.  You know, I see that it ’s low.  
You know, I mean, we ’re really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we ’re focused on 
maximum employment and price stability.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the last question, we ’ll go to Greg Robb. 
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 30 of 31  
 GREG ROBB.  Thank you very much.  Chair Powell, I was wondering if —I want ed to 
give you the opportunity to talk about something that I ’ve heard that ’s been discussed —that, you 
know, your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy stance had something to do with the 
timing of your renomination by the President.  Tha nk you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure, I ’d be happy to talk about that.  So, as I mentioned, we got the 
ECI reading just before the November meeting.  We got the labor market report two days after 
the meeting .  And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI 
reading.  It was really the CPI reading , in concert with those two, and I , I just came to the view 
over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper.  And we started working on that .  That's 
a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me.  So, honestly, it had—it had  nothing to do with that at all .  And I just thought this is what we got to do.  My 
colleagues were out talking about the —a faster taper.  And that doesn’ t happen by accident.  
They were out talking about a faster taper  before the President made his decision.   So it ’s a 
decision that effectively was in —more than in train and, you know, to the point where people 
were talking about it publicly.  So that ’s what happened .  And it had absolutely nothing to do 
with it whatsoever.  We ’re always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I 
certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people 
that we serve.  
GREG ROBB.  Just a quick follow -up.  I guess that some people are saying that it was 
the, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over —we didn’ t really need all that 
stimulus , and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistak e and it would lead to 
higher inflation.  And perhaps that you didn’ t push back as much as you might have otherwise.  
December 15, 2021   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 31 of 31  
 CHAIR POWELL.  I didn’ t push back at all.  And the reason I didn’ t—and there was 
no—there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job.  We are 
not the CBO , and we ’re not elected by anybody.  So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front 
door, and we don’ t comment —you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it ’s 
really not our role.  And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter who’s in the White House, who’ s in Congress.  It ’s just —it’s just not our job and it ’s something 
we avoid pretty, pretty  assiduously.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Thank you, everyone.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
January 26, 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed 
to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment and 
price stability.  
Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy 
interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate.  The Committee also agreed to co ntinue reducing its net asset purchases on the 
schedule we announced in December —bringing them to an end in early March.  As I will 
explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving ec onomic environment, and it will continue to do so. 
Economic activity expanded at a robust pace last year, reflecting progress on vaccinations 
and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the healthy financial positions of house holds and businesses.  Indeed, the economy has shown great strength and 
resilience in the face of the ongoing pandemic.  The recent sharp rise in COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant will surely weigh on economic growth this quarter.  High -frequ ency 
indicators point to reduced spending in COVID -sensitive sectors, such as travel and restaurants.  
And activity more broadly may also be affected as many workers are unable to report for work because of illness, quarantines, or caregiving needs. 
Fortunately, health experts are finding that the Omicron variant has not been as virulent 
as previous strains of the virus, and they expect that cases will drop off rapidly.  If the wave passes quickly, the economic effects should as well, and we would see a ret urn to strong growth.  
That said, the implications for the economy remain uncertain.  And we have not lost sight of the 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 28  
 fact that for many afflicted individuals and families, and for the health -care workers on the front 
lines, the virus continues to cause great hardship.  
The labor market has made remarkable progress and , by many measures, is very strong.  
Job gains have been solid in recent months, averaging 365,000 per month over the past three 
months.  Over the past year, payroll employment has risen by 6.4 million jobs.  The unemployment rate has declined sharply, falling 2 percentage points over the past six months to reach 3.9 percent in December.  The improvements in labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution, as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  
Labor demand remains historically strong.  With constraints on labor supply, employers 
are having difficulties filling job openings , and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many  
years.   While labor force participation has edged up, it remains subdued, in part reflecting the 
aging of the population and retirements.  In addition, some who would otherwise would be 
seeking work report that they are out of the labor force because of f actors related to the 
pandemic, including caregiving needs and ongoing concerns about the virus.  The current wave 
of the virus may well prolong these effects.  Over time , there are good reasons to expect some 
further improvements in participation and empl oyment.  
Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent.  Supply and demand 
imbalances related to the pandemic and [to] the reopening of the economy have continued to 
contribute to elevated levels of inflation.  In particular, bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond to higher demand in the near term.  These problems have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, exacerbated by waves of the virus. 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 28  
 While the drivers of higher inflation have been predominantly connected to the 
dislocations caused by the pandemic, price increases have now spread to a broader range of 
goods and services.  Wages have also risen briskly, and we are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity [growth] could put upward pressure on inflation.  Like most forecasters, we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year.  
We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least 
able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  In addition, we believe that the best thing we can do to support continued labor market gains is to promote a long expansion, and tha t will require price stability.  We are committed to our price -stability goal.  
We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.  And we ’ll be watching carefully to see wh ether the 
economy is evolving in line with expectations.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote 
maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  As I noted, the Committee left the target range for the fed eral funds rate unchanged and reaffirmed our plan, announced in 
December, to end asset purchases in early March.  In light of the remarkable progress we’ ve seen 
in the labor market and inflation that is well above our 2  percent longer -run goal, the economy 
no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support.  That is why we are phasing out our asset purchases and why we expect it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.  
Of course, the economic outlook remai ns highly uncertain.  Making appropriate monetary 
policy in this environment requires humility, recognizing that the economy evolves in 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 28  
 unexpected ways.  We ’ll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible 
outcomes.  With this in mind, we will remain attentive to risks, including the risk that high 
inflation is more persistent than expected, and are prepared to respond as appropriate to achieve our goals.  
To provide greater clarity about our approach for reducing the size of the Fe deral 
Reserve’s balance sheet, today the Committee issued a set of principles that will provide a foundation for our future decisions.  [In] these high- level principles , [we] clarify that the federal 
funds rate is our primary means of adjusting monetary po licy and that reducing our balance sheet 
will occur after the process of raising interest rates has begun.  Reductions will occur over time in a predictable manner primarily through adjustments to reinvestments so that securities roll off our balance sheet .  Over time, we intend to hold securities in the amounts needed for our ample -
reserves operating framework, and in the longer run, we envision holding primarily Treasury 
securities.  
Our decisions to reduce our balance sheet will be guided by our maximum -employment 
and price -stability goals.  In that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of the details of our 
approach to balance sheet management in light of economic and financial developments.  The Committee has not made decisions regarding the specific timing, pace, or other details of 
shrinking the balance sheet .  And we will discuss these matters in upcoming meetings and 
provide additional information at the appropriate time.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -
stability goals.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questi ons. 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 5 of 28  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  For the first question, we ’ll go to Chris Rugaber  at the  
Associated Press.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thanks, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell.  So it ’s 
expected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting , but certainly in the past, the 
Fed has hiked at every meeting.  So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive 
meetings on the table this year?  Is every meeting a live —a live  meeting?  And, on that note, 
would the F ed consider f ront-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn ’t raise at every 
meeting?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  So , as I —as I  referred to in my opening statement, it ’s—it 
is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to 
prove appropriate.  And so, at this time, we haven’ t made any decisions about the path of policy.  
And I stress again that we’ ll be humble and nimble.  We’ re going to have to navigate 
crosscurrents and actually two -sided risks now.  So—and, and I ’ll say also that we ’re going to be 
guided by the data.  In fact, what I ’ll say is that we’ re going to be led by the incoming data and 
the evolving outlook, which we ’ll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and 
transparency —tran sparently.  
So more to your question, w e know that the economy is in a very different place than it 
was when we began raising rates in 2015.  Specifically, the economy is now much stronger.  The 
labor market is far stronger.  Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher 
than it was at that time.  And these differences are likely to have important implications for the 
appropriate pace of policy adjustments.  Beyond that, we  haven ’t made any decisions. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Victoria Guida at Politico.  
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 28  
 VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask, you were talking about the 
health of the labor market.  And I ’m curious whether you would characterize where we ’re at 
right now as maximum employment .  And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes 
[are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control 
without hurting jobs and wages?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sorr y.  Just getting both, both parts of your question written down.  
So I would say—and this view is widely held on the Committee —that both sides of the mandate 
are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in 
place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the 
pandemic.  And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are 
consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employ ment that is 
consistent with price stability.  And that is —that is  my personal view.  And, and, again, very 
broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate.  
The other thi ng is , maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the 
course of the business cycle.  In the particular situation we ’re in now, it may well increase .  
Max—the level of maximum—of employment that ’s consistent with stable prices may increase.  
And we hope that it will , as more people come back into the labor market, as participation 
gradually rises.  And the policy path that we ’re broadly contemplating would be supportive of 
that comment—that outcom e as well.  
So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are —there are many millions 
of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people.  So you ask whether we can—
whether we can raise rates and , and move to less accommodative , and eve n tight , financial 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 28  
 conditions without hurting the labor market.  I think there ’s quite a bit of room to raise interest 
rates without threatening the labor market.  This is, by so many measures, a historically tight 
labor market .  Record levels of job openi ngs, of quits.  Wages are moving up at the highest pace 
they have in decades.  If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful.  Look at 
surveys of companies —they find workers scarce.  And all of those readings are at levels, really , 
that we ha ven’t seen in a long time —and, in some cases, ever.  So this is a very, very strong 
labor market , and my strong sense is that we can —we can —we can  move rates up without , 
without  having to, you know, severely undermine it.  
I also would point out that there are—there are other forces at work this year, which 
should also help bring down inflation, w e hope , including improvement on the supply side, 
which will ultimately come .  The timing and pace of that are uncertain.  And also, fiscal policy is 
going to be less supportive of , of growth this year —not of  the level of economic activity , but the 
fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower.  So there are multiple forces —which should 
be working over the course of the year for  inflation to come down.  We do realize that the timing 
and pace of that are , are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we —than 
we thought.  And, of course, we ’re prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does 
not be come entrenched.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Good afternoon, Chair Powell.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street 
Journal.  I , I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet.  The stateme nt on the balance sheet 
today calls for “significantly reducing ” your holdings.  What does that mean?  And then, apart 
from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process?  And, finally, how much 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 28  
 disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than 
passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’m afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they’ re 
questions that the Committee is just turning to now.  So we had—we had  a discussion, as you 
know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues.  At this meeting, we ’ve gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a 
high level.  And those are meant to gui de the actual decisions we’ ll make about the pace and 
about all of the questions that you ’re, you’re  asking.  
And I expect that this process will , will be something that we spen d time on in coming 
meetings.  I can ’t tell you how many.  I can ’t tell you  how long it will take.  But —and then, you 
know, at the appropriate time, we ’ll provide additional information.  So I did—the last cycle 
when we —when we  went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over , over  the course of 
two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought.  
So we ’re just in that process now.  And at the next meeting, we ’ll be turning to, you know, more 
of the details that you ’re—that you’re  asking about. 
I would say this.  The balance sheet is, is  much bigger.  I ’d say it has a shorter duration 
than the last time.  And the economy ’s much stronger, and inflation is much higher.  So —and I 
think that leads you to— and I said , I’ve said this —being willing to move sooner than we did the 
last time and also perhaps faster.  But beyond that, it ’s really —it’s really  not appropriate for me 
to speculate exactly what that would be.  And , and—but I would point you to principle number 
one, which is “ the Committee views changes in the target range  for the federal funds rate as its 
primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.”   So we do want the federal funds 
rate—we , we want to operationalize that  [as the primary means] .  And we want the bala nce sheet 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 28  
 to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting 
reinvestments.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance 
sheet both restrain the economy, both tighten mone tary policy.  How should we think about the 
relationship between the two?  For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every 
¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, again, we think of the balance sheet as , as moving in a  
predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it ’s the federal funds rate.  There are—there are  rules of thumb —I’m reluctant to 
land on one of them —that , that  equate this.  And —but  there ’s also an element of , of uncertainty 
around the balance sheet.  I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions.  Balance sheet [policy] is , is still a 
relatively new thing for, for  the markets and for us, so we’ re less certain about that.  
So, again, our —I think our —the pattern we ’ll follow is to —is to  arrive at a, you know, a 
timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will— it will start in the background.  And then we ’ll look to have that just 
running in the background and have —and have  the interest rates, again, be the active tool of 
monetary policy.  That ’s, that’s  at least the  plan.  I can ’t tell you much more about any of the —
any of the  very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things.  But w e’ll be 
turning to all of those at coming meetings.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Now we ’ll go to Neil Irwin.  
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 28  
 NEIL IRWIN.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  It ’s Neil Irwin from Axios.  Glad to be back. 
Sir, I was wondering if the volatility we ’ve seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes 
you as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy.  Conversely, to the degree 
that financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your  tightening goals?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real 
economy:  maximum employment and price stability.  And financial conditions matter to the 
extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate.  And you also know that we , 
we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets.  And what 
we’re always asking ourselve s is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material 
enough that —of a change in financial conditions —that they are inconsistent with the 
achievement of our goals?  So that ’s how we ’re looking at that.  And I don’ t want to comment on 
today’ s financial conditions broadly, but we ’re not looking at any one market or , or so.  So that ’s 
how we ’re thinking.  
In terms of what we ’ve seen, I would say this.  We, you know, we said at our last meeting 
we published the  Summary of E conomic P rojections, the me dian of which—the median 
participant expected three rate increases this year.  And, you know, it ’s six weeks, seven weeks 
later now.  And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working.  Markets are, are  now pricing in a number of  rate increases.  Surveys show that market 
participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time , 
sometime later this year perhaps.  We haven ’t made that decision yet.  So we , we feel like the 
communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 28  
 that financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make.  And monetary 
policy works significantly through expectations.  So that , that  in and of itself is appropria te. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Howard Schneider.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  You know, for a year or so—Hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  
Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase.  Now that we ’re approaching that moment, what are the 
benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases?  I know you can’ t stipulate the path, but 
how s hould we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you’ re right.  We haven ’t got—we haven ’t gotten to that point  
yet.  We haven ’t made a decision yet, and we ’ll make that decision at the March meeting.  We’ ll 
make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate.  I would say that the Committee is , is of a 
mind to , to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are 
appropriate for doing so.  We have— we have  our eyes on, on the risks,  particularly around the 
world.  But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that  that 
should be temporary.  And we think that the economy should —the underlying strength of the 
economy should, you know, should, should—show thr ough fairly quickly after that.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow just on a related question, the December 
SEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of n eutral.  Given developments since then, do 
you still think that ’s a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think the p ath is highly uncertain and that we ’re committed to using 
our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we ’re seeing , does not become 
entrenched.  So a number of factors would be —it’s not just monetary policy —a number of 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 28  
 factors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned.  Fiscal policy will be —will provid e 
significantly less of an impulse to growth.  We do expect this year —although we do expect now 
that it will come slower than , than we had expected and hoped—that there will be relief on the 
supply side.  So that, too, should—should lower the supply- side barriers, which are a big pa rt of 
the story of why inflation  is high.  I n addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly 
less accommodative.  
So the question is —you know, we ’ll, we’ll be asking this question all year long, and that 
will be , are things turning out as we expec t?  There ’s a case that, for whatever reason, the 
economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected ; we’ll react to that.  If, instead, we 
see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we ’ll react to that.  And, again, 
we’re, we’ re well aware that this is a different economy than —than existed during the last 
tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Jeanna Smialek.  Let ’s go to Jeanna.  [No 
response]  Okay.  Let ’s go to Steve Liesman.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle.  The 
technical question is, if , if you’ re going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings 
and you won’ t begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to 
technically mean that you won’ t or can ’t begin balance sheet reduction until the summer.  I s that 
corre ct?  That ’s the first thing.  
Second of all, you suggested that , that  the—with balance sheet running in the 
background —that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 28  
 same time.  That’s sort of the  technical question part of it.  The principal  question I have is , you 
said it ’s going to be running in the background.  But the statement on the balance sheet principles  
says “ the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach ” based on “economic 
and financial developments, ” which suggests there ’s something of a reaction function associated 
to the balance sheet and it won’ t be running in the background.  So can you give us any sense of 
the discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction functi on surrounding the balance 
sheet?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me —let me —let me  start by talking about that last paragraph.  
So you’ ll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the 
balance sheet is a complicated o ne, and it involves , inevitably , surprises.  And so during, during 
the years , during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times.  
Now, we didn’ t intend to do that.  It just—events required us to do so.  So we got a pretty robust 
paragraph there that says we’ re free to do this at any time.  And it doesn ’t mean we’ re going to, 
but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we ’re not going to be —we ’re 
not going to stick with something that isn’ t working.  Th at’s all that ’s saying.  It’ s meant to be 
quite a general statement rather than a , a hint.  
So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is , is 
embodied in these principles .  So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is 
the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we ’ll use —determine the timing and 
pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we’ll  begin to 
reduce the size after we begin th e process of raising rates, and on and on like that.  I mean, that —
those are all the things that , that  try to describe how we will proceed.  
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 28  
 But maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question :  You know, asset purchases 
were , were  enormously import ant at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market 
function, as they were at —right after the —in the critical phase of the G lobal F inancial C risis.  
And then after  [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand.  And now the 
economy no longer needs this , this  highly accommodative policy that we put in place.  So it ’s 
time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance 
sheet.  Now, the balance sheet is, is  substantially larger than it needs to be.  We’ ve identified the 
end state as —in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and]  effectively in 
the ample -reserves  regime.  So there ’s a substantial amount of , of shrinkage in the balance sheet 
to be done.  That’s going to take some time.  We want that process to be orderly and predictable.  
And so those are some of the ways that I would think this , this  lays out our , you know, the way 
we—the way we ’re thinking about this.  
In terms of the timing, I can ’t really help you.  You know, it just says after , after  we get 
under  way.  So we ’re—I would say we are , we’re going to have another discussion at , at the next 
meeting.  And my guess is , we’ll have at least one other d iscussion at the meeting after that.  
And, you know, we ’ll, we’ll  tell you as we make progress.  And we ’ll, you know, we ’ll start the 
process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time.  It ’s—I wish I coul d say more.  But, honestly, we haven’ t made those decisions.  And we 
actually haven ’t even really had the , the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will 
have at coming meetings.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Craig Torres.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Chair Powell, Chair Powell.  Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair 
Powell.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.  Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 28  
 said risks are two sided.  And I ’m wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the 
elusive soft landing.  Is Fed policy a risk?  Overtightening?  Or what are the risks?  
And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question.  You know, 
Robert Kaplan’ s disclosure of his securities transactions—and in a couple of months, Chair 
Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns.  And we ’ll list transactions and all 
kinds of things.  And next to those transactions , we’ll put dates.  And Bloomberg asked for the 
dates of Mr.  Kaplan ’s transactions.  The Dall as Fed is not giving us the dates.  And I don’ t see 
why this is a matter for the i nspector general or anybody else.  I mean, why can ’t he give us the 
dates?  Will you help us get the dates of those transactions?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So you asked about t he risks first.  So I —you know, the one risk is 
that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of  most FOMC participants and , certainly , 
in my view as well.  There ’s a risk that , that the  high inflation we ’re seeing will be prolonged, 
and there ’s a risk that it will move even higher.  So we don’ t—we don’t  think that ’s the base 
case, but you asked what the risks are.  And that ’s—we have to be in a position with our 
monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes.  And that calls for  us to be in position.  
We, we  have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we ’ve got to 
be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains 
higher.  
And, of course, that is a risk to th e—to the —to the  expansion.  You know, we ’ve been 
saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over 
the last  [one] , which was  a record long expansion.  We saw labor force participation rise.  We 
saw wages persis tently higher for people at the lower end, and there , there really was no obvious 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 28  
 imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion.  It could have gone on for years were it 
not hit by the pandemic.  
So we’d love to find a way to get back to that.  Th at’s going to require price stability, and 
that’s going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation 
back down to our 2 percent goal.  
So I mentioned two- sided risks.  You know, a couple things.  One, Omi —COVID is not 
over.  And COVID can continue to evolve, and it ’s just —we have to accept that it ’s not over, 
and the risks to it can slow down growth.  And that would be —that ’s sort of a downside risk 
from a growth standpo int.  I would point to—you know, another , another  risk is just further, 
further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity.  And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that ’s—their no- COVID policy may cause more 
lockdowns , is likely to, and that may play into— may play into more problems in supply chains.  
In addition, there ’s what ’s going on in Eastern Europe and things like that.  So there ’s plenty of 
risk out there.  And we, you know, we can’ t—we can’t  forget that the re are risks on both sides.  
So that ’s, that’s  there.  That ’s what I would say. 
I know you’ ve been all over this issue with , with  my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of , of 
information.  We don’ t—we don’t  have that information at the Board.  And, you know, I hand—
I asked the i nspector g eneral to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands.  I play no role in 
it.  I seek to play no role in it.  And I don’ t—I really —I can ’t help you here today on this i ssue.  
And I ’m sorry I can ’t. 
CRAIG TORRES.  Okay, okay.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  We’ ll go to Jeanna now. 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 28  
 JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  And sorry for my 
tech issues.  I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands 
today.  You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your 
colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year.  And I wo nder if you still think that projection from December is a 
reasonable one.  And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you’ re thinking about 
that.  And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deceleratio n.  Like, how  do—how  do we get from here, 7 percent  CPI, to where you expect to be 
at the end of the year ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’d say, you know, since , since the December meeting, I would 
say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably sligh tly worse.  I ’d be inclined to 
raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation —let ’s just go with that —by a few tenths 
today.  B ut we ’re not writing , writing  down an SEP at this meeting.  B ut I think it ’s—it hasn ’t 
gotten better.  It’ s probably gotten just a —just a  bit worse, and that ’s been the pattern.  That ’s 
been the pattern.  
So I think if you look at the—the FOMC participants are—there ’s a range there.  And 
that range has been moving to the right for , for a year now.  And, by the way, if you look at other 
forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living , you’ ve seen the same 
pattern.  So , what do we think about that?  Well, I think we , you know, we wrote down rate 
increases in the December meetings, each of us ind ividually.  And I think to the extent the 
situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension.  So that ’s how 
we’re thinking a bout it.  
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 28  
 I—as I mentioned, though, I think it ’s—part of this will be that us, the Fed , moving away 
from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then, 
over time, to a policy that ’s not accommodative , in time.  I don ’t know when that will be.  
That’s—those are the things that we’ re—that we’re  thinki ng about.  That ’s, that’s  part of it.  
Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years.  That impulse will be less, in fact, will be —will be  negative this year.  And so that ’s another 
thing.  The other one is , we will eventually get relief on the supply side.  And, you know, the 
ports will be cleared up.  And there will be semiconductors and things like that.  Now, what 
we’re learning is, it ’s just taking much longer , so I think— longer than expected.  And that , I 
think, does raise, raise  the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.  I do think we ’ll come 
off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the —in the  spring last year.  But, 
really, what ’s—the question is going to be , what i s inflation running at?  And so we ’ll be 
watching that.  
And I , you know, we —our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent .  It’s also 
to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy.  The labor market is very, very 
strong right now, and I think that  that strength will continue.  There ’s a—there ’s really a shortage 
of workers.  We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in 
the lowest quartile.  You see very large wage increases.  I mentioned some of the other indicators.  So I think that ’s, that’s  what we ’re looking at.  And we ’re also —you know, we 
realize, I think, as everyone does , that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we ’re going to have 
to adapt.  And we ’re going to communicate as clearly as we can.  But we ’re going to have to be 
adaptable and , you know, move , move  as appropriate.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Great.  Thank you.  
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 19 of 28  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Colby Smith.  
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you, Michelle.  Chair Powell, when you talk about being 
humble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the 
possibility of raising interest rates by large r increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at 
some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently?  And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions.  We really 
haven’ t.  And , and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a 
different situation.  If you look back to where we were in 2015, ’ 16, ’17, ’18 when we were 
raising rates, inflation was very close to 2  percent , even below 2 percent .  Unemployment was , 
was not at our estimates of the natural rate.  And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent  
range.  
Right now , we have inflation running substantially above 2 perc ent and, and, you know, 
more persistently than we would like.  We have growth —even in forecasts, even in the 
somewhat reduced forecast for 2022 —we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than 
what we estimate to be the potential growth rate.  And we see a labor market where, by so many 
measures, it is historically tight.  I think the —you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is , is 
looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of  [the 
unemployment rate cons istent with] maximum employment.  If you look at things like quits and 
job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you’ re seeing —and, and just the ratio of job 
openings to unemployed —you’ re seeing a very, very tight labor market.  
Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower.  It ’s 
1½ percentage point s lower than it was in February of 2020.  Maybe a [full]  percentage point of 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 28  
 that is , is retirements.  Some part of those retirements are,  are, you know, rela ted to COVID 
rather than just regular retirements .  So we think there ’s, there ’s a pool of people out there who 
could come back into the labor force.  But it’ s not happening very quickly, and it may not —it 
may continue to not happen very quickly as long as  the pandemic is on[going] .  So that ’s, that ’s, 
that’s  how we think about that.  We haven ’t made —to your specific question—we really have 
not addressed those questions.  And we ’ll begin to address them as we— as we move into the 
March meeting and meetings after that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Michelle.  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our 
questions.  I’m wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed  uses to assess how 
inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower -, lower -income earners?  And 
are you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can ’t effectively measure , the impact of inflation 
on some of the most vulnerable households?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s, it’s more a matter of —I think the problem that we ’re—that 
we’re  talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck 
to paycheck, they’ re spending most or all of their —of, of what they ’re earning on food, gasoline, 
rent, heating their —heating, things like that, basic necessities.  And so inflation right away, right 
away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions.  So that ’s really the point.  I 
don’t—I’m not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different 
socioeconomic groups.  It’s—that’s not the point.  The point is , some people are just really in  
a—prone to suffer more.  
I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn’ t good.  It’ s bad.  High 
inflation is , is bad, but they’ re going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 28  
 their cars and things like that.  It’s more —so that , that ’s really how I think  of it.  And, you know, 
we, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans.  But part of —part of it is just 
that it’ s particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of 
their—of their income on necessities, which are —which are  experiencing high inflation now. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Michelle , and t hank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking 
the question here.  So year over year, inflation ’s at a 40 -year high.  Th e [increase in] input costs 
for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record.  Some investors fear that the 
Fed might be moving too late.  Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, 
but was a rate hike more than 25 ba sis points discussed today?  
And as a follow to that —because I have  problems with the mute button —as a follow to 
that, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year.  You 
talked about that today.  The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip 
shortage will last into 2023.  So today you said inflation will start to ease this year.  I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to 
be completely worked out by the end of this year.  I do not expect the m, and I have not expected 
them.  What I would say , and I have been saying,  is that I expect progress to be made in the 
second half of this year, mainly —progress because we’ re not making much progress.  If you 
look at a ton of metrics, you can find some th at suggest that delivery times are shorter and 
inventories in some industries moving up.  But, overall, we ’re not —we ’re not making progress.  
And, you know, things like the semiconductor issue a re going to —they ’re going to be quite a 
long time.  I would th ink they’ ll go more than through 2023. 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 28  
 In terms of —so in terms of being too late, I would just say this.  We—our policy needs to 
be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the 
possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we ’d expected.  And 
we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we ’re 
committed to doing that.  And that ’s, that’s really where we are.  
In terms of your , your  question about the , the size of rate increases, we haven ’t—we 
haven’t  faced those decisions.  We haven ’t made them.  It isn ’t possible to sit down here today 
and tell you with any confidence what the —what the  precise path will be.  But in —as we work 
our way through this , meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different  
expansion, as I ’ve said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger 
economy.  And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in —in the policy that we 
implement.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Mike McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I ’d like to sort of weave some of the 
strands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is. Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2  percent ?  Do you want to go 
below 2 percent  so that, on average, you get a 2 percent  inflation rate?  And because you said we 
have to protect the employment part of your mandate, i s there some sort of circuit breaker that 
would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, no.  There ’s no—there ’s nothing in our framework about having 
inflation run below 2 percent  so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome.  So the 
answer to that is , is “no.”  What we’ re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations 
well anchored at 2  percent .  That ’s, that’s  always the , the ultimate goal.  And we do that in the 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 28  
 service of having inflation —we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent  over time.  
And if inflation doesn’ t average 2  percent  over time, then it ’s not clear why inflation 
expectations would be anchored at 2  percent .  So that , that’s the way we think about tha t.  You 
know, it —what was the last part of your —of your  question?  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  I was asking if you’ re protecting the employment side of the 
mandate, whether there ’s some sort of circuit breaker there.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Nothing like that.  I mean, I would s ay you have a tremendously 
strong labor market.  And you have growth this year at —forecast to be well above —well above 
potential.  I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2  
[percent].  Most forecasts [of actual growth] ar e significantly above that for 2022, and that ’s 
even with, with  policy becoming substantially less accommodative.  So the labor market’ s going 
to be strong for some time. 
We’re —ideally , what we ’re trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent .  
And we ’re trying to do that in a process that , that, that  accomplishes—you know, that will also 
leave the labor market in a very strong position.  And no one really knows what that will take.  
Again, I would say that it isn ’t just monetary policy  that’s helping inflation get down.  It’ ll be 
supply- side improvements, and it ’ll be less, les s fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all 
likelihood.  
So—but monetary policy will do our job.  It is our job to get inflation down to 2  percent .  
And a situa tion where , where  the two goals are —the two goals can be in tension is a difficult 
one.  But I —but I  don’ t really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant 
threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher pa rticipation over time is 
high inflation.  And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these large r wage 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 24 of 28  
 increases that we’ re seeing now.  So we do hope to achieve , and our plan is to achieve , both of 
those goals.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I co uld— if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too 
much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being 
more forecast dependent in making decisions , rather than the state dependency you’ ve been 
using as a framework for the last year and a half or so?  
CHAIR POWELL.  State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we —if 
we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflatio n—actual inflation before 
we tightened.  And so that was a very state -dependent thought because, for a long time, we ’d 
been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared.  And that was the case for , for a number of years.  So in thi s particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring 
incoming data as well as the evolving outlook.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Michael Derby. 
MICHAEL DERBY.  Thank you for taking my question.  I want to ask you, with the 
benefit of hindsight, and I real ize, I mean, that is what it is.  But do you feel that, you know, 
monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we ’re having right now is because the government response, you know, 
collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it ’s too soon to write that history, really.  But what I would 
say is this.  The—if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the 
global  economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to 
their homes for weeks on end in  masks, and there are no vaccines , and it could be a really long 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 25 of 28  
 time to get them, you know .  And then, you know, you have —economic activity  drops by a 
shocking amount in one —so there was a real risk of lasting damage.  
And I think Congress responded remarkably with the —with the  CARES Act, incredibly 
timely  and very powerful.  People will —there ’ll always be flaws in these things.  B ut in real 
time, it was a remarkable achievement.  And we responded.  And what we were able to do was, 
you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what 
really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress 
enabled with the CARES  Act.  
So now, that was a lot of —that was a lot .  And what we did was a lot.  And, you know, 
now—so , what we have now is , we have the strongest recovery of any, any  country.  And we 
have —we have  a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we ’ve had, because 
we’ve, we ’ve put so much support behind the recovery.  And we ’re managing the , the relatively 
high- class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage.  So —and 
these are serious problems, very serious problems that we , you know, we ’re working as hard as 
we can  on. 
Was it too much?  Again, I ’m going to leave that to the historians .  And—but look, i n 
25 years, we ’ll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2- , 3-, 4-, 5-year period.  
And we ’ll say, you know, we ’ll have  a—we’ll have  a much better basis to make a judgment 
about the actions that people took.  But it was all founded, though, in a —in a  very strong 
reaction to a , you know, to a unique historical event.  And I guess I ’ll have to leave it at that.  I 
look for —I hope I ’ll be around to see how that looks in 25 years.  
MICHAEL DERBY.   Fair enough.  Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Jean Yung. 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 26 of 28  
 JEAN YUNG.  Thanks, Michelle.  Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield 
curve could flatten , or even invert , after rate hikes begin.  Would that worry you, and how 
important is that risk in the Fed’s considera tion for adjusting policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we , we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’ t 
control the slope of the yield curve.  Many flat —many factors influence longer -term interest 
rates.  But it is something that we watch, and , and  you w ill know that from when we had this 
issue a few years ago.  And we take it into account , along with many other financial conditions , 
as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook.  So that ’s, 
that’s  one thing I would say. 
Another is, currently, you’ ve got a slope.  If you think about 2s  to 10s, 2- year Treasury to 
10-year Treasury, I think that ’s around 75 basis points.  That ’s well within the range of a 
normal —of a normal  yield -curve slope.  So it ’s something we ’re monitoring.  We don ’t think of 
it as—I don’ t think of it as some kind of an iron law.  But we do look at it and try to understand 
the implications and what it ’s telling us.  And it ’s—but it’s  one of many things that we monitor.  
JEAN YUNG.  Can I follow  up real quick and ask, if it —if it did invert, would you tie it 
to U.S. fundamentals?  Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ d—that ’s, that’s  a good question in, in  real time.  Obviously, 
U.S. long- term sovereign debt is an —is an  important global asset.  And it —and the fact that our 
rates are so much higher than , than other risk -free sovereign rates around the world may put 
something of a ceiling on our —on our  rates.  I don ’t know.  But it would really depend on the —
on the  facts and circumstances at that time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Brian Cheung for the last question.  
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 27 of 28  
 BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  Within the 
context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, wo uld you describe what you want to do as a 
gradual hiking?  And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it ’s often the talking 
point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don’ t emerge.  Is that 
something that has a lso factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates?  
Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  I would describe what we ’re doing along these lines.  This is going to 
be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy 
that we put in place to deal with the —with the  economic effects of the pandemic.  And that ’s 
going to involve a number of things.  It’s going to involve and does involve finishing asset 
purchases.  It’s going to involve lifting off.  And it ’s going to involve additional rate increases as 
appropriate.  And we , we have —we ’re going to write down in March our next assessment of 
what that might be.  It ’s going to continue to evolve as the data evolve.  We need to be quite 
adaptable, I think, in our under standing of this.  
The last thing we ’re going to do is , we’re going to have a couple more meetings, I think, 
to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner.  And that ’s, that’s  something that we will also be doing as appropriate.  And I 
wouldn’ t—I don’ t think it’ s possible to say exactly how this is going to go.  And we ’re, we’re  
going to need to be, as I ’ve mentioned, nimble about this.  
And the economy is quite different this time.  I’ve said this several times now.  The 
economy is quite different .  It’s stronge r.  Inflation is higher.  The labor market is much, much 
stronger than it was.  And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year.  So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make —as we make monetary policy.  And 
January 26, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 28 of 28  
 you asked about financial stability concerns .  In connection with our policy–w as that your 
question?  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Yes.  Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set 
of] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part  of that  .  I didn ’t 
know if that was part of the discussion today.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I would just say this.  We,  we, of course, have a financial stability 
framework.  And what it shows is a number of , of positive aspects of financial stability.  But you 
mentioned, really , [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four.  So asset prices are somewhat 
elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing.  I don’ t really think asset 
price s themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that ’s because 
households are in good shape financially than they have been.  Businesses are in good shape 
financially.  Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing.  The  banks are highly 
capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong.  There are some concerns in the— in 
the nonbank financial sector around —still around money market funds, although the SEC is 
making—has made some very positive proposals there .  And we also saw some things in the 
Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis , which , which we ’re looking at ways to 
address.  But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable —are manageable, I 
would say. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  T hank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
March 16, 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL .  Good afternoon .  I w ant to begin by acknowledging the tremendous 
hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’ s invasion.  The human toll is 
tragic .  The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S . economy 
are highly uncertain . 
At the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy 
goals that Congress has given us:  maximum employment a nd price stability .  Today, in support 
of these goals, the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point .  The economy is 
very strong, and against the backdrop of a n extremely tight labor market and high inflation, the 
Committee anticipates th at ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be 
appropriate .  In addition, we expect to begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming 
meeting . 
Economic activity expanded at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, reflecti ng progress on 
vaccinations and the reopening of the economy, fiscal and monetary policy support, and the 
healthy financial positions of households and businesses .  The rapid spread of the Omicron 
variant led to some slowing in economic activity early this  year .  But cases hav e declined sharply 
since mid -January, and the slowdown seems to have been mild and brief.  Although the invasion 
of Ukraine and related events represent a downside risk to the outlook for economic activity, FOMC participants continue t o foresee solid growth.  A s shown in our Summary of Economic 
Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at 2.8 percent this year , 
2.2 percent next year, and 2 percent in 2024. 
The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.  Over the first two 
months of the year, employment rose by more than a million jobs .  In February, the 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 26  
 unemployment rate hit a post -pandemic low of 3.8 percent, a bit below the median of Committee 
participants ’ estimates of its longer -run normal level .  The improvements in labor market 
conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution 
as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, and while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued.  As a result, 
employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in many years .  FOMC participants expect the labor market to remain strong, with the median 
projection for the unemployment rate declining to 3.5 percent by the end of this year  and 
remaining near that level thereafter.  
Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent .  Aggregate demand is 
strong, a nd bottlenecks and supply constraints are limiting how quickly production can respond.  
These supply disruptions have been larger , and longer lasting, than anticipated, exacerbated by 
waves of the virus  here and abroad, and price pressures have spread to a broader range of goods 
and services .  Additionally, higher energy prices are driving up overall inflation.  The surge in 
prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine will 
put additional upward pressure on near -term inflation here at home . 
We understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least 
able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We know that  
the best thing we can do to support a s trong labor market is to promote a long expansion—and 
that is only possible in an environment of price stability.  As we emphasize in our policy statement, w ith appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, we expect inflation to 
return to 2  percen t while the labor market remain s stron g.  That said, inflation is likely to take 
longer to return to our price -stability goal than previously expected.  The median inflation 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 26  
 projection of FOMC participants is 4.3 percent this year and falls to 2.7 percent next year  and 2.3 
percent in 2024; this trajectory is notably higher tha n projected in December, and participants 
continue to see risks as weighted to the upside . 
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions have been guided by our mandate to promote 
maximum employme nt and stable prices for the American people.  Our policy has been adapting 
to the evolving economic environment, and it will continue to do so.  As I noted, the Committee 
raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point and anticipates that 
ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate .  The median projection for the 
appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 1.9 percent at the end of this y ear—a full percentage 
point higher than projected in December .  Over the following two years, the median projection is 
2.8 percent —somewhat higher than the median estimate of its longer -run value .  Of course, these 
projections do not represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty 
where the economy will be a year or more from now.  
Reducing the size of our balance sheet will also play an important role in firming the 
stance of monetary policy .  At our meeting that wrapped up today, the Committee made good 
progress on a plan for reducing our securities holdings, and we expect to announce the beginning of balance sheet reduction at a coming meeting .  In making decisions about interest rates and the 
balance sheet, we will be mindful o f the broader context in markets and in the economy, and we 
will use our tools to support financial and macroeconomic stability . 
As we noted in our policy statement, the implications of Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine for 
the U.S . economy are highly uncertain.  In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil 
and commodity prices, the invasion and related events may restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains —which would create spillovers to the U.S . economy through trade 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 26  
 and ot her channels.  The volatility in financial markets, particularly if sustained, could also act to 
tighten credit conditions  and affect the real economy . 
Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the 
economy often evolves in unexpected ways .  We will need to be nimble in responding to 
incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid adding uncertainty to what 
is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain moment .  We are attentive to the risks of 
potential further upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations .  The Committee is 
determined to take the measures necessary to restore price stability .  The American economy is 
very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary po licy. 
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals .  Thank you.  I 
look forward to your questions . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Jeanna at the New York Times. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thank you so much for taking our questions .  I 
wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you’ re considering the , you know, 
the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you’ re 
weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting “ behind the curve.”  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of 
a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated .  And why do I say that?  Aggregate 
demand is currently st rong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so .  If you look at the labor 
market, [you find that it is] also very strong.  Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 26  
 continuing at very high levels .  Household and business balance sheets are strong.  And so all 
signs are that  this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish —not to say 
withstand , but certainly  flourish —as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy .  So 
I guess that ’s how I would say I ’m looking at th at.  Of course, the objective is to achieve price 
stability while also sustaining a strong labor market .  And that is our overall objective .  But we 
do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Howard at Reuters . 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I was wondering, in the SEP s, you have 
quite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent .  I’m wondering, how much of that do you feel 
is the result of the Fed’s stiffer -than-expected action here?  You talk about monetary policy 
operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected?  
CHAIR POWELL .  I don’ t think that’ s a big piece of it, actual ly.  I think some of that is 
just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will 
hit our economy through a number of channels .  Highly uncertain, but, you know, you’ re looking 
at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices .  It’ll be—we think that will weigh on GDP to 
some extent .  So that ’s part of what moved th ose assessments down .  I don’ t think —I mean, I 
think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there . 
But remember, a s well, that 2.8 percent  is still very strong growth .  If we think that the 
potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between , somewhere around 1.75 percent , 
2.8 percent  is strong economic growth.  It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of 
the last expansion.  So , while it’ s lower than last year ’s 5.8 percent , it’s still quite strong growth .  
So I would say it ’s quite a strong forecast . 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 26  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So , in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or 
slower on the rate hikes?  “ Ongoing increases ” doesn ’t really tell us whether this is going to 
come in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year . 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, you know, the way we ’re think ing about this is that every 
meeting is a live meeting .  And we ’re going to be looking at evolving conditions .  And if we do 
conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then 
we’ll do so.  I can ’t be perfectly specifi c about it, but that ’s certainly a possibility as we go 
through the year . 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Rachel at the Washington Post . 
RACHEL SIEGEL .  Thank you, Michelle .  And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our 
questions .  I’m curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to 
come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the 
economy, and supply chains getting better?  And if you don’ t start to see that, how will you 
signal it?   What will you be looking for?  And what will you be looking for over the course of 
the year?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So I guess I would say that at the —before the invasion of Ukraine by 
Russia—so let ’s go back t o that .  I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would 
peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe 
stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year.  So 
now we ’re, you know, we ’re getting —we ’re going—we ’re already seeing a little bit of short -
term upward pressure in inflation due to higher  oil prices, natural gas  [prices]  a little bit but not 
so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices . 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 26  
 The other thing is that you ’re seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you 
know, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods .  So that ’s 
going to mean more tangled supply chains .  So that could actually push out [in time] the relief 
we were expecting on supply chains generally.  So I guess I would say that the expectation i s still 
that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year.  But if you look at where I 
read the SEP headline median , we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, 
and then we expect —though, particularly with the effects of the war , but also the data we ’ve 
seen so far this year —we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to 
come down, and then come down more sharply next year . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Let ’s go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal.  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, over the 
last six months, the Fed  has shifted its policy stance quite a bit.  Six months ago, you were still 
buying assets .  Most officials weren ’t projecting any interest rate increases this year .  And yet, 
despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then .  So 
how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates  to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the 
economy?   Thanks . 
CHAIR POWELL .  So that ’s one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that 
we—the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the 
balance sheet has come.  And I would just say, I would go back to “ the economy is very strong,”  
as I mentioned .  Tremendous momentum in the labor market .  We expect growth to continue .  As 
I—it’s clearly time to raise interest rates and begin th e balance sheet shrinkage. 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 26  
 And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today’ s meeting, I saw a 
Committee that’ s acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is] 
determined to use our tools to do exactly that .  You couched it in terms of real rates.  I would 
say, if you look at the SEP, you’ ve got people getting close to or even above , in many cases, 
their estimate of the longer- run neutral rate .  So I understand that doesn’ t do it for real rates .  But 
if you go out a year or two, many people are , in their forecasts , are having tight policy from a 
real interest rate standpoint.  
So that ’s something that we ’re focused on.  Of course, it ’s a highly uncertain 
environment .  And, you know, we don’ t know what ’s going to happen.  B ut we do know that 
we’re going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals —and that includes the price -stability goal.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Let ’s go to Victoria at Politico . 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  So , looking at the Summary of E conomic 
Projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent .  And 
then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be 
estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that ’s a littl e bit uncertain .  So I was just 
wondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the 
Fed itself raising rates?  And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin 
withdrew her nomination, what do you e xpect to do with the regulatory portfolio?  Do you 
expect to assign a G overnor in charge of that?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Okay , sorry.  Tell me again your first question . 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  My first question is , how much do you expect inflation to come 
down as a dire ct result of the Fed ’s actions? 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL .  Okay .  So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is 
clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include , potentially , the supply 
chain is getting a little bit better, certain ly base effects.  You ’re lapping— as you know, when you 
look at a 12 -month trailing window, you’ re lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, 
June of last year .  So there should be some effects from that in the  12-month picture .  Really 
what we ’re looking for, though, is month- by-month inflation coming down.  And so it ’s really , 
it’s all the things we’ ve been talking about, you know, that really haven’ t helped much , including 
the shift away from goods and back to services , including supply chains getting better , including 
labor force participation —all those things that have been sticky and not happening.  But a big 
part of it is, though, is the base effects I mentio ned as well . 
You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, 
of course .  And so you would see that more in ’23 and ’ 24.  But also , remember we started 
talking about rate increases last year.  For some months now , financial conditions have already 
incorporated a significant number of rate increases .  So it doesn’ t start today .  The effect, the 
moves are already priced into the market for a few months now .  So the clock is running on that, 
and I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well . 
So on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this .  You know, we have an obligation to 
carry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we ’re doing that .  That ’s what we ’re 
doing.  The committ ee is not active .  So what ’s happening is , things are coming to the full Board, 
and we ’re voting on them .  We’ re getting our business done .  You know, we got the stress test s 
done .  We’ ve looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that .  So 
we’re working ahead.  Of course, we don’ t have a Vice C hair for Supervision, as you mentioned.  
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 26  
 But we ’re making do with the situation we have .  And a good number of things have come 
straight to the Board for approval . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Let ’s go to Neil Irwin at Axios .  [Pause]  Let ’s go to Neil Irwin . 
NEIL IRWIN .  Hi, Chair Powell.  It ’s Neil Irwin at Axios .  Thanks for taking our 
questions .  In the s tatement of e conomic p rojections, we see a forecast of median 1.9  percent  fed 
funds  rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year .  Wonder ed whether that aligns with your 
own expectations , in particular on that point of overshooting the long- term neutral rate .  And, 
also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced:  front -loaded, back- loaded.  H ow 
high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I don’ t—Neil, I ’ve never talked about my own SEP projection.  
It’s in there , but I , you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that , because we just 
haven’ t done it .  It’s because we’ re, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the 
Committee and present that consensus.  So I wouldn’ t talk about my individual one . 
And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is —there ’s seven 
remaining meetings this year .  This isn ’t something we discuss or debate or agree on .  But there ’s 
seven remaining meetings, and there ’s seven rate hikes.  I would add there ’s also the shrinkage 
of the balance sheet , which , you people do the math different ways, but that might be the 
equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet .  So I don’ t—but I 
don’t know .  We haven ’t made any decisions on front -end loading or going steadily through the 
year. 
And, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do 
see more than seven or eight increases this year .  And I can’ t give you, I ’m not going to try to 
give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that .  But I  will say this, that we ’ll be 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 26  
 looking at the data as they come in.  We’ll be looking to see whether the data show expected 
improvement on inflation .  We’ ll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement .  
And we ’ll be going—each meeting is a li ve meeting .  And if we conclude that it would be 
appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we’ ll do so. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  [Long pause]  One second .  Okay .  We’ re going to try one more 
time.  Colby Smith at the FT.  [Long pause]  Okay .  We’ ll come back to Colby.  Let ’s go to 
Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Ye s.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Thank you, Michelle, for the 
question.  I have a more basic question .  The last time the CPI inflation —I know you look at 
PCE, but CPI inflation— was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds 
rate was 19.2  percent .  But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you 
believe the Federal Reserve is, in your mind?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I just would say a couple things .  We have the tools that we need, 
and we ’re going to use them .  And , as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to 
raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet .  We wi ll take the necessary steps 
to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor 
market.  And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we’ll do so.  I’ll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for . 
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the 
record on this .  What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that  [indaudible] — 
CHAIR POWELL .  We l ost you in the middle of the  question . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Edward, can you repea t that question?  
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 26  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE .  —t he impact that —given you’ re not actually confirmed and 
Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed’s 
ability to handle inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL .  None whatsoever .   
MICHE LLE SMITH .  Okay, let ’s go to Colby Smith at the FT. 
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you, Michelle .  Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee 
about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self -correct?  And 
to what extent does it alter both the Committee ’s confidence that long- term inflation expectations 
will not de -anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed  may need to 
raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot ?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  Thank you.  So , of course , that’s something we ’re watching report by 
report .  And we ’re certainly , we noticed it in the last meeting .  And it ’s part of the overall 
picture .  We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that ’s part of 
what ’s happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they 
were before the crisis.  In other cases, it ’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly 
across services.  And, yes, that is concerning .  In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the 
good side .  But, really , in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is , admittedly , a 
large category .  So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligati on to 
move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Steve Liesman at CNBC . 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Thank you.  Mr . Chairman , I wonder if you can help me understand 
the kind o f logic , if there is one , in the SEP here .  As I look at the median forecast, for example, 
for unemployment, it runs for the three -year window below the long- run rate .  I look at inflation 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 26  
 being above , over the three -year window , the long- run—or call it th e neutral —rate, so the 
economy still runs hot .  And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the 
funds rate above the long- run rate . 
I guess my question is this:  Are you not create —giving a forecast here that essentially 
suggests you will be continuing to run further “ behind the curve ”—and never really get in front 
of inflation , because the economy will continue to run hot?  And, kind of on a related issue :  You 
said earlier  [that]  inflati on will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally 
expected .  Isn’t that a choice you ’re making?  And, if so, why are you making that choice to let 
inflation run above price stability longer than you ’d like?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So o ur, if you look, our —first of all, there is no —you’ re 
looking at medians .  But understand that there ’s no, it’s not something we voted on.  It’ s not a 
plan.  But if you look, people do have their in —by  the end of this year, broadly, people are at or 
close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer -run neutral interest rate .  Okay .  So 
that should stop pushing —that should, in other words, that should be a removal of 
accommodation for monetary policy, basically .  At the same time, we will have done  significant 
balance sheet runoff .  And you can think of that as further . 
In the next year , and just looking at the median, you’ re now above the , you know, above 
the, what people estimate to be the longer -run median.  A nd also, in many people ’s forecasts, 
that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under , in real rates as well .  So why does 
unemployment remain at 3.5 percent ?  You know, it—I  mean, a couple points .  One is the 
connection between—in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between 
inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight.  
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 26  
 But this is —clearly , what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that , the idea 
that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the 
long run with 2 percent  inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, 
full-economy kind of —full -employment kind of wages , but not to a point where they ’re pushing 
up inflation anymore .  And , as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come 
down.  And, you know, the reality is , there are many, many moving pieces , and we don’ t know 
what will actually happen.  But no matter what happens, this is a C ommittee that is determined to 
use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched .  And so we are 
determined on that front, and we ’ll deal with what comes .  This is a modal , or most likely , 
expectation.  But we ’ll deal with what comes, whether it ’s better or worse . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Chris Rugaber at the AP . 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER .  Hi.  Thank you.  Well, let me follow up a bit on that.  I 
mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you ’ve 
penciled in without raising the unemployment rate .  And I ’m wondering, just what are the 
mechanisms you see in reducing demand?   I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed 
[funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it ’s through higher unemploym ent?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, if you take a look at today’ s labor market, what you have is 
1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person.  So that ’s a very, very tight labor market —
tight to an unhealthy level, I would say.  So, in principle, if  you were —let ’s say that our tools 
work about as you described, and the idea is, we ’re trying to better align demand and supply, 
let’s just say in the labor market.  S o it would actually, if you were just moving down the number 
of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 26  
 wages.  You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the 
economy.  
We’re hearing from companies that they can ’t hire enough people .  They ’re having a hard 
time hiring .  So that ’s really the thinking there , is, you know, these are fairly well -understood 
channels, interest sensitive.  And , basically , across the economy, we’ d like to slow demand so 
that it’ s better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a 
better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand.  And that , over time , should bring 
inflation down. 
And I ’ll say again, though, you know, we don’ t have a perfect crystal ball about the 
future, a nd we ’re prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability .  You know, as I 
mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there —you really can ’t have a 
sustained period of maximum employment .  It’s our—one  of our most fundamental obligations is 
to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability .  So we ’re very committed to that .  Of course, 
the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market.  That is our intention , and we believe we can do that .  But we have to restore price stability . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay.  Let ’s go to Scott Horsley at NPR . 
SCOTT HORSLEY .  Thanks .  And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground 
you just talked about, Mr . Chair .  I think I missed some of your answer there .  But I have a 
follow -up question on the labor force .  We have seen some gains in the prime- age workforce in 
the last few months .  I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers 
as the health outlook has changed.  Are we goin g to see more recent retirees following Tom 
Brady back into  the workforce?  And what would that mean for wages and inflation?  
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL .  It’s hard to say .  You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that, 
over the course of a long, steady expansion, l abor force participation outperformed expectations .  
And that was just a , you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn’ t—it was nowhere near as 
tight as this labor market .  But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force 
longer .  It wasn ’t so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement.  That ’s not 
something that happens , in the aggregate , very much.  But , so that ’s what was happening. 
And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome .  And, of 
course, our policy does not in any way preclude that .  This is a situation where wages have 
moved up at the highest rate in a very long time .  And people are able to quit their jobs and move 
to better -paying jobs in the same industry or different indus tries.  So it ’s a really attractive labor 
market for people .  And once , you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an 
even more attractive one .  So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply .  That ’s a good 
thing for the country.  It ’s a good thing for people . 
And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation 
more at risk .  That last part is , we’ll have to see whether , empirically , it winds up, works out that 
way.  But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well.  It’s not the only thing we ’re 
looking for, though, from inflation.  We’re looking for help from a number of different places 
and, most importantly, from our own policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay.  Let ’s go to Rich Miller at Bloomb erg. 
RICH MILLER.  Thank you, Michelle .  And thank you, Chair Powell .  I’m sorry; I ’m 
having some communication problems .  So I missed some of the stuff you ’ve said , and m y 
apologies if this has been asked .  Since the FOMC met last January, financial condi tions have 
tightened markedly, equity price s down, T reasury yield ’s up, bond spread ’s risen, yield curve has  
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 26  
 flattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar ’s up.  Is that welcome?  And would you like to 
see more in order to achieve your goals?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions .  That ’s 
how it reaches the real economy —by just the mechanisms you mentioned.  And remember that 
the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very 
aggressive , and appropriately so, fiscal policy , but also highly accommodative monetary 
policy— the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic .  So 
it is very appropriate to move away from thos e. 
And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher 
interest rates and just the sorts of things —we ’re not targeting any one or more of those things, 
but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal le vel so that —because we 
know the economy no longer needs , or wants , these very highly accommodative, this  stance, 
which , you know, so it ’s time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we 
do that by moving monetary policy itself to more  normal levels.  
RICH MILLER.  When you say “ move to  a more  normal setting ” for financial 
conditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where 
we are now .  Am I drawing the right inference from that?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, yes.  So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial 
conditions .  And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust 
in sync over time with monetary policy.  It’ s not any particular financial condition, but a  broad 
range of financial conditions .  They will reflect to some extent —they reflect any number of 
things .  But, yes , we need our policy to transmit to the real economy.  And it does so through 
financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 26  
 it’s at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less 
accommodative . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Just a little housekeeping note :  Those of you in this 
call may be having some tech issues.  If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly 
on www.federalreserve.gov .  You might go there for the audio.  And now we ’ll go to Jean Yung. 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you 
had at this meeting .  Can you give us any more details?  Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs 
or whether to increase those caps over what period , if there were any details?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes .  Thank you for asking.  So, at our meeting today and yesterday, 
we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance 
sheet .  And I ’d say we ’re now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we’ll 
actually begin a  runoff at a coming meeting.  And that could come as soon as our next meeting in 
May.  That ’s not a decision that we ’ve made .  But I would say that that ’s how well our 
discussions went in the last two days . 
So a couple things just to add.  We’ ll be mindful of the bro ader financial and economic 
context when we make the decision on timing, a nd we always want to use our tools to support 
macroeconomic and financial stability .  We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what ’s a highly 
uncertain situation already.  So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this . 
In terms of the —I would say this .  I don ’t want to get too much into the details , because 
we’re literally just finalizing them.  But the framework is going to look very familiar to people 
who are familiar with the last time we did this .  But it ’ll be faster than the last time .  And, of 
course, it ’s much sooner in a cycle than last time .  But it will look familiar to you .  And I would 
also say that there ’ll be—I’m sure there’ ll be a more detailed discussion of our —in the minutes 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 26  
 to our meeting that come out in three weeks , where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty 
much the parameters of what we ’re looking at, which I think will look quite familiar.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV.  
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you’ ve been operating on 
a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down.  That 
seems to be over .  But I ’m wondering how you would de scribe your reaction function now .  
What is it that the F ed is trying to do other than bring inflation down?  In other words, is it , we’re 
going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Ye s.  So I want to clear one t hing up again.  A nd that is that nothing 
in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates .  What we said in the framework changes was—and this was really a reflection of 
what had happened for the prec eding couple of decades, actually .  What we said was, if we see, 
you know, low unemployment, high employment , but we don’ t see inflation, then we ’re not 
going to raise rates ’ til we actually see inflation .  That’s what we said, and that was the sense of 
it.  There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates.  That ’s simply not in the framework .  In fact, quite the contrary .  The framework is all 
about anchoring inflation expectations at 2  percent . 
So I d o hear this, you know, that the framework —really, we can ’t blame the framework .  
It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation.  And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was .  But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework.  So , come to today.  
You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear .  What we see is a 
strong labor market .  We see a  labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation .  And we 
see the underlying economy’s  strong.  Balance sheets are strong .  Yes, there are threats to growth 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 26  
 from, you know, from what ’s going on in Eastern Europe .  And, but, nonetheless, in the base 
case, there ’s a pretty broad expectation of strong growth. 
But inflation is far above our target.  And, you know, the help we ’ve been expecting and 
other forecasters have been expecting from supply -side improvement, labor force participation, 
bottlenecks, all those things getting better —it hasn ’t come .  And so we ’re looking now to using 
our tools to restore price s tability, and we ’re committed to doing that .  And you see that, I think, 
in the S ummary of E conomic P rojections .  And you see that in the decision we make, and you’ ll 
continue to see it in the decisions we make , going forward.  
MICHAEL MCKEE .  If I could follow up by asking—I guess what you’ d call it i s the 
“Paul Volcker ” question :  You don’ t think unemployment is going to rise significantly , but, if it 
does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates?  
CHAIR POWELL .  The goal, of course, is t o restore price stability while also sustaining 
a strong labor market.  We have a dual mandate, and they ’re sort of equal .  But , as I said earlier, 
you know, price stability is an essential goal .  In fact, it ’s a precondition, really, for achieving the 
kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market .  We saw the 
benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market .  It pulled people back in, and there were 
really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the  long expansi on.  It, just , the pandemic 
arrived ; it was just a completely exogenous event .  So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it . 
We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market .  But 
we do understand also that, really, you can’ t have maximum employment for any sustained 
period without price stability .  So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the 
labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong.  We feel like the economy can handle 
tighter monetary policy . 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 26  
 MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo. 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Hopefully no tech issues here on this front .  
Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the F ed’s 
doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or 
understanding what the SEP is .  How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on 
future F ed policy going to address the inflation that they ’re feeling at the sto res on a daily basis?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Sure .  So I guess I ’d start by just assuring everyone that we ’re fully 
committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion.  We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the  source, have real effects on people ’s well -
being.  And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone .  But it ’s really , especially , on people 
who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where —I 
mean, we ’ve all  seen charts that show, if you’ re a middle -income person, you’ ve got room to 
absorb some inflation.  If you’ re at the lower end of the income spectrum, it’ s very hard because 
you’re spending most of your money already on necessities , and the price is going up . 
But it’ s punishing for everyone .  So it has been a difficult time for the economy .  But we 
do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier .  It may take longer than 
we like, but I ’m confident that we ’ll use our tools to bring inflation down.  You asked about 
rates.  So the way that works , I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually 
slow down demand for the interest -sensitive parts of the economy .  And so what we would see is 
demand slowing down, but just enough so that it ’s better match ed with supply.  And that 
brings —that will bring inflation down over time .  That’s our plan.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Jo Ling  Kent at NBC News . 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 26  
 JO LING KENT .  Hi, Chair Powell .  Thank you so much fo r taking my question during 
this today .  My question is a follow -up to what Brian just asked .  What is your message to 
consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, that is —yes, indeed .  I mean, as I just said, you know, I think 
we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart , that it’ s our obligation to restore 
price stability .  And, you know, we ’ve had price stability for a very long time and maybe come 
to take it for granted .  But now we see the pain .  I’m old enough to remember what very high 
inflation was like .  And, you know, we ’re strongly committed as a C ommittee to not allowing 
this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to 
more nor mal levels, which —our target is 2 percent inflation .  So we will do that . 
And I just would want people to understand that, and that ’s—but the way we do that is by 
raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet .  And so financial conditions will 
become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity.  That will slow the 
economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong .  And, you know, the good 
news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong .  And that means the economy, we 
think, can handle interest rate increases. 
JO LING KENT .  And as a quick follow -up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal 
Reserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession.  For the consumers 
out there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I , you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back 
down to 2 percent , while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very 
strong.  If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that ’s strong within the 
context of U .S. potential economic output .  So—and we expect that to continue .  And to the 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 26  
 extent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt .  But we do believe that 
our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down 
inflation .  We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market . 
The labor market is —it’s not strong in the ordinary sense of the word.  We have not seen 
a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every une mployed person or where there , if 
you add job openings to those who are employed, that ’s actually substantially a larger number 
than the size of the workforce , than the number of people who actually count themselves as in 
the workforce .  So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply.  And when that 
happens, prices go up.  And they—so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back.  
And we don ’t think we need to do this alone .  There will be other factors helping that happen.  
But we cer tainly are prepared to use our tools —and we will . 
JO LING KENT .  Thank you.   
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Simon at the Economist . 
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Hi .  Thank you, Michelle .  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Sorry 
to take you away from inflation for one minute .  May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and , 
specifically , the freezing of the central bank assets ?  Of course, that raises a similar risk for other 
sovereigns around the world and their biggest companies , potentially.  Any conce rns about , in 
the long term, how this might affect the dollar ’s status as the preeminent global reserve 
currency ?  And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds  of reassurance to 
other central bankers around the world?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally 
very in favor of these sanctions .  But let me say this:  S anctions are really the business of the 
elected government, and that ’s true everywhere .  So the A dministration and the Treasury 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 26  
 Department, in particular, and other agencies —they create these sanctions.  We’ re there to 
provide technical expertise, but they’ re not , it’s not our decisions .  And so I ’m reluctant to 
comment on sanctions really much because, again, they ’re not for us  [to decide].  We have a very 
specific mandate.  And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned .  So 
I’d have to leave it at that .  Sorry . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.  Let ’s go to Nancy Marshall -Genzer at Marketplace.  
NANCY MARSHALL- GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powel l.  Thanks for taking the question.  
You’ve been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great  thing, but are we 
possibly seeing the beginning of a wage –price spiral?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So the way I would say i t is this:  We, first of all, I would agree with 
the premise that wages moving up is a great thing.  You know, that ’s how the standard of living 
rises over time.  And , generally , it’s driven over long periods by rising productivity.  But what 
we have now, if you look at these , the wage increases that we have, we look at a—we ’re blessed 
with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things.  But right now, they’ re all 
showing the same thing, which is that the increases —not the levels , but the i ncreases—are 
running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent  inflation, our goal , 
over time .  And that may be —we don’ t know how persistent that phenomenon will be .  It’s very 
hard to say.  
And that ’s really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage –price spiral;  is that 
something that ’s going to start happening and become entrenched in the system ?  We don ’t see 
that.  You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those 
wage i ncreases looked like they may have slowed down to a  normal level .  But it comes back to, 
you know, what I ’m saying here —which is , there ’s a misalignment of demand and supply, 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 26  
 particularly in the labor market.  And that is leading to wages moving up at ways  that are not 
consistent with 2 percent  inflation over time .  And so we need to use our tools to, you know, 
guide inflation back down to 2 percent .  And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily 
strong labor market .  We think this labor market can  handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary 
policy.  And the overall economy can as well . 
But, ye s, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent  inflation, but it ’s 
good to see that moving up.  But it wouldn’ t be sustainable over too long of a period to see them 
moving up that much higher .  And that ’s because of this misalignment between supply and 
demand.  We expect to get more labor supply .  We did  last time .  We got more than we expected 
during the last cycle .  This time, we ’ve gotten much less than expected .  So it’s not easy to 
predict these things .  But we do expect that we ’ll get people coming back in the labor market, 
particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people’ s lives, something we 
all wish .  But , so that ’s how we think about it . 
MICHELL E SMITH .  Thank you.  For the last question, we ’ll go to Don Lee at the L .A. 
Times . 
DON LEE .  Hi, Chair Powell.  I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in 
hindsight, the F ed should have moved earlier .  And it sounds like today that you don’ t think that 
the F ed is late .  And , just wanted to get your clarification on that .  And if it is, if you still think 
that the Fed is “behind the curve,”  how much “ behind the curve ” is it?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So w e are not —we don’ t have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight 
in actually implementing real -time decisions in the world .  So, you know, so the question is —the 
right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time?   But 
that’s not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now .  So I think if we 
March 16, 20 22   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 26  
 knew now —of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages , really , and the inflation 
resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we kne w that that was 
what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes .  It would have been appropriate to move 
earlier .  Obviously, it would be .  But, again, we don’ t have that luxury . 
And then, so , but that ’s a separate question from your other question, which is “ behind 
the curve .”  And, you know, I don’ t have the luxury of looking at it that way.  You know, we are , 
we have our tools —powerful tools —and the Committee is very focused on using them .  We’ re 
acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market .  And 
what I saw today was a C ommittee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in 
particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that .  We’ re not going to let high inflation become 
entrenched .  The costs of  that would be too high.  And we ’re not going to wait so long that we 
have to do that .  No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get 
inflation back down. 
So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates b ack up to more neutral 
levels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be 
appropriate .  And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense t hat, [in] people ’s [contributions 
to the] SEPs , they do write down levels  of interest rates that are above their estimate of the 
longer -run neutral rate .  And there ’s also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at 
the details of the SEP .  But thanks for your question.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay.  Thank you all .  Thanks, Mr . Chair . 
CHAIR POWELL .  Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   
May 4, 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time 
in a couple years.  
Before I go into the details of today’s meeting, I’d like to take this opportunity to speak 
directly to the American people.  
Inflation is much too high, and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we’re 
moving expeditiously to bring it back down.  We have both the tools we need and the resolve 
that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.  The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two years and have proved resilient.  It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained perio d of 
strong labor market conditions that benefit all. 
From the standpoint of our Congressional mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability , the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and 
inflation is much too high.  Against this backdrop, today the  FOMC  raised its policy interest rate 
by ½ percentage point  and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target rate for the federal 
funds rate will be appropriate.  In addition, we are beginning the process of signif icantly 
reducing the size of our balance sheet.  I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy 
actions after briefly reviewing economic developments. 
After expanding at a robust 5½ percent pace last year, overall economic activity edged 
down in the f irst quarter.  Underlying momentum remains strong, however, as the decline largely 
reflected swings in inventories and net exports —two volatile categories whose movements last 
quarter likely carry little signal for future growth.  Indeed, household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand briskly.  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 24  
 The labor market has continued to strengthen and is extremely tight.  Over the first t hree 
months of the year, employment rose by nearly 1.7 million jobs.  In March , the unemployment 
rate hit a p ost-pandemic, and near -five-decade, low of 3.6 percent .  Improvements in labor 
market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage 
distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, and, while labor force participation has increased somewhat , labor supply remains subdued.  
Employers are having difficulties filling job openings, and wages are rising at the fastest pace in 
many years.  
Inflation remains well above our longer -run goal of 2 percent .  Over the 12 months 
ending in March, total PCE  prices rose 6.6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 5.2 percent .  Aggregate d emand is strong, and bottlenecks and 
supply constraints are limiting  how quickly production can respond.  Disruptions to supply have 
been larger , and longer lasting , than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broader 
range of goods and services .  The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resul ted 
from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is creating additional upward pressure on inflation.  And COVID- related lockdowns in China are likely to further exacerbate supply chain disruptions 
as well.  
Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine  is causing tremendous loss and hardship, and our thoughts 
and sympathies are with the people of Ukraine.  Our job is to consider the implications for the U.S. economy, which remain highly uncertain.  In addition to the effects on inflation, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, creat ing spillovers to the U.S. economy through trade and other channels.  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 24  
 The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for t he American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher 
costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks  that 
high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to restoring price stability.  
Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been 
adapting, and it will continue to do so.  At today’s  meeting , the Committee raised the target 
range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point and stated that it “ anticipates that ongoing 
increases in the target range will be appropriate.”   We also decided to begin the process of 
reducing the size of our balance sheet, which will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.  We are on a path to move our policy rate expeditiously to more normal levels.  
Assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in line with expectations, t here is a 
broad sense on the Committee that additional 50- basis -point  increases should be on the table at 
the next couple of meetings.  We will make our  decisions meeting by meeting as we learn from 
incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  And we will continue to communicate our thinking as clearly as possible.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal . 
With regard to our balance sheet, we also issued our specific plans for reducing our 
securities holdings.  Consistent with the principles we issued in January, we intend to significantly reduce the size of our balance sheet over time in a pr edictable manner by allowing 
the principal payments from our securities holdings to roll off the balance sheet , up to monthly 
cap amounts.  For Treasury securities, the cap will be $30 billion per month for three months and 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 24  
 will then increase to $60 billio n per month.  The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under 
this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon securities 
are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills.  For agency mortgage -backed securities, the cap 
will be $17.5 billion per month for three months and will then increase to $35 billion per month.  At the current level of mortgage rates, the actual pace of agency MBS runoff would likely be less than this monthly cap amount.  Our balance sheet decis ions are guided by our maximum -
employment and price -stability goals .  And, in  that regard, we will be prepared to adjust any of 
the details of our approach in light of economic and financial developments. 
Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertai n environment requires a recognition 
that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised to the 
upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid 
adding uncertainty to what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.  We are highly attentive to inflation  risks .  The Committee is determined to take the measures necessa ry 
to restore price stability.  The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. 
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Nick Timira os, the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, the 
unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years a nd at the bottom end of FOMC participants ’ 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 24  
 projections for the longer -run rate that you submitted in the projection s at the last meeting.  How 
has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March?   What 
does this imply for your inflation forecast?  And how has your level of confidence changed with 
regard to the feas ibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Thank you.  So  you’ re right —3.6 percent unemployment is just 
about as low as it ’s been in 50 years.  And I would say that I expect , and Committee members 
generall y expect , that we ’ll get some additional participation.  So people will be coming back 
into the labor force.  We ’ve seen that particularly among prime -age people.  And that will, of 
course , tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit.  I would also expect , though, that job 
creation will slow.  Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months —very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy.  And so we think—
with fiscal policy less supportive , with mone tary policy less supportive , we think that job 
creation will slow as well.  So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further.  But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation.  
Implications for inflation —really , the wages matter a fair amount for companies, 
particularly in the service sector.  Wages are running high, the highest they’ ve run in quite some 
time.  And they are one good example, or good illus tration , really , of how tight the labor market 
really is , the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades.  And that ’s 
because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market.  So we think through 
our policies —through fur ther healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example , of vacancy 
filling and things like that, and more people coming back in—we ’d like to think that supply and 
demand will come back into balance  and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 24  
 high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation.  That ’s 
our expectation.  Your third question was?  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing 
the economy into a downtur n. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So I guess I would say it this way:   There’ s a path.  There’ s a path by 
which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have 
vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level.  The re’re 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million 
vacancies, 6 million unemployed people.  So we haven ’t been in that place on the  vacancy,  sort 
of the vacancy /unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve.  We haven ’t been at that sort of level of 
a ratio in the modern era.  So , in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could 
see vacancies come down a nd, as a result —and they could come down fairly signif icantly a nd, I 
think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are.  And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially.  So there ’s a 
path to that. 
Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or 
outcome, if you will.  And I ’ll give you a couple of reasons for that.  One is , households and 
businesses are in very st rong financial shape.  You ’re looking at, you know, excess savings on 
balance sheets —excess in the sense that they ’re substantially larger than the prior  trend.  
Businesses are in good financial shape.  The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong.  
And so it doesn’ t seem to be anywhere close to a downturn.  T herefore, the economy is strong 
and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.  So, but I ’ll say , I do expect that this 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 24  
 will be very challenging;  it’s not going to be easy.  And it may well depend, of course , on events 
that are not under our control.  But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome , and 
that’s what we ’re going to do. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman,  CNBC.   Thanks for taking my question, 
Mr. Chairman.  You talked about using 50- basis -point rate hikes or the possibility of them in 
coming meetings.  Might there be something larger than 50?  Is 75  or a percentage point 
possible?  And perhaps you could wa lk us through your calibration.  Why one month should—or 
one meeting should we expect a 50?  Why something bigger?  Why something smaller?   What is 
the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Sure.  So a 75- basis -point increase is not something the C ommittee is 
actively considering.  What we are doing is , we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today.  
And we ’ve said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that 
are co nsistent with our expectations, there ’s a broad sense on the C ommittee that additional 50-
basis -point  increases  should be on the table for the next couple of meetings.  So we ’re going to 
make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we ’ll be paying close attention to the 
incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions.  And , finally, of 
course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they 
evolve.  
So the test is really just as I laid it o ut—economic and financial conditions evolving 
broadly in line with expectations.  And, you know, I think expectations are that we ’ll start to see 
inflation, you know, flattening out —and not necessarily declining yet , but we ’ll see more 
evidence.  We’ve seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 24  
 or flattening out.  We’ ll want to know more than just some evidence.  We ’ll want to really feel 
like we ’re making some progress there.  And we ’re going to make these decisions, and t here’ ll 
be a lot more information.  I just think we want to see that information as we get there.  It’s a 
very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance.  There are just 
so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.  So, you know, we ’re 
leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision a s we get there.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  I’m sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment 
rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the 
funds rate?  
CHAIR POWELL .  I don ’t think the one month is —no.  N o.  One month’s  reading 
doesn’ t tell us much.  You know, we ‘d want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a 
direction that gives us more comfort.  As I said, we ’ve got two months now where core inflation 
is a little lower, but we ’re not looking at tha t as a reason to take some comfort.  You know, I 
think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled—t hat inflation, in fact, is under 
control and starting to come down.  But , again, it ’s not like we would stop.  We would just go 
back to 25- basis -point increases.  It’ll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive.  But , again, 
our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50 -basis -point increases 
on the table at the next two meetings. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay.  Let ’s go to Colby. 
COLBY  SMITH .  Thank you.  Colby Smith from the Financial Times.  Given the 
expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed ’s target at year -end, what constitutes a 
neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate?  And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year?  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL .  So—neutral.  When we talk about the neutral rate, we ’re really 
talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down.  So it ’s a 
concept , really.  It’s not something we can identify with any precision.  So we estimate it within 
broad bands of uncertainty.  And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3 
percent .  And also, that ’s a longer -run estimate.  That’s an estimate for an economy that ’s at full 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  So , really , what we ’re doing is , we’re raising rates 
expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral.  But we know that there’ s not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there.  So we ’re going to be 
looking at financial conditions, right ?  Our policy affects financial conditions , and financial 
conditions affect the economy.  So we ’re going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on 
financial conditions.  Are they tightening appropriately?  And then we ’re going to be looking at 
the eff ects on the economy.  And we ’re going to be making a judgment about whether we ’ve 
done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability.  It ’s that.  So if that path happens to 
involve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those 
levels.  We won ’t. 
But, again, there ’s a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers 
don’t really feel.  You know, you’ re going to raise rates, and you ’re going to be kind of inquiring 
how that is affecting th e economy through financial conditions.  And , of course, if higher rates 
are required , then we won ’t hesitate to deliver them.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks , Chair Powell .  Neil  Irwin with Axios .  Do you see evidence that 
inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers ’ wage demands, businesses ’ 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 24  
 willingness to raise prices?  Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on 
inflation?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL .  We don ’t really see strong evidence of  that yet , but that does not in 
any way make us comfortable.   I think if you look at short -term inflation expectations, they ’re 
quite elevated.  And you can look at that and say, “Well, that’ s because people expect inflation to 
come down.”   And , in fact, i nflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply.  
Longer -term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to—but only 
to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures.  So you can look at that.  And I think that’s a fair description of the picture.  But it’ s really about the risks.  We don ’t see a wage–price 
spiral.  We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they ’re doing that, but there 
have been price shocks.  So I just think it takes you back to the basic point —was that we know 
we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal , neutral levels.  And 
we need to look around and keep going if we don ’t see that financial conditions have tightened 
adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we ’re not where we need to 
be.  So , again, you don’ t see those things yet , but I would say there ’s no basis for feeling 
comfortable about that.  It’s a risk that we simply can ’t run.  We can ’t allow a wage–pric e spiral 
to happen.  And we can ’t allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.  It ’s just something 
that we can ’t allow to happen, a nd so we ’ll look at it that way.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna . 
JEANNA SMI ALEK .  Great.  Thanks, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smia lek with the New York 
Times.   You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China.  
Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side.  And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them —I wonder what  you meant to convey by adding those . 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL .  Well.  So our tools don’ t really work on supply shocks.  Our tools 
work on demand.  And to the extent we can ’t affect , really , oil prices or other commodity prices 
or food prices and things like that, so we can ’t affect those.  But there ’s a job to do on demand.  
And that —you can see that in the labor market , where demand is substantially in excess of 
supply of workers.  And you can see it in the product markets as well.  But I guess I ’m just 
pointing out that —a couple of things.  For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in 
China, they’ re likely to , both, add to headline inflation.  And people are going to be suffering 
from that, you know.  People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but —even 
though they don’ t actually tell us much about the future path.  So the second thing is that they’ re 
both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains heal ing or even making supply 
chains temporarily worse.  So they’ re going to weigh on the process of global supply chain 
healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too.  So , in a way , they’re two further negative 
shocks that have hit really in the la st, you know, 60 days, 90 days.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi.  Victoria Guid a from Politico .  I want to follow up on that, 
because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play 
in inflation.  And I ’m just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of 
Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out , does getting back 
down to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain i ssues get resolved, since you can 
only handle the demand side, as you said?  Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don’ t resolve themselves , in order to try and get inflation back 
down to where you want it to be?  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL .  So, you know, I ’ll just say :  For now, we ’re focused on doing the job 
we need to do on demand, and there ’s plenty to be done there.  Again, if you look at it, it’ s 
essentially almost two to one , job vacancies to unemployed people.  There’ s a lot of excess 
demand.  The re’re more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size 
of the labor force.   So there ’s an imbalance there that we have to do our work on.  A very 
difficult situation —you know, you would look at core infla tion, which wouldn’ t include the 
commodity price shocks. And, you know, that ’s one of the reasons we would tend to focus on 
that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation.  I 
mean, we have to be sure that in flation expectations remain anchored.  And I mean, that ’s part of 
our job, too, so we ’d be watching that carefully.  And it puts any central bank in a very difficult 
situation.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Howard.  
HOWARD S CHNEIDER.   Howard  Schneider  with Reuters .  And thanks, and nice to be 
back.  So two questions.  One quick one.  You ’ve cited the 1.9 to 1 figure s o often now, I ’ve got 
to ask you, what would be a good figure there?  What would you like to see that come down to to think that you’ re in sort  of a noninflationary vacancy- to-unemployed rate?  And, secondly, on 
help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels?   Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year —how are you 
mapping that into household consumption?  Have they come down enough?  Do you need 
another leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Okay, so in terms of the vacanc ies-to-unemployment ratio, we don’ t 
have a goal in mind.  There’ s no specific number that we ’re saying , “W e’ve got to get to that.”   
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 24  
 It’s really , you’ ve got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance.  
And that depends not only on the level of those things —it also , it depends on how well the 
matching functions  in the labor markets are working.  Because, you know, the longer t hese 
expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge  curve shifts out.  
And that also tends to, you know, to help.  So there isn ’t a specific number.  I will say we were —
you know, I think, I think when we got to one -to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we 
thought that was a pretty good number.  But , again, we’ re not shooting for any particular 
number.  What we’ d like to see is progress, but we ’re not really looking at that. That ’s an 
intermediate variable.  We ’re looking at wages , and we’ re looking at , ultimately , inflation.  So, 
you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works.  You can think of it as, 
you know, interest -sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values 
broadly.  And , you know, the re’re big models with, you know, a lot of different  channels that are 
related to that.  You know, we don’ t focus on any one market —the equity market or the housing 
market —we focus on financial conditions broadly.  So we wouldn’ t be targeting any one market , 
as you suggest , for going up or down or taking a view on whether it ’s at a good level or a bad 
level.  We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions —all the different 
financial conditions inde xes, for example, which include equity.  But they also include debt and 
other , many other things —credit spreads , things like that —too. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Rachel Siegel here from t he Washington Post.  
To follow up fr om your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American 
people about when they will start to feel the effects of , say, a 50- basis -point rate hike or multiple 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 24  
 hikes?  How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or t heir rent or their gas 
bill?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand.  A nd some of us 
are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren ’t.  But it’ s very unpleasant.  
It’s just something people don’ t—when they experience it for the first time, you’ re paying more 
for the same thing.  If you ’re a normal economic person, then you probably don’ t have that much 
extra to spend.  And it ’s immediately hitting you r spending on groceries , on, you know, on 
gasoline, on energy, and things like that.  So we understand the pain involved.  So how do you 
get out of that?  And it ’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant , high nature 
doesn’ t get entrenched in  the economy.  That ’s what we ’re here for , one of the main things we ’re 
here for —perhaps the most fundamental thing we ’re here for.  And the way we do that is , we try 
to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is 
under less stress and inflation will go down.  Now, the process of getting there involves higher 
rates —so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that.  So it ’s not going to 
be pleasant either.  But in the end, everyone is bett er off.  Everyone — particularly people on 
fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.  And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices.  We ’ll do it as quickly and 
effectively as we can.   We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in 
unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown.  But , ultimately, we think about the 
medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done —the sooner , 
the better.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Edward.  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 24  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Edward Lawrence with the Fox 
Business Network.  So you’ ve talked in the past about consumer spending and how that  drives 
the economy.  Are you concerned , with this high level of inflation , that the consumer will stop 
spending—and what ’s the level of your concern— pushing us into a recession?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So the economy is doing fairly well.  W e expect growth to be solid 
this year.  And we see, y ou know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong—
and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts.  So , and  the labor 
market —if you look at the labor market , for people who are out of work and looking, there  are 
lots of job opportunities for —wages are moving up and at rates that haven ’t been seen in quite a 
long time.  So it ’s a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a 
wage increase in your current job.  So it ’s a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that 
it’s close to , or vulnerable to, a recession.  Now, of course, given events around the world and 
fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity.  
Certainly , it will not be —last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered 
from the pandemic .  As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent.  But most forecasters have 
growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  But we ’ve talked with economists who have advised 
Democrat s and R epublican P residents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on 
inflation that a recession is inevitable.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price 
stability without a recession —without, you know, a severe downturn;  without materially high, 
higher unemployment.  And I mentioned the reasons for that.  So I see a strong economy now.  I 
see a very strong labor market , for example.  Businesses can ’t find t he people to hire —they can ’t 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 24  
 find them.  So , typically , in a recession, you would have unemployment.  Now you have surplus 
demand.  So there should be room , in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting 
people out of work.  The issue will come that we don ’t have precision surgical tools.  We have, 
essentially , interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they ’re famously blunt 
tools.  They ’re not capable of surgical precision.  So I would agree.  No one thinks this will be 
easy, no one thinks it ’s straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do 
think we ’ve got a good chance to do that.  And, you know, our job is not to  rate the chances —it 
is to try to achieve it.  So that ’s what we ’re doing.  There are a range of opinions, though, and 
that’s only appropriate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Steve Dorsey.  
STEVE DORSEY .  Thanks .  Steve Dorsey, CBS.  You mentioned earlier , just now, 
fading fiscal policy.  Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from polici es at the 
White House and in Congress in combating inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL . You know, it ’s really the F ed that has responsibility for price 
stability.  And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity , we take it  as a 
given, and we don ’t evaluate it —it’ s not our job, really.  We don ’t have an oversight function 
there.  And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening , to try to sustain 
maximum employment and price stability.   So if Congress or the A dministration has ways to 
help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I ’m not going to get into making 
recommendations or anything like that.  It ’s not , it’s really not  our role —we need to stay in our 
lane and do our job.  When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, 
give other people advice  [laughter] .  Right now , we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job.  
And I ’ll stick to that.  Stick in our lane.  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 24  
 MICHELLE SMITH.   Steve Matthews.  
STEVE MATTHEWS .  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News.  A number of your 
colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to 
bring down inflation.  One, do you agree with that?  And , two, you’ ve recently spoke n in great 
praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 
1980s.  And while it ’s certainly not your desire —the soft landing is the big hope of everyone —
would this FOMC have the courage to endure recession s to bring inflation down if that were the 
only way necessary?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I think it ’s certainly possible that we ’ll need to move policy to 
levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral.  We can ’t know that today.  That 
decision is not in front of us today.  If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won ’t 
hesitate to do it.  I ’ll say again, the re’s no bright line, you know, that you’ re stepping over.  
You’re really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for  it.  
You’re looking at financial conditions and how that ’s affecting the economy and making a 
judgment.  Yo u know, we won’ t be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than 
the other one.  It’s much more about a practical application of our policy tools.  And we ’re 
absolutely prepared to do that.  It —wouldn’ t hesitate if that’ s what i t takes . 
So I am, of course —who isn ’t an admirer of Paul Volcker ?  I shouldn’ t be singled out in 
this respect.  But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him.  And I —
But I  would phrase it this way:  He had the courage to do what he thought wa s the right thing.  
That’s what it was.  It wasn ’t a particular thing.  It was that he always did —he always did —what 
he thought was the right thing.  If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through.  So that’s [what] the test is .  It isn’t, will we do one particular thing?  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 24  
 I would say, we do see , though—we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential 
for the country in coming years.  Without price stability , the economy doesn’ t work for anybody, 
really.  And so it ’s really essential , particularly for the labor market.  If you think about it, like if 
you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very—longest expansion cycle in our recorded history.  
In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to pe ople in the 
lower quartiles.  And it was, you know, racial , wealth , and income —not wealth, but income gaps 
were coming down, wage gaps .  So it ’s a really great thing.  We’ d all love to get back to that 
place.  But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability.  So , basically , we’ve 
been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic.  T his isn ’t anything like 
regular business.  This is , we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, 
in—since the Depress ion.  Then we have this outsize d response from fiscal policy and monetary 
policy.  Then we have inflation .  Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the 
commodity, you know, patch in half.  And now we have the se shutdowns in China.  So it ’s been 
a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years.  So we have to look through that and look at the economy that ’s coming out the other side.  
And we need to somehow find price stability out of this.  And it ’s obviously going to be very 
challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with.  So I guess that ’s how I think about it. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Chris R ugab er. 
CHRIS TOPHER  RUGABER .  Thank you.  Chris Ru gaber, Associated Press.  Earlier, 
you just said that if necessary— I think were the words —that you would, or if it , if it turned out 
to be necessary, or you said that it’ s possible that we ’ll need to move polic y to restrictive levels.  
Given where inflation is and the hot economy is —or, certainly , the hot labor market, as you 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 24  
 described it —why still the hesitation?  I mean, what else do you need to see in order to 
determine that?  Wouldn’ t the F ed naturally be lo oking to go to a restrictive level at this point?  
Thank you.  
CHAIR POWEL L.  So I didn’ t—if I said “ necessary ,” I meant to say “ appropriate. ”  
We’re not going to be erecting a high barrier for this.  It ’s more , if we think it’ s appropriate.  
You know, the point is, we ’re a very long way from neutral now.  We ’re moving there 
expeditiously, a nd we ’ll continue to do so.  And we can ’t make that decision , really , today.  The 
decision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neut ral.  And, 
you know, I expect we ’ll get there expeditiously, as I ’ve mentioned.  So it ’s not that we don’ t 
want to —making that decision today wouldn’ t really mean anything.  But I ’ll say again, if we do 
believe that it’ s appropriate to go to those levels, we won ’t hesitate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Michael  McKee.  
MICHAEL  MCKEE .  Mike Mc Kee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  The balance 
sheet —why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not 
immediately start in the middle of this month , say?  And do you have another, a newer or a 
better , estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline?  And then, 
finally, I ’m just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your 
remarks?  Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, why June 1?   It was just , pick a date, you know, and that 
happened to be the date that we picked.  It was —nothing magic about it.  You know, it ’s not 
going to have any macroeconomic significance over time.  We just picked that.  Sometimes we 
publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that ’s what we ’re doing.  I wouldn’ t 
read anything into it.  In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stre ss how uncertain the effect 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 24  
 is of shrinking the balance sheet.  You know, we run these models —and everyone does in this 
field—and make estimates of  what will be , how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of 
balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantit ative easing?  And, you know, these are very 
uncertain.  I really can ’t be any clearer.  There won ’t be any clearer  [estimates] .  You know, 
people estimate that , broadly, on the path we ’re on —and this will be taken, probably, too 
seriously—but sort of ¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace.  But I 
would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands —very wide.  We don ’t really know .  There are 
other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way.  And some of you may read about that.  That ’s kind of a mainstream estimate.   We know that it is part of returning to more normal , 
more neutral financial conditions.  And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the  interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy.  
In terms of speaking to the American people , so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us , 
really , that that’ s who we work for, and that it ’s inflation that people are feeling all over the 
country.  And it ’s very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are 
working hard on fixing it.  I thought it was quite important to do that.  And so that was really the thinking behind that. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Do you think the F ed has a credibility problem?  
CHAIR POWELL .  No, I don’ t.  And a good example of why would be —in the fourth 
quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year , 
you saw financial markets reacting , you know, very appropriately.  Not to bless any particular 
day’s measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to 
our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy.  I t’s—monetary policy is working 
through e xpectations now, to a very large extent.  We’ ve only done two rate increases.  But if 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 24  
 you look at financial conditions , the two -year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now.  In September, I 
think it was a t 20 basis points . 
And that ’s all through the economy.  People are feeling th ose higher  rates already.  And 
so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible.  And I think we want 
to keep it that way.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Scott Horsley.  [No response]  Okay.  Brian Ch eung. 
BRIAN CH EUNG.  H i there.  Brian Ch eung with Yahoo Finance.  To expand on Steve ’s 
question about Paul Volcker , there was also a great pain that came with that as well —higher 
interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses.  I’m wondering how you kind of 
square what might be demand disruption.  Are you already seeing that ?  Is the idea here to 
incentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments ?  
Is that essentially what’ s happening thr ough this hiking cycle?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, so , as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is 
substantially in excess of supply.  And what you’ re seeing as a result of that is prices going up 
and at unsustainable levels , levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation.  And so what 
our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates :  it moves down.  Interest rates, 
you know —businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less.  That ’s 
how it works.  But , ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in 
balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where 
people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about infla tion.  I mean, so, yes, there 
may be some pain associated with getting back to that.  But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Greg Robb.  
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 24  
 GREG ROBB .  Thank you.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch .  I 
was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about , in March the dot plot had, you 
know, looked  like steady quarter -point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of 
the year.  Now—where it seems like you ’re much more aggressive.  So could you talk about the 
thinking that ’s behind that?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, look, I think what you’ ve seen is —really, I would say, in the 
middle of last fall—there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with 
what the data were saying.  If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports.  And inflation —month by month, inflation had com e down till September, a few months in a row , 
stayed low.  And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy.  And by the way—then , with the restatement of 
the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second 
half of the year.  But that hadn’ t happened yet.  Anyway, we got an ECI reading—e mployment 
compensation, [employment cost]  index reading— the Friday before the November meeting.  
Then we got a really strong jobs report .  Then we got a really high CPI report.  And so I think it 
became clear to the C ommittee that we needed to adjust and adapt.  And we have.  Ever since 
then, really  ever since then , we’ve been adapting.  We, you know —the C ommittee moved by the 
time of the December meeting to a median [in participants’ 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting.   And that process is going 
on.  And it ’s clearly continuing.  And that ’s why I say—and I actually mentioned this at the 
March meeting —that no one should look at any single S EP as sort of a real resting place for 90 
days, because we ’re in a fast -evolving situation.  And that ’s what ’s happened.  You can see—
unanimous vote today, of course .  And I told you the guidance —that broad support on the 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 24  
 Committee to have 50- basis -point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings.  So you’ re 
right.  And by the way, other forecasters have bee n doing the same thing.  And it ’s just us 
adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Thanks.  We’ ll go to Nancy for the last question.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZ ER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, I  want to ask how you’ re able to balance your dual mandate—stable prices and 
maximum employment —especially when the unemployment rate for B lack workers is still 
roughly double , roughly twice the rate for white workers.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot 
and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit.  So that ’s one thing I 
would say.  And that ’s important.  But the bigger point is this :  I do not , at this time, see the two 
sides of the mandate as in  tension.  I don ’t, because you can see that the labor market is out of 
balance.  You can see that there’ s a labor shortage.  There aren ’t enough people to fill these job 
openings.  And companies can’ t hire , and wa ges are moving up at levels that would not , over 
time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  And , of course, everyone loves to see 
wages go up.  And it ’s a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level , because 
these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation.  So , what that really means is, to get 
the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves 
all Americans, especially the people in the lower -income part o f the distribution, especially them.   
To do that , you’ ve got to have price stability.  A nd we ’ve got to get back to price stability so that 
we can have a labor market where people’ s wages aren ’t being eaten up by inflation and where 
we can have a long expa nsion, too.  That ’s—the  good things you can have, as we have.  W e’ve 
had—several of the longest expansions in U .S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that ’s 
May 4, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 24  
 because it ’s been a time of low inflation.   And long expansions are good for people and good for 
the labor market.  So that ’s the way I think about it.  I think we —you know, our tools work.  We 
have to think in the , in the medium and longer term.  And I do think that the best thing for 
everyone is for us to get back to price stability to suppor t, really , a sustained period of strong 
labor market conditions.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
June  15, 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  I will begin with one overarching message :  We at 
the Fed understand the hardship that high inflation  is causing .  We are strongly committed to 
bringing inflation back down, and we ’re moving expeditiously to do so.  We have both the tools 
we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families 
and businesses.  The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a  
half years and have proved resilient.  It is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have 
a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
From the standpoint of our c ongressional mandate to promote maximum employment and 
price stability, the current picture is plain to see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and 
inflation is much too high.  Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee 
raised its policy inter est rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that  
rate will be appropriate.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the 
size of our balance sheet.  I ’ll have more to say about today’s monetary polic y actions after 
briefly reviewing economic developments.  
Overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, as unusually sharp swings in 
inventories and net exports  more than offset continued strong underlying demand.  Recent 
indicators suggest tha t real GDP growth has picked up this quarter, with consumption spending 
remaining strong.  In contrast, growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing, and 
activity in the housing sector looks to be softening, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates.  The 
tightening in financial conditions that we ’ve seen in recent months should continue to temper 
growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply.  As shown in our Summary of 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 27  
 Economic Projections, FOMC participants have marked down their projections for economic 
activity, with the median projection for real GDP growth running below 2 percent through 2024. 
The labor market has remained extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 
50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and wage growth elevated.  Over the past three 
months, employment rose by an average of 408,000 jobs per month, down from the average pace seen earlier in the year but still robust.   Improvements in labor market conditions have been 
widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued, with the labor force participation rate little changed since January.  FOMC participants 
expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to co me into better balance, easing the 
upward pressures on wages and prices.  The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises somewhat over the next few years, moving from 3.7 percent at the end of this year to 
4.1 percent in 2024, levels that  are noticeably above the March projections.  
Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in April, total PCE prices rose 6. 3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core prices rose 4.9 perc ent.  In May, the 12- month change in the c onsumer price 
index came in above expectations at  8.6 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent .  
Aggregate demand is strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, and price pressures have spread to a broad range of goods and services.  The surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is  
boosting prices for gasoline and food and is  creating additional upward pressure  on inflation.  
And COVID- related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbat e supply chain disruptions.  
FOMC participants have revised up their projections for inflation this year, particularly for total 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 27  
 PCE inflation given developments in food and energy prices.  The median projection is 
5.2 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2024.  P articipants 
continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant  hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher 
costs of essentials like food, housing, and tra nsportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks 
high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective . 
Against the backdrop of the rapidly evolving economic environment, our policy has been 
adapting, and it will continue to do so.  At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¾ percentage point , resulting in a 1½ percentage point 
increase in the target range so far this year.  The Commi ttee reiterated that it anticipates that 
ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.  And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet —which plays an important role in firming the 
stance of monetary policy.  
Coming out of our last meeting in May, there was a broad sense on the Committee that a 
½ percentage point increase in the target range should be considered at this meeting if economic and financial conditions evolved in line with expectati ons.  We also stated that we were highly 
attentive to inflation risks and that we would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  Since then, inflation has again surprised to the upside, some indicators of inflation expectations h ave risen, and projections for inflation this year have been revised up 
notably.  In response to these developments, the Committee decided that a larger increase in the 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 27  
 target range was warranted at today’s meeting.  This continues our approach of expediti ously 
moving our policy rate up to more normal levels.  And it will help ensure that longer -term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.  
As shown in the SEP, t he median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds 
rate is 3.4 percent at the end of this year, 1.5 percentage point s higher than projected in March 
and 0.9 percentage point above the median estimate of its longer -run value .  The median 
projection rises further to 3.8 percent  at the end of next year and declines to 3.4 percent in 2024, 
still above the median longer -run value .  Of course, these projections do not represent a 
Committee plan  or decision, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a 
year or more from now.  
Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving 
down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent.  We anticipate that ongoing rate increases 
will be appropriate; the pace of those changes will continue to depend on the incoming data and 
the evolving outlook for the economy.  Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually 
large one , and I do not expect moves of this size to be common .  From the perspective of today, 
either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most like ly at our next meeting .  We 
will, however, make our decisions meeting by meeting, a nd we will continue to communicate 
our thinking as clearly as we can .  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation 
back down to our 2 percent goal  and to kee p longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  
Making appropriate monetary policy in this uncertain environment requires a recognition 
that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past ye ar, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be 
nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to avoid 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 5 of 27  
 adding uncertainty in  what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.  We are 
highly attentive to inflation risks  and determined to take the measures necessary to restore price 
stability.  The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary 
policy.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  And I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Two related 
questions .  Chair Powell , do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the 
last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July ?  And would you please give us as 
detailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly 
on Monday?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we 
can about our  policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, 
because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how 
policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function.  And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it ’s helpful 
to provide even more clarity than usual —again , subject to uncertainty in the outlook.  And I 
think over the course of this year , financial markets  have responded and have , generally, shown 
that they understand the path we ’re laying out.  Of course , it remains data dependent .  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 27  
 And so that ’s what we generally think about guidance , and that ’s why we offer it.  And , 
of course , when we offered that —when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that 
it was subject to the economy performing about i n line with expectations.  I also said that if the 
economy performed—if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even 
more ag gressively.  So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last 
week, and we thought for a while , and we thought , well , this is the appropriate thing to do.  So 
then the question is, what do you do?  And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting?  And I think the answer is , that ’s not where we are with this.  So we decided we needed to go 
ahead , and so we did.  And that ’s really —that ’s really how we made the decision.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Jeanna.  JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Jeanna Smialek with the New 
York Times.   You —I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you’re deciding 
how aggressive you need to be.  So , obviously, 75 today.  W hat did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn’ t 
have , and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Sure.  So if you take a step back, what we ’re looking for is 
compelling evidence that inflationary pressur es are abating and that inflation is moving back 
down.  A nd we ’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings —
that’s what we ’re looking for.  And , by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear 
signs of at least inflation flattening out and , ideally , beginning to decline.  We’ve said that we ’d 
be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks —the things tha t I 
mentioned to Howard moments ago.  
So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside .  Indicators —some 
indicators of inflation expectations have risen , and projections of [inflation] this year have 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 27  
 moved up notably.  So we thought that  strong action was warranted at this meeting , and today we 
delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike , as I mentioned.  So the point of it, really , 
is this :  We’ve been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels , and over the course of 
the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we ’ve seen financial 
conditions tighten, and appropriately so.  But the federal f unds r ate, even after this move, is at 
1.6 percent .  So, again , the Committee is moving rates up exped itiously to more normal levels , 
and we came to the view that we’ d like to do a little more front- end loading on that.  So I think 
that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time.  This 
was really about the speed in which we would get there.  So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points 
today—I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75.  T hat would 
put us , at the end of the July meeting , in that range —in that more normal range , and that ’s a 
desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with 
which you would proceed going forward. 
Just talking about the SEP for a second:   What it really says is that Committee 
participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted —restrictive level at the end 
of this year .  And that ’s six months from now , and so much data [can accrue] and so much can 
happen, s o remember how highly uncertain this is .  But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3 ½ 
percent.  Tha t’s where people are, and that ’s what they want to see, knowing what they know 
now and understanding that we need to be —we need to show resolve  but also be flexible [in 
responding] to incoming data as we see it.  If things are better, we don ’t need to do t hat much, 
and if they’ re not , then we either do that much or possibly even more.  But in any case, it will be 
very data dependent.  Then you’ re looking at next year , and what you’ re seeing is, people see 
more —a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3½ to 4 percent.  And that ’s generally what 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 27  
 people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and 
getting back down to 2 percent.  So  75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this 
meeting , and that ’s what we did.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Thank you for taking my question, Mr. 
Chairman.  You have not used the phrase in a long time “ monetary policy is in a good place,”  
which is a phrase that you used to use often.  Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a—or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is 
now, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that ’s a level that is going 
to be sufficie ntly high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem?  And just as a 
follow -up, could you break that apart for me?  How much of that is restrictive , and how much of 
that is a normal positive rate that ought to be e mbedded or not , in your opinion, in the funds rate? 
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So the question really is , how high does the rate really need to 
go?  And this is —the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3 ½ to 4 percent.  And how 
do you think about that?  Well, you can think about the longer -run neutral rate, you can compare 
it to that, and we think that ’s in the mid -2s.  You can look, frankly, at broader financial 
conditions.  You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they ’re having on the 
economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads—all of those things go into that.  You can also look 
at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate?  So for much of the yield curve now, real ra tes are positive.  That ’s not true at the short end .  At the short end of the 
yield curve in the early  years, you don’ t have real —you have negative rates still.  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 27  
 So that really is one data point —it’s  one part of financial conditions.  So I think—I have 
to look at it this way:   We move the policy rat e.  That affects financial conditions .  And that 
affects the economy.  We have , of course , ways —rigorous ways to think about it, but , ultimately , 
it comes down to , do we think financial conditions are in a place w here they ’re having the 
desired effect on the economy?  And that desired affect is , we’d like to see demand moderating.  
Demand is very hot still in the economy.  W e’d like to see the labor market getting better in 
balance between supply and demand , and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] 
both from supply and demand.  Right now , there ’s—demand is substantially higher than 
available supply , though, so we feel that there ’s a role for us in moderating demand.  Those are 
the things we can affect with our policy tools.  There are many things we can’ t affect, and those 
would be , you know, the things —the commodity price issues that we ’re having around the world 
due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the suppl y-side things that 
are still pushing upward on inflation.  So that ’s really how I think —how I think about it. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done?  Does it get the job done 
on breaking the back of inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think it ’s certainly in the range of plausible numbers.  I think we ’ll 
know when we get there really.  I mean , honestly,  though, that would be —you would have 
positive real rates , I think , and inflation coming down by then.  I think you’ d have positive real 
rates across the [yield] curve .  I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days.  So I would 
think it would, but you know what ?  We’re going to find that out empirically .  We’re not going 
to be completely model driven about thi s.  We’re going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes 
open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what ’s happening in the 
economy.  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 27  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thanks .  Nick Timiraos.  Chair Powell, you’ ve said that you like 
your policy to work through expectations .  And now , obviously, this decision was something 
quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during 
the intermeeting period.  And I know you just said that wha t changed was really the inflation 
data—the inflation expectations data .  But I’m wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was 
there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing somethi ng so different from what you had “socialized ” before?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations —so you’ ve 
got the public, you’ ve got surveys of the public and of experts , and you’ ve also got market based.  
And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short -term inflation is going to be high but comes 
down sharply over the next couple  of years.  And that ’s really where inflation expectations are.  
And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent.  And so this 
is really very important to us —that that remain  the case.  And I think if you look for most 
measures, most of the time, that ’s what you see.  If we even see a couple of indicators that bring 
that into question, we take that very seriously.  We do not take this for granted—we take it very seriously.  So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading—it ’s a preliminary reading ; it might be 
revised —nonetheless, it was quite eye- catching, and we noticed that.  We also noticed that the 
index of c ommon i nflation e xpectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a 
long time, so we ’re watching t hat, and we ’re thinking, “t his is something we need to take 
seriously.”   And that is one of the factors , as I mentioned—o ne of the factors in our deciding to 
move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations.  We ’re 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 27  
 absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent.  That was one of the reasons —the 
other was just the CPI r eading.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick- up in 
inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next 
meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ re going to —I’ll just say , we’re going to react to the incoming 
data and appropriate ly, I think.  So I wouldn’ t want to put a number on what that might be.  The 
main thing is to get rates  up, and then pretty soon, we ’ll be in an area where we’ re—I think as 
you get closer to the end of the year, you’ re in a range where you’ ve got restrictive policy, which 
is appropriate .  Forty- year highs in inflation —we think th at policy is going to need t o be 
restrictive, and we don’ t know how restrictive.  So I think that ’s how we ’ll take it.  
MICHELLE SMITH. Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios .  Thanks for taking our 
questions.  The late -breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points —do you worry that that 
will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future ?  And should we think of that as a 
kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor market starts to roll o ver?  
CHAIR POWELL.  To take your second question first, yes .  I mean , I think we ’re—
again, we ’re going, we ’re resolved to take this on , but we ’re going to be flexible in the 
implementation of it.  Sorry —and your [first] question was [about] guidance.  So,  again, the 
overall exercise is that we try to be —provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we 
can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better.  There’ s always a trade off, 
because you have to live with that guidance , and so you do it,  and it helps a lot of the time.  I , 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 27  
 frankly , think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work.  With us having really 
just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite 
significantly through the expectations channel, as we ’ve made it clear what our plans are.  So I 
think that ’s been a very healthy thing to be happening.  A nd I would hope that our —it’s always 
going to be —any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things w orking out 
about as we expect.  And , in this particular situation, you know, we ’re looking for something 
specific, and that is progress on inflation.  We want to see progress.  W e want to see —inflation 
can’t go down until it flattens out , and that ’s what we ’re looking to see.  And if we don’ t see that, 
then that ’s the kind of thing that will —even if we don’ t see progress for a longer period, that 
could cause us to react.  But we will .  Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some 
point.  And w e’ll react [as] appropriate to that , too.  But I would like to think, though , that our 
guidance is still credible , but it ’s always going to be conditional on what happens.  This is an 
unusual situation, to get , you know, some data late in , during blackout, pretty close to —very 
close to our meeting.  Very unusual to [have] one  that would actually change the outcome .  So 
I’ve only seen—in my 10 -years -plus here at the Fed, I’ve only seen something like that, even 
close to that, one or two times.  So I don’ t think it’ s something that ’ll come up a great deal.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  Colby Smith with the 
Financial Times.  On the “ clear and convincing”  threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the 
level of realized inflation that meets that criteria ?  And how is the Committee thinking about the 
potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what ’s forecasted in the SEP if 
inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The second par t I didn’t get.  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 27  
 COLBY SMITH.  W hat’s the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even 
what ’s forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating a t an acceptable pace?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right .  So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly 
readings for inflation, and we ’d like to see inflation headed down.  B ut, you know —and right 
now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right?   So, soon enough, we ’ll have our policy rate —
let’s assume the world works out about like  the SEP says:  T he policy rate will be up where we 
think it should be .  And then the question would be :  Do you slow dow n?  Does it make you —
you’ll be making these judgments about , is it appropriate now to slow down—from 50 to 25, 
let’s say —or speed up?   So that ’s the kind of thinking we ’ll be doing, and , again, we ’re 
looking—ultimately , we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see 
convincing evidence, compelling ev idence , that inflation is coming down.  A nd that ’s what I 
mean by—that ’s what it would take for us to say, “O kay, we think this job is done.”   Because we 
saw—and, frankly, we saw last year —inflation came down over the course of the summer and 
then turned  right around and went back up.  So I think we ’re going to be careful about declaring 
victory.  But our —again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and s ensitive to 
incoming data.  
COLBY SMITH.  Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it’ s going to 
require more than just some pain at this point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Again, I think that —I do think that our objective , and this is what ’s 
reflected in the SEP, but our objective , really , is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the 
labor market remains strong.  I think that what ’s becoming more clear is that many factors that 
we don’ t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that ’s possible or 
not.  And there I ’m thinking , of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 27  
 [developments] , things like that , where we really —the monetary polic y stance doesn ’t affect 
those things .  But having said that, there is a path for us to get there —it’s not getting easier ; it’s 
getting more challenging because of these external forces—and that path is to move demand 
down, and you have a lot of surplus demand.  T ake, for example , in the labor market.  So you 
have two job vacancies,  essentially , for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a 
real imbalance in wage negotiating.  You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more 
normal level , and you wouldn’ t—you would expect to see those wage pressures move back 
down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’ s consistent with 2 percent infla tion.  So that ’s a possibility .  And you could say the 
same thing about some of the product markets where there ’s just excess capacity and really 
where the strong demand has gone into—sorry , where they ’re capacity constrained, right?  So 
you have , effectiv ely, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it .  So demand 
comes in , and it’s very strong , and it shows up in higher prices —not  higher quantities, not more 
cars, because they can ’t make the cars because they don ’t have the semiconductors.  So in 
principle , that could work in reverse .  When demand comes down, you could see —and it ’s not 
guaranteed —but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships 
that you see in the textbooks would suggest , because of the unusual situation we ’re in on the 
supply side.  So there ’s a pathway there.  It is not going to be easy, and there —again , it’s our 
objective , but, as I mentioned, it ’s going to depend to some extent on factors we don’ t control.  
MICHELLE SMI TH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.   Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking our questions.  Rachel 
Siegel from the Washington Post.  So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking 
up through 2024.  I s a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to co mbat inflation?  And 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 27  
 what is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control 
inflation?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So  you’ re right .  In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 
4 point —the me dian is 4.1  percent —of course , [there is] a range  of actual forecasts.  And I 
would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know , on its way down to 2 
percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that ’s still a historically low level.   
We hadn ’t seen —we hadn’t seen  rates, unemployment rates below 4  percent until a couple years 
ago for —we ’d seen it for , like , one year in the last 50.  So the idea that —3.6 percent is 
historically low in the last century.  So a 4.1 percent unemployment ra te with inflation well on its 
way to 2 percent —I think that would be —I think that would be a successful outcome.  So we ’re 
not looking to have a higher unemployment rate .  But I would say that I would certainly look at 
that as a successful outcome.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Would that include people losing their jobs?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ re not —again, we ’re not, we don’ t seek to put people out of 
work, of course .  We never think , “Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have 
jobs.”  But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without 
price stability.  And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market , and that ’s a labor market where workers are getting wage increases— maybe the 
workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were 
before the pandemic —where participation is high, where there ’s lots of job opportunities, where 
it’s just a really —I mean , the labor market we  had before the pandemic was—that ’s what we 
want to get back to.  And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows.  We’ d love 
to get back to that place.  But, to get there —it’s not going to happen with the levels of inflation 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 27  
 we have.  So w e have to restore that , and it really is in service , in the medium and longer term , of 
the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Matt.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg.  So , as 
you just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a ½ percentage point rise in the 
unemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years , and it removed a line from its 
policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens pol icy.  
You just mentioned that that is still your objective , though, so I ’m wondering if you could 
explain why that line was removed from the statement—also whether this means the F OMC is 
trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down. 
CHAIR POWEL L.  Not trying to induce a recession now.  Let ’s be clear about that.  
We’re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market.  That ’s what 
we’re trying to do.  So let me talk about that sentence.  Clearly , it’s our goal to bring about 
2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right?  And that ’s kind of what the 
SEP says .  The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with 
unemployment at 4.1 percent.  A nd this is a strong labor market—this is a good labor market. 
And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it.  But those pathways have become much more 
challenging due to factors that are not under our control.  Again, thinking here of the fallout from 
the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer , industrial 
chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer  
lasting than anticipated.  So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy , effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong 
labor market.  And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy.  I t just didn ’t—the 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 27  
 sentence isn ’t—it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this.  And that ’s 
not—that just didn ’t seem appropriate , so we took the sentence out.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.  And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, 
could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against , say, a month 
ago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply- side 
issues get worked out?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , yeah, I think you’ ve seen —ag ain, we ’ve been expecting 
progress , and we didn’ t get that.  W e got sort of the opposite .  So I also think the situation, 
really —since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you ’re 
seeing is the situation getting more difficul t.  And you look around the world—I mean , lots of 
countries are —lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it ’s largely due to 
commodities prices.  But all over the world , you’ re seeing these e ffects.  And so—and we ’re 
seeing them here:  g as prices at  all-time highs , and things like that .  That’s not something we can 
do something about.  So that is really —and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is 
important for expectations.  People —the public ’s expectations, why would they be 
distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation?   Core inflation is something we [on 
the Committee] think a bout because it is a better predictor of future inflation.  But headline 
inflation is what people experience .  They don’ t know what core is.  Why would they?  They 
have no reason to.  So that ’s—expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflat ion.  
So it’s become—the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five 
months , and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today.  Hence our resolution to 
get rates up and, ultimately , get them to where we think they need to be in coming months.  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 27  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks , Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.  
I want ed to ask you—you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that  retail sales surprised the 
market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down.  Are you hearing from 
contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re, of course , watching very, very carefully for that and 
looking at the retail— the big store numbers and all that  kind of thing.  A nd so I —but I think the 
fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting—sales going down, but overall spending is very strong.  The consumer ’s in really good 
shape financial ly.  T hey’re spending.  There ’s no sign of a broader  slowdown that I can see in the 
economy.  People are talking about it a lot —consumer confidence is very low.  That ’s probably 
related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.  But that’ s what  
we’re seeing.  We’ re not seeing a broad slowdown.  We see job growth slowing, but it ’s still at 
quite robust levels.  We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels —healthy growth 
levels.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   So then as you are raising rates in thi s economy, how closely 
are you watching consumer spending, or is there something —another indicator that you ’re 
watching more closely?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It would be hard to watch  anything much more closely than we 
watch consumer spending, but we watch everythi ng.  We watch business fixed investment, 
which actually has softened a bit .  And we watch —we ’re responsible for watching everything .  
Consumption is 60- some percent of the economy, two -thirds  of the economy, so, naturally , we 
spend a lot of time on that.  And , again, there ’s a lot going on —there are a lot of flows back and 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

 forth —but , ultimately , it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well  
positioned to deal with higher interest rates.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   Michael McKee from Bloomberg 
Radio and Television.  Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation?  In other 
words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up?  If that ’s going to be the 
component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate 
is holding steady or starting to go down?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the —we ’re responsible for inflation in the law.  And inflation 
means headline i nflation.  So that ’s our ultimate goal.  We, of course, like all central b anks do, 
look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is —it’s a much better predictor , and it ’s 
much—it ’s a much better predictor of where inflation is going , and it ’s also  more relevant to our 
tools.  As I mentioned, the parts that don’ t go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tool s, 
so we look at that.  But it ’s—the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I 
mentioned about expectations .  We can ’t affect, really —I mean , the energy prices are set by 
global commodity prices .  And most of food—not all of it, but most food prices are pretty 
heavily influenced by global commodity prices , too.  Also other things.  So we can ’t really have 
much of an effect .  But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations 
[coming] from headline  [inflation readings] .  So it’ s a very difficult situation to be in , and we —
again, we can ’t do much about the difference between [h eadline and core inflation rates due to] 
the elements that make up headline that are not in core.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Could I just, as a follow -up, get a clarification on the SEP ?  When 
the members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record ?  Were they revised 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 27  
 after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out?  In other words, does the SEP , as we have it now , 
reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The SEP is of one piece .  It reflects all of the economic  readings .  It 
also reflects the 75 basis point increase.  This is important.  So people had that in hand when 
they—when their SEPs were submitted.  So it ’s—in other words, it ’s not in addition to what ’s in 
the SEP.  T he SEP—everyone ’s SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what’ s 
going forward. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Victoria Guida from Politico.  I wanted to ask about how 
you’re measuring progress, especially since you’ ve now started front -loading rate hik es more.  
You’ve talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports , and I 
guess I ’m curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you 
might be concerned that it ’s a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that , 
as you’ ve talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects .  And I guess my question is, 
do you think that inflation will tell you —inflation data will tell you when you’ ve gone to where 
you need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it ’s better to overshoot than to undershoot?  
 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think the role that we can play—maybe the way to get at this is 
to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right?  A nd we ’ll be able to see—th e 
areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand , and we ’ll be able to see our 
effect on , for example, job openings in real  time.  And that would tell us what ’s—that would tell 
us about wages.  Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we ’re seeing , but, 
going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector .  Sorry, I ’m not 
sure I ’m getting to your question.  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 27  
 VICTORIA GUIDA.  My question is, is inflation data itself the best ind icator for when 
you’re getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far?  
CHAIR POWELL.  There ’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and 
it’s going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not —maybe it ’ll be really clear .  But 
we’re—and we ’re quite mindful of the dangers.  But I will say , the worst mistake we could make 
would be to fail, which —it’ s not an option.  We have to restore price stability .  We really do, 
because everything —it’s the bedrock of the economy.  If you don’ t have price stability, the 
economy’ s really not going to work the way it ’s supposed to.  It won ’t work for people —their 
wages will be eaten up.  So we want to get the job done.  This inflation happened relatively 
recently .  We don’ t think that it’ s affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way.  We 
don’t think that we ’re seeing a wage –price spiral.  We think that the public generally sees us as 
very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent , and that ’s critical.  It ’s 
absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence.  So that ’s how we ’re thinking 
about it.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance.  I just want to expand, I 
guess , on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done.  
You talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession 
just broadly being dinner table talk.  Does the general feel among American households and also 
businesses square with your e xplanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in 
the statement didn ’t change between May and June?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, clearly , people don’ t like inflation —a lot.  And many people are 
experiencing it , really , for the first time , because we haven ’t had anything like this kind of 
inflation in 40 years .  And it’s really something people don’ t like .  And they’ re experiencing that , 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 27  
 and that ’s showing up in their —in surveys and in all kinds of ways.  And we understa nd that , and 
we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we ’re 
determined to do what we can to get inflation back down.  So that ’s really what we ’re saying.  
We’re not —I’m not —clearly , it’s an incredibly unpopular thing, and it ’s very painful for people.  
I guess what I ’m saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing 
our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use 
them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time.  It will take some time , we think, 
to get inflation back down, but we will do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  You have 
talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns .  But aside from 
rises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we’ re also seeing stickier measures of inflation 
increasing , such as the Cleveland Fed ’s median and trimmed  mean CPIs.  I mean , how persistent 
do you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to—where do you see those going in the near future ? 
CHAIR POWELL.   So, as I mentioned , I think , in my opening statement, inflation has 
started —it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic -related areas , and it ’s spread now 
broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well .  It was really in the  goods  sector 
at the beginning.  And , particularly , you’re seeing in travel now, if you’ ve flown on a pl ane 
lately —planes are very full , and plane tickets are very expensive.  S ome of that will be pass-
through of  energy prices , but it ’s—so you’ re experiencing services inflation.  Shelter inflation is 
high.  S o the question— and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other 
measures are going up.  So it’s a time when we’ re not seeing progress and we want to see 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 27  
 progress , and that ’s really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks 
like it does .  We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would 
be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3½ percent by year -end.  
And then after that , you see what the rest of the SEP says.  So I hope that ’s responsive t o your 
question.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Nancy. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer  with 
Marketplace.  Do you still think a softish landing is possible , and how would you define that at 
this point considering the revised projections f or unemployment, GDP, inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I think what ’s in the SEP would certainly meet that test.  If you 
see—you’ re looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the 
unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent .  That would be —I would call that as meeting 
that test.  Do I still think that we can do that?  I do.  I think there ’s—I think there ’s—I don’ t want 
to be the handicapper here .  I just— that is our objective , and I do think it ’s possible.  Like I said , 
though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created 
great challenges.  A nd, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it —there ’s a much 
bigger chance now that it ’ll depend on factors that we don’ t cont rol, which is , fluctuations and 
spikes in  commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.  So we just don’ t 
know, but we ’re focused on —very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, 
which we think is essential for the b enefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a 
sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg.  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 24 of 27  
 GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chair Powell, I was 
wondering if you could talk a little bit more —economists are worried that you ’re kind of hitting 
the economy with a sledgehammer and that now there ’s even more risk of a recession than a   
50–50 path of rates.  So could you talk a little bit more about that ?  And what evidence would get 
you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over 
the last seven months, and that ’s a good thing, we think.  But the f ederal f unds r ate, even after 
this increase , is at 1.6 percent.  So it ’s hard to see how that is too high of a rate .  And even if we 
did another —so we ’re going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s 
probably.  Still, that’ s still a low rate.  So that ’s not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession 
on.  And we ’ll—by then,  we’ll have seen a whole lot more data.  As I mentioned a couple times, 
the Committee ’s views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 
3½ percent range by the end of this yea r, but that ’s conditioned on that being the appropriate 
thing to do.  If we see data going in a different direction, it ’ll be reflected in our policy , as you 
see today.  We’ll be watching— if things go in a direction we don’ t expect, then we’ re going to 
adapt.  And I would say,  this is a highly uncertain environment —extraordinarily uncertain 
environment.  So, again, we ’ll be determined and resolved, but flexible.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Okay.  Evan. 
EVAN RYSER.  Evan Ryser, Market News International .  Thank you, Chair Powell.  I 
was wondering if the F ed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last 
two years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public?  And then, secondly, 
given the illiquidity and the extraordinar y volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that 
QT will make that worse?  
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 25 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry, what was your question on QT?  
EVAN RYSER.  Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial 
markets, whether QT will make things wo rse. 
CHAIR POWELL.   So, of course , we’ve been looking very carefully and hard at why 
inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent.  We—
it’s hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question mornin g, noon, and night.  
But you have to understand the context .  For—really , the context is this :  For decades before the 
pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let ’s call it that, globalization 
enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity.  So and that ’s how all the models work is , 
decades and decades of data—they look at that .  It’s a very flat Philips curve wor ld, and the 
supply shocks tend to be transient , right ?  So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of 
shocks , if you think about it :  the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by 
the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China —the war in Ukraine potentially having 
effects for years here.  So we ’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy —we 
have been , obviously, for quite a while .  But this is a different —these forces  are different.  
Inflation is behaving dif ferently , and,  in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong 
demand.  B ut you couldn ’t get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which 
is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that.  So that ’s how we ’re looking at it.  
And we ’ve done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about , what all that means.  
You don’ t—the thing is , you don’ t know whether those forces are—to what extent are they going 
to be sustained ?  In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 26 of 27  
 old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on?   The 
history is , you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the ’ 70s, and then they go away, 
and sort of there ’s a “new normal ,” and things settle down.  But , honestly, we don’ t know what 
that’s going to be.  In the meantime , we have to find price stability in this new world and 
maximum employment in this new world where , clearly , inflationary forces are —you ’re seeing 
them everywhere.  Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it ’s 
absolutely extraordi nary.  It’ s not just here.  In fact, we ’re sort of in the middle of the pack, 
although I think we have , of course , a different kind of inflation than other people have , partly 
because our economy is stronger and more highly recover ed.  So that ’s what we ’re doing.  
We’ve done a lot of introspection and work on that and—sorry, on QT, we ’ve communicated 
really clearly to the markets about what we’ re going to do there.  Markets seem to be okay with 
it.  We ’re phasing in—Treasury [security] issuance is down quit e a lot, quite a lot from where 
it’s been, so I have no reason to think—markets are forward looking , and they see this coming.  I 
have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems .  It seems to be kind of understood 
and accepted at this poin t. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks .  For the last question, we ’ll go to Mark Hamrick.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  I wonder what your 
assessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years -long increase in home 
prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates.  And all that , of course, given the heightened 
sensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial 
crisis over a decade ago.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So rates were very low —a good place to start is that rates were 
very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could 
June 15, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 27 of 27  
 to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unempl oyment rate 
was well higher than that.  A nd that was a —rates a re low , and now they’ re coming back up to 
more normal , or above , levels.  So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while  demand was 
really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wa nting to live in urban areas to some 
extent to living in single -family homes in the suburbs, famously.  A nd so the demand was just 
suddenly much higher.  And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of 
years.  So that changes now , and rates have moved up—we ’re well aware that mortgage rates 
have moved up a lot —and you’ re seeing a changing housing market.  We ’re watching it to see 
what will happen.  How much will it really affect residential investment?  Not really sure.  How 
much will  it affect housing prices?  Not really sure .  It’s—I mean, obviously, we ’re watching 
that quite carefully.  You would think over time —I mean , so there ’s a tremendous amount of 
supply in the housing market of unfinished homes , and as those come on  line—whereas the 
supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale , is incredibly low, 
historically low.  So it ’s still a very tight market.  So prices may keep going up for a while even 
in a world where rates ar e up.  S o it’s a complicated situation.  We watch it very carefully.   I 
would say if you’ re a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need 
a bit of a reset.  We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and 
where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again.  S o this will be a process 
whereby we —ideally , we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place 
and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriat e levels.  
So thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
July 27, 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to 
bringing inflation back down, and we ’re moving expeditiously to do so.  We have both the tools 
we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and 
businesses.  
The economy and the country have been through a lot over the past two and a  half years 
and have proved resilient.  It is essential that we bring inf lation down to our 2 percent goal if we 
are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.   
From the standpoint of our c ongressional mandate to promote maximum employment and 
price stability, the current picture is plain to  see:  The labor market is extremely tight, and 
inflation is much too high.  Against this backdrop, today the F OMC raised its policy interest rate 
by ¾ of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds r ate will be appropriate.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly 
reducing the size of our balance sheet .  And I’ll have more to say about today’s monetary policy 
actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.   
Recent indicator s of spending and production have softened.  Growth in consumer 
spending has slowed significantly, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions.  Activity in the housing sector has weakened, in part reflecting higher mortgage rates.  And after a strong increase in the first quarter, business fixed investment also 
looks to have declined in the second quarter.     
Despite these developments, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate near a 50- year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth 
elevated.  Over the past three months, employment rose by an average of 375,000 jobs per 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 29  
 month—down from the average pace seen earlier in the year , but still robust.  Improvements in 
labor market conditions have been widespread, including for workers at the lower end of the 
wage distribution as well as for African Americans and Hispanics.  Labor demand is very strong, while labor supply remains subdued,  with the labor force participation rate little changed since 
January.  Overall, the continued strength of the labor market suggests that underlying aggregate demand remains solid.  
Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in May, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.7 percent.  In June, the 12 -month change in the consumer 
price index came in above expectations at 9.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 
5.9 percent.  Notwi thstanding the recent slowdown in overall economic activity, aggregate 
demand appears to remain strong, supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than 
anticipated, and price pressures are evident across a broad range of goods and services.  
Although prices for some commodities have turned down recently, the earlier surge in prices of 
crude oil and other commodities that resulted from Russia’s war on Ukraine has boosted prices 
for gasoline and food, creating additional upward pressure on inflati on.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least abl e to meet the higher 
costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.   
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 29  
 At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
¾ of a percentage point, bringing the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent.  And we ’re continuing 
the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which p lays an important role 
in firming the stance of monetary policy.  
Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving 
down, consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent.  We anticipate that ongoing increases in 
the ta rget range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will 
continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy.  Today’s 
increase is the —in the target range is the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings.  
While another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting, that is a decision that will depend on the data we get between now and then.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicatin g—and communicate our thinking as clearly 
as possible.  As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate 
to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are 
affecting the economy and i nflation.  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring demand 
into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  
Making appropriate monetary policy  in this uncertain environment requires a recognition 
that the economy often involves —evolves in unexpected ways.  Inflation has obviously surprised 
to the upside over the past year, and further surprises could be in store.  We therefore will need to be ni mble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  And we will strive to 
avoid adding uncertainty in what is already an extraordinarily challenging and uncertain time.  We are highly attentive to inflation risks and determined to take the measu res necessary to return 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 29  
 inflation to our 2 percent longer -run goal.  This process is likely to involve a period of below -
trend economic growth and some softening in labor market conditions .  But such outcomes are 
likely necessary to restore price stability  and to set the stage for achieving maximum 
employment and stable prices over the longer  run.   
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public miss ion.  We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s start with Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Ch air Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel 
from the Washington Post.  I ’m wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the 
decision not to go for a full percentage point increase .  We saw a ramp -up after the May CPI 
report came in hotter than usual a nd then, obviously, the June figure did, too.  Was there any 
discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting?  Yes.  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right 
magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that 
we’ve been making.  I’d say that we wouldn’ t hesitate to , to make an even larger move than we 
did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was— that that were appropriate.  That was 
not the case at this meeting.  There was very broad support for the move that we made.  
You mentioned the —the  June meeting.  We, we  had said many times that we were 
prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disapp oint.  And 
that’s why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting , as we said we would do.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 29  
 At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace , as inflation has continued to 
disappoint , in the form of the June CPI reading.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. 
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you so much for taking our questions.  Colby Smith with t he 
Financial Times.  As the C ommittee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the 
expected decline in headline inflation , which might come as a result o f the drop in commodity 
prices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular?   
And given that potential tension and signs of , you know, any kind of activity weakening here, 
how has the Committee ’s thinking cha nged on how far into restrictive territory rates might  need 
to go?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I ’d start by saying we ’ve been saying we would move 
expeditiously to get to the range of neutral.  And I think we ’ve done that now .  We’re at —we’re  
at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that ’s right in the range of what we think is neutral.  So the question 
is, how are we thinking about the path forward ?  So one thing that hasn’ t changed is that —won ’t 
change —is that our focus is continuing to—is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring 
demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down.  That ’ll 
continue to be our overarching focus.  
We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we ’ll make 
decisions meeting by meeting.  So what are we going to be looking at?  You know, w e’ll be 
looking at the incoming data , as I mentioned, and that ’ll start with economic activity.  Are we 
seeing the slowdown that we —the slowdown in economic act ivity—that we think we need?  And 
there ’s some evidence that we are at this time.  Of course, we ’ll be looking at labor market 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 29  
 conditions.  And we ’ll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand 
getting better, getting closer.   
Of cour se, we’ ll be looking closely at inflation.  You mentioned headline and core.  Our 
mandate is for headline, of course ; it’s not for core.  But we look at core because core is, is  
actually a better indicator of headline a nd of all inflation going forward.  So we ’ll be—we’ll be  
looking at both.  And we ’ll be looking at them for —at those both, really —for what they’ re 
saying about  the outlook rather than just simply for , for what they say.  But we ’ll be asking:  D o 
we see inflationary pressures declining?  Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down?  
So, in light of all that data, the question we ’ll be asking is whether the stance of policy we 
have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent  target.  And it ’s also 
worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they ’ve come —they’ve come  quickly.  
And it ’s likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy.  So there ’s probably some 
additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeli ne.  
So where are we going with this?  I think the best —I think the C ommittee broadly feels 
that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level.  And maybe the best data  
point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the —at t he June meeting .  So I think 
the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would ’ve been between 3¼ 
and 3½ [percent] .  And , then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023.  So 
that’s—even though that ’s now six week s old, I guess, that ’s—that’s  the most recent reading.  Of 
course, we ’ll update that reading at the —at the  September meeting in eight weeks.  So that ’s how 
we’re thinking about it.  
As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase 
could be appropriate, but that ’s not a decision we ’re making now.  It’ s one that we ’ll make based 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 29  
 on the data we see.  And we ’re going to be making decisions meeting by meeting.  We think 
it’s—we think it’s  time to just go to a meeting -by-meeting basis and not provide , you know, the 
kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to  neutral.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of t he Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, you ’ve said 
that your policy works through influencing expectations and th at policy needs to be at least 
moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight.  Futures market 
pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then lower them a few months later next year.  Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’m go ing to start by pointing out that it ’s very hard to say with 
any confidence in normal times —in normal times —what the economy’ s going to be doing in 
6 or 12 months.  And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond—response would be —of course, we do that in the SEP, but , nonetheless, you’ ve got to take any 
estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt , because there ’s so much 
uncertainty.  
These are not normal times.  There ’s significantly more uncertainty now about t he path 
ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily , it’s quite high.  So, again, I would—the 
best data, the only data  point I have for you really is the June SEP , which I think is just the most 
recent thing that the C ommittee ’s done.  Since then, inflation has come in higher ; economic 
activity has come in weaker than expected.   
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 29  
 But at the same time, I would say that ’s probably the best estimate of where the 
Committe e’s thinking is still, w hich is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the 
end of this year —by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3½ percent —and that when the 
Committee sees further rate increases in 2023 , as I mentioned, we ’ll update tha t, of course , at the 
September meeting.  But that ’s really the best I can do on that.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated.  Has 
your view of the terminal rate changed since June?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I wouldn’ t say it was—I think we didn’ t expect a good reading, 
but this one —this one  was even worse than expected, I would say.  I don ’t talk about my own 
personal estimate of , of what the terminal rate would be.  I  do—I will write down that in —it’s 
going to evolve.  Obviously, it has evolved over the course —I think , for all participants, it has 
evolved over the course of the year a s we learn how persistent inflation ’s going to be.  
And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and 
two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity 
and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows.  It’ ll be—it’ll be  a lot.  It’s an eight -week 
intermeeting period , so I think we ’ll see quite a lot of data.  And we ’ll make our decision at that 
meeting based on that data.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Jeanna 
Smialek, New York Times.   You kind of alluded to this earlie r, but I wonder in the event that you 
see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down 
so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that . 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s hard to deal with hypotheticals , but I just would say this.  We, 
you know, we  would look at both, and we would ask—we ’d be asking ourselves , are we 
confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent ?  That ’s really the question.  And we ’ll be 
making—you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident 
that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent .  So you would—it would depend on a lot 
of things.  
Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a bett er predictor of inflation going forward .  
Headline inflation tends to be volatile.  So , in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile 
moves in  commodities.  The problem with the current situation is that, that  if you have a 
sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations.  The public doesn’ t distinguish between core and headline 
inflation in their thinking.  So it ’s something we have to take into consideration in our 
policymaking even though our tools don’ t really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the 
supply- side issues.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thanks for taking my question, Mr. 
Chairman.  Earlier this week, the P resident said , “We are not going to be in a recession.” So I 
have two questions off of that.  Do you share the President ’s confidence in not being in a 
recession ?  And, second, how would or would not a recession change polic y?  Is it a bright line, 
sir, where , where  contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy?  Or is  there 
some amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort 
to reduce inflation?  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So, as I —as I  mentioned, we think it ’s necessary to have growth 
slow  down.  And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons , one of 
which is that you’ re coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021.  You ’re 
also seeing tighter monetary policy.  And you should see some slowing.  
We actually think we need a period of growth below potential  in order to create some 
slack so that —so that  the supply side can catch up.  We also think that there will be, in all 
likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions.  And those are things that we expect .  And 
we think that they ’re probably necessary if we were to have— to get inflation —if we were to be 
able to get inflation back down on a  path to 2 percent  and ultimately get there.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that 
might or might not change policy.  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re going to be —again, we ’re going to be focused on getting 
inflation back down.  And  we—as I ’ve said on other occasions, price stability is really the 
bedrock of the economy.  And nothing works in the economy without price stability.  We can ’t 
have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time.  
We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic , where 
differences between , you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at 
historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low.  We want to get back 
to that , but that ’s not happening.  That ’s not going to happen without , without  restoring price 
stability.  So that ’s something we see as, as  something that we simply must do.  And we think 
that in the —we don’ t see it as a tradeoff with , with  the empl oyment mandate.  We see it as a way 
to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 29  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Particularly in regard to 
expectations, it ’s been said th e last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the 
lists—the risks of doing too much.  Does that remain the bias?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re trying to do just the right amount, right?  We ’re not —we’re 
not trying to have a recession.  And we don’ t think we have to.  We think that there ’s a path for 
us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market , as I mentioned , 
along with —in all likelihood —some , some  softening in labor market conditions.  So that is —
that’s what we ’re trying to achieve , and we continue to think that there ’s a path to that.  We 
know that the path has , has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our 
control.  And it may narrow further.  
So, you know , I do think —as I said ju st now —that restoring price stability is just 
something that we have to do.  There , there  isn’t an option to fail to do that because that is the 
thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time.  Without restoring price stability, 
you won’ t be able, over the me dium  and longer term, to actually have a  strong—a  sustained 
period of very strong labor market conditions.  So, of course , we serve both sides of the dual 
mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  But a s a—as a follow -on to that, given the uncertainty and 
that sort of paradoxical flow of data you ’ve been getting, if you’ re going to make a mistake, 
would you rather make the mistake on doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little?  
CHAIR POWE LL.  We’ re trying not to make a mistake.  Let me put it this way :  We do 
see that there are two -sided risks.  There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, 
imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk —the ris k of 
doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost.  If 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 29  
 you fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of  dealing with it later t o the 
extent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives.   
They start to factor high inflation into their decisions —when that —on a sustained basis.  
When that starts to really happen, and we don’ t think that ’s happened yet, but when that starts to 
happen, it just gets that much harder.  And  the pain will be that much greater.  So I really do 
think that it’ s important that we —that we  address this now and get it done.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios.  To build a little  bit on 
what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession?  Will the 
GDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other?  And has your assessment of 
the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I don’t —I do not think the  U.S. is currently in a recession.  And 
the reason is , there are just too many areas of the economy that are—that are  performing, you 
know, too well.  And , of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular.  As I me ntioned, 
it’s true that growth is slowing f or reasons that we understand.  Really , the growth was 
extraordinarily high last year, 5 ½ percent.  We would have expected growth to slow.  There ’s 
also more slowing going on now.  
But if you look at the labor market, you ’ve got growth—I think, payroll jobs averaging  
450,000 per month.  That ’s a remarkably strong level for , for this state of , of affairs .  The 
unemployment rate at near a 50 -year low at 3.6 percent .  All of the wage measures that we track 
are running very strong.  So this is a very strong labor market, and it ’s just not consistent with —
you know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year .  It doesn ’t make sense that the 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 29  
 economy would be in recession with , with  this kind of thing happening.  So I don’ t think the U .S. 
economy’ s in recession right now.  
NEIL IRWIN.  GDP?  GDP tomorrow?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Ah, haven’ t seen it , and, and  we’ll just have to see what it says.  I 
don’t —I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP  numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty 
significantly.  It’ s just —it’s just that it’ s very hard —it’s very hard  to cumulate  [to an estimate of] 
U.S. GDP .  It’s a large economy.  And a lot of —a lot of  work and judgment goes into that.  But 
you tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a —with a  grain of salt.  But , of course, it ’s 
something we ’ll be looking at.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask 
about the new conflict- of-interest rules that you all rolled out.  Some s enators have written 
asking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed’s 
financial— the Fed officials’ financial activity.  I was wondering if you could speak to that and 
whether you intend on, you know, toughening those rules in any way.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So those are —those are the toughest rules in place , you know, at any 
comparable institution that I’ m aware of.  We think —you know, we ’ve thought about this 
carefully, and we put them in place.  And we ’re building the infrastructure so that—so that, you 
know, the enforcement will be tight,  that,  actually , you won’ t be able to make trades unless 
they’ re precleared.  And the amount of trades you make, they’ ll have to be 45 days or more 
before any F OMC meeting.  It’s just —I think we ’ve really , you know, created a very strong and 
robust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution.  And , again, we ’re 
just now —the sys tem is just now up and running.  And I ’m proud of what we did.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 29  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Catarina.  
CATARINA SARAIVA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Hi.  Catarina Sarai va, Bloomberg News.  I 
wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25.  Can y ou talk a little 
bit about what , what  kind of goes into your thinking for , you know, making the decision on how 
much to raise rates a nd, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to?   
Could that possibly be 100 basis points?  And th en, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of 
weakness in the economy , outside of inflation measures , that would lead you to slow your 
hiking pace?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’m going to —I’m going to  take that as a question about the next 
meeting and thereafter.  So, as I mentioned, we ’re going to be looking at all of those things :  
activity, labor market, inflation.  And we ’re going to be thinking about our policy stance and 
where does it really need  to be .  And I also mentioned that , as this process —now that we ’re at 
neutral —as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to  slow down.  And we 
haven’ t made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right?  We ’ve been 
front -end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we ’re getting closer to where we need 
to be.  So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it.  
And i n terms of September, we ’re going—we’re going to watch the data and the evolving 
outlook very caref ully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to 
do.  And I ’m not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be.  So, you 
know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase .  But that’ s not a 
decision that we ’ve made at all.  
So we are—you know, we ’re going to be guided by the data.  And I think you can still 
think of the , the destination as broadly in line with the  September —sorry, the  June SEP , because 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 29  
 it’s only six weeks old.  And sometimes , sometimes  SEPs can get old really quick.  I think in this 
one—this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the 
Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year.  So I would point 
you to that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I 
wanted to ask about right now , there ’s a sort of growing gap between the F ed’s preferred 
measure of inflation, the PCE , PCE index, a nd the one that ’s followed by the public, the CPI, of 
course.  How do you expect to handle  this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for 
you to consi der slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings?  
Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s an interesting, interesting situation.  Of course, we’ ve, we’ve  
long used PCE because we think it ’s just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face 
in their lives.  And I think that  that view is pretty widely understood.  That said, the public really 
reads about CPI.  And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like 
food, gasoline, motor vehic les, and housing than the PCE index does.  And so that accounts for a 
lot of the difference.  However, over time, they tend to come together.  
You know, we —given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and 
noticing it and everything like that.  But remember, we do target PCE.  That is because we think 
it’s a better measure.  They will come together eventually.  The typical gap was really about 
25 basis points for a very long time.  And if it went —if it got to 40 basis points, that would be 
very noticeable.  And now it ’s—now it’s  much larger than that because of the things I 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 29  
 mentioned.  So we ’ll be watching both, but , again, the one that we think is the best measure 
always has been PCE , at least since I think we —some 20 plus years ago— moved to PCE.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  I ’d like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman.  
Michael McK ee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.  You said that the destination pretty much 
remains the same in terms of your end -of-the-year target.  But where are you in the journey?  
We’ve now seen the federal stimulus programs end.  You mentioned consumer spending, 
business investment have slowed.  Are they moving at a pace you would expect?  Or is demand 
still greater than supply —too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more?  
And I ask be cause there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as y ou mentioned.  And a lot 
of this might hit in 2023.  The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be 
weak.  How, how  do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, just talking about demand for a  second :   As I mentioned in my 
remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter —
consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that.  I think, you know, 
people widely looked at the first -quarter numbers and thought they didn ’t make sense and might 
have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy—[that was] not , not true 
of the second quarter.  But at the same time, you have this labor market.  
So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor 
market as strong.  And the economy has gone right through that and been fine.  So that —that ’s 
happened many times.  And it used to happen— if you remember, in the first quarter of every 
year, for several y ears in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 29  
 fine.  And it turned out to just be measurement error.  It was called residual seasonality.  We 
don’t know the situation.  
The truth is, though, we , we think that demand is moderating.  We do.  How much is it 
moderating?  We’ re not sure.  We’re going to have to watch the data carefully.  There are —there 
is a great deal of money on people ’s balance sheets that they can spend.  The unemployment rate 
is ver y low.  The labor market ’s very hot.  There are many, many job openings.  Wages are high.  
So it’s the kind of thing where you think that the —that the  economy should actually be , be doing 
pretty well in the second half of the year.  But we ’ll have to see.  We don’ t know that because 
you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does —that is fairly broad.  So we ’ll be 
watching that .  We’ll be watching that.  Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand 
running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nicole.  
NICOLE GOODKIND.  Hi, thank you, Chairman.  Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business.  
When does the C ommittee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market?  An d how 
much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think you ’re already seeing —you’ ve seen , in the labor market, 
what you’ ve seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year 
to modestly slower job creation —still, still quite robust, as I mentioned.  So you’ re seeing that.  
You’re seeing some increase—some increase in initial claims from insurance, al though that may 
actually have to do with seasonal adjustments.  We’re not sure that that ’s actually real.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 29  
 There ’s some evidence that wages— if you look at average hour ly earnings, they appear 
to be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures.  And we ’ll be getting the 
employment compensation index measurement , I think, on Friday, I guess.  And that ’s a very 
important one because it adjusts for compensation—composition.  
So I’d say you—and also, anecdotally, you hear much—the sort of level of concern  on 
the part of businesses that they simply can ’t find workers is probably down a little bit from what 
it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year.  So there ’s a feeling that the labor 
market is moving back into balance.  If you look at —if you look at  job openings or quits, you see 
them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down.  But it’ s only the beginning of an adjustment.   
But I think most —also, if you look at —I mean, once you start citing these things, you 
can’t stop.  If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the 
household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three  months.  So that 
might be a signal that job creation ’s actually a little bit slower than we ’re seeing i n the —in the  
establishment survey.  So executive summary [is]:  I would say t here’s some evidence that labor 
demand may be slowing a bit —labor supply, not so much.  We have been disappointed that labor 
force participation really hasn ’t moved up since January.  That may be related to yet another big 
wave of COVID.  And there ’s evidence that that ’s the case.  But—So we ’re not seeing much in 
the way of labor supply.  Nonetheless, I would say some , some  progress on demand and  supply 
gettin g back in alignment. 
NICOLE GOODKIND.  And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept 
before you think about pausing rate cuts?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I think we’re looking— we’re going to be looking at , at inflation 
as well.  You know, a s I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down.  We need to be 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 29  
 confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate -consistent levels.  That ’s not 
something we can avoid doing.  That really needs to happen.  
And, but we do think, though, that the labor ma rket can adjust because of the huge 
overhang of job openings , of excess demand, really.  There should be able to be an adjustment 
that would have lower than—perhaps lower -than-expected increases in unemployment —lower 
than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level —the ratio of, of  
vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.  And that suggests that 
this time could be different.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward Lawrence.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business.  So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession.  So how , how  
close are we to a recession?  And then how do forecast s of possible recession from banks and 
economists, how does that make a soft landing you’ ve talked about more difficult?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So as , as I mentioned, it doesn’ t seem that the  U.S. economy is in 
recession right now.  And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown—let ’s put it that way —
in growth.  And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned.  But there ’s also just 
the very strong data coming out of the labor market, still.  So, overall, you would say that , in all 
probability, demand i s still strong , and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this 
year.  But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable.  And we ’re—you know, we’re  going to 
be watching that carefully.  Sorry, what was the —  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Forecast s.  You know, how do bank forecast s of possible 
recessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing?  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL

 CHAIR POWELL.  Well , you know, w e’ve said since the beginning, I think, that , that  
having a soft landing is what we ’re aiming for.  Of course, that has t o be our goal .  It is our goal.  
And we ’ll keep trying to achieve it.  I think —I do think events —at the beginning, we said it was 
not going to be easy.  It was going to be quite challenging to do that.  It’s unusual.  It ’s an 
unusual event .  It’s not a typical event , given where we are.  
If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned , that the labor 
market actually is —has  such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see —you could 
see that demand coming down in a way that didn ’t translate into a big increase in unemployment 
as you would expect in the ordinary course because , frankly, the imbalance is so much greater.  
And, but we don’ t know that.  I mean, t his is a—this is a case of first impression.  So anyone 
who is  really sure that it’ s impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably 
underestimating the level of uncertainty.  And so I would certainly say it ’s an uncertain , 
uncertain  thing.  Nonetheless, it ’s our goal to achieve it, and we ’ll keep trying to do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean.  
JEAN YUNG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to 
ask about the balance sheet reduction program.  It’s been working for a couple months now and 
in a different environment than the last time the Fed did it.  What are you learning about how it ’s 
working and how markets are reacting?  And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed 
in the system still s everal years away at the current pace?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we think it ’s working fine.  As you know, we , we tapered up into 
it.  And , and  in September, we ’ll go to full strength.  And the markets seem to have accepted it.  
By all assessments, the market s should be able to absorb this.  And we expect that ’ll be the case.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 29  
 So I would say the plan is broadly on track.  It’s a little bit slow to get going because some of 
these trades  don’t settle  until—for a bit of time.  But it’ ll be picking up steam.  
So I guess your second question was getting—the process of getting back down to the 
new equilibrium will take a while.  And that time, it’ s hard to be precise, but , you know, the 
model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing.  And 
this is a much faster pace than the last time.  Balance sheet ’s much , much bigger than it was.  But 
we looked  at this carefully , and we thought that this , this  was the sensible pace.  And we have no 
reason to think it ’s not.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Brian.  
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance.  Looking at 
financial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10  year coming 
down, 30- year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways , when we talk about a hot housing 
market still.  Just wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you 
continue to raise rates.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So a big piece of that is inflation expectations —you know, 
breakevens coming down, w hich, you know, is a good thing.  It’s a good thing that markets do 
seem to have confidence in , in the C ommittee ’s commitment to getting inflation back down to 
2 percent .  So we like to see market -based , you know, readings  of inflation expectations come 
down.  You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit.  I mean, t he 
way this works is we , we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial 
conditions are what affects the economy.  
And we don ’t control that second step.  We’ re just going to do what we think needs to be 
done.  We’ re going to— we’re going to get our policy rate to a level where  we’re confident that 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 29  
 inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent .  Confident.  So that ’s how we ’re going to take 
it.  And , of course, we ’ll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight 
and that they’ re having the effect th at we would hope they’ re having, which is to see demand 
moderate and inflationary pressures recede and , ultimately , inflation come down.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I wonder if 
you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation , when the 
Committee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases.  I think it was December 
2020.  There ’s a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that a nd saying that maybe 
that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind— not his words but 
maybe , you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation.  So could you talk about 
that decision , and have you looked at it in hindsig ht at all?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, ye s, we said that we wouldn’ t lift off until we had basically 
achieved our dual -mandate goals.  And the reason we did it in real time was that , the first look at 
the new framework that we ’d rolled out, plenty of people were saying, “I t’s not credible .  You’ll 
never get inflation to 2 percent .”  Some of our critics now who say inflation’ s too tight —too high 
were the same ones who were saying , “You’ll never get to 2  percent .”  Well, but anyway , that’s 
what happened.  
So we , we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that.  It wasn ’t part 
of the framework.  The December ’20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework.  I t 
was just guidance that we put in place.  So I would say two things.  One, I don’ t think that that 
has materially changed the situation.  But I have to admit, I don’ t think I would do that again.  I 
don’t think I would do that again.  We —you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 29  
 unexpected way for all of us.  And , you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more 
flexibility than that.  
But did it matter in the end?  You know, we —if you look at —I really don ’t think it did .  
I’m not sure it would’ ve mattered if we ’d been raising rates three months earlier .  Does anybody 
think that would’ ve made a big difference?  I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three 
months earlier , and it didn’ t matter.  I mean, this is a—this is a  global ph enomenon that ’s 
happening now —admittedly, different in the United States , but anyway.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy.  
GREG ROBB.   Can I follow up?  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Sorry about that, Greg.  
GREG ROBB.  Just a lot of people talk about that time , and they talk about a taper 
tantrum.  I know you haven’ t talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time 
about repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a G overnor.  So was that part of 
that?  Where did that fit into all those  decisions ?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we learned—there ’ve been multiple taper tantrums, right?  
So there was the famous one in 2013.  There ’s what happened at the December ’ 18 meeting, 
where , you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end 
and then suddenly react very sharply.  So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably 
and doing it in steps and things like that.  It was just like that’ s how we did it.  And so we did it 
that way this time.  We were—we were  careful  to, to take steps and communicate and all that 
kind of thing.  Ye s, we were trying to avoid a tantrum b ecause they can be quite destructive.  
They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter.  And, you know, when it 
happens, you have to—really , in both ’ 13 and ’ 18, it really had consequences for the real 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 29  
 economy, you know, two, three, four months later.  So we were trying t o avoid that.  That was 
part of it.  
Again, I don ’t think that’ s—the real issue of 2020 and ’ 21 was just trying to understand 
what was happening with the reopening economy.  That , that  was where the big uncertainty was.  
And, you know, our view was that these supply -side issues would get better :  that people would 
go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, e veryone would get vaccinated, 
schools would open, kids would be in school , and labor force participation would jump back up.  
That’s what we were—that was very broadly thought to be the case :  these supply- side issues 
would get solved reasonably quickly.  A nd they just haven’ t.  They still haven’ t.  
So that ’s really the learning , I think , is around how complicated these supply- side issues 
can be.  We haven ’t seen this before in a long, long time.  And so that ’s really , you know, what 
accounts for the pace at which we moved , and we did.  W hen inflation changed direction, really, 
in October , we’ve moved quickly since then.  I thin k people would agree.  But before then, 
inflation was coming down month by month.  And , you know, we kind of thought we had the 
story —probably had the story right.  But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of 
data that said “N o.  This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we ’ve been 
thinking. ”  And, again, we ’ve pivoted, and here we are.  
GREG ROBB.  Thanks. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession.  So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the  U.S. in a 
recession?  And just remind us , what is your definition for the start of a recession?  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.   So the Fed doesn’ t make a —doesn’t make a  judgment on that.  You 
know, w e’re focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment 
and price stability.  We don ’t—we don’t  say “T here is now a recession ” and that kind of thing.  
So that wouldn’ t be something we ’d do.  We would look at the data tomorrow —and no doubt, 
we’ll look at it very carefully —and draw whatever implications we can.  
As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflatio n—sorry, what a 
recession really is, it ’s a broad- based decline across many industries that , you know, is sustain ed 
for more than a couple of months , and there are a bunch of specific tests in it.  And  it just 
doesn’t —this just doesn’ t seem like that now.  What we have right now doesn’ t seem like that.  
And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength 
that it makes you really question the GDP data.  But , again, that ’s not a decision that we —that 
we make.  And w e won ’t—we won’t  reach a conclusion one way or another on that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon.  
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you very much.  Simon Rabinovitch with the 
Economist .  You said that some softening in the labor market is needed.  Within the F ed, there 
are staff economists who ’ve argue d that N AIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment, 
might be as high as 5 to 6 percent  right now , which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate 
of 3.6.  What ’s your assessment of N AIRU?  Is that something that came up in discussion with 
the C ommittee?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the —that the  
natural  rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we 
think it was before.  And the reason is there’s —it’ s the usual matching issue , where m atching has 
become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 29  
 the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that.  So it could be higher.  And my 
own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher.  Of course, I would add that we 
don’t know  it.  We can never know where these star variables are in real time w ith any 
confidence.  But I would say it must have move d up materiall y.  
But the other side of that is , as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and 
unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly.  And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation b ecause it ’s 
that gap— it’s the gap between actual unemployment and the —and the  natural rate that really is 
relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy w ith the overtight labor 
market.  So  if you were to—you wouldn’ t observe this.  It’s an unobservabl e, but you could 
actually be seeing inflationary pressures com ing down if that does happen.  And we don’ t—we 
don’t  control that.  But that ’s something that, logically , if the pandemic and the disorder in the 
labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in 
principle, you should see it move back down.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeff.  
JEFF COX.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.  Just a question 
about —hate to keep banging the drum about recession.  But most of the polls that we ’re seeing 
now from the public, people believe that we ’re already in a recession or heading for one—
economists, pretty much the same thing.  They ’re being told by folks like you and the 
Administration that we ’re not in a recession, we ’re not heading for a recession—frankly, coming 
from the same people who  told them inflation was transitory , telling them now that we ’re not 
heading for a recession.  So wh at would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel 
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 29  
 confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a —to a  potential 
downturn in the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, a ll I’ve really said is I don ’t think it’ s likely that the U .S. 
economy’ s in a recession now .  And I ’ve explained why that is the case.  It’s, it’s because you do 
see a very strong labor market.  And I think the public will see that as well.  You know, going 
forward, what we ’ve seen is a—is a slowing in spending, a s I mentioned.  We’ve seen the very 
beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the —in the  tightness of the labor market, but it would 
only be the beginnings.  
So, and I mentioned that , that —I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down a nd 
have a so -called soft landing , by which I mean a landing that doesn’ t require a significant 
increase, a really significant increase in unemployment.  We ’re trying to achieve that.  I have 
said, on ma ny occasions , that we understand that ’s going to be quite challenging and that it ’s got 
more challenging over recent months.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Kyle Campbell with American Banker.   
The FOMC has historically trie d to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has 
happened so far this year.  How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we ’ve seen thus far 
might increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally ?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I mean , there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly —
for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more  so.  So we ’ve been known to do that when it ’s the 
appropriate thing to do.  And this year, it clearly is.  I would say that , given how quickly we ’ve 
moved, I ’m gratified that while —that, basically , markets have been working.  T hey’ve been 
orderly.  There ’s been some volatility, but that ’s only to be expected.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 29  
 For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down , which in some —in 
some  sense lowers vulnerabilities.  It’s when they ’re really high that you would worry that 
they’ re—that they’re  vulnerable to a fall, actually.  Many asset values have come down.  I think 
you’ve got a well -capitalized banking system.  I think you have —households are generally in 
about as strong as financial shape as they ’ve been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the 
money that ’s on people ’s balance sheets.  So you have a pretty—from a financial stability 
standpoint , you have a pretty decent picture .  
Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don ’t rise to the 
level of financial stability concerns.  By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things 
that might undermine the working of the financial system , so big, serious things.  That ’s not to 
say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren’t , aren’t suffering , because they are.  
They ’re suffering from high inflation.  They’re  going to the —to the grocery store and finding 
that, in many cases, their p aycheck doesn ’t cover the food they’ re accustomed to buying.  We’ re 
seeing actual , you know, real declines in food consumption.  And, you know, it’ s very 
concerning.  It’s very unfortunate.  And that ’s why we ’re—we’re  really committed to bringing 
down inflation—one of the reasons.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Mark for the last question.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  I can 
remember when you held your first news conference , and you vowed to be a very plainspoken 
Chairman , and we ’re thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well.  
What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflatio n as they try to translate what Fed  policy means to them in this 
complicated economic landscape?  Thank you.  
July 27, 202 2   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 29 of 29  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess the first thing I would say to , to every household is that 
we know that inflation is too high.  We understand how painf ul it is , particularly for people who 
are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food 
and gas a nd heating their homes and clothing and things like that.  We do understand that , that  
those people suffer the most.  Middle -class and better -off people have some resources, where 
they can absorb these things.  But  people, many people , don’ t have those resources.  So , you 
know, we —it is our job .  It is our institutional role .  We are assigned uniquely and 
unconditionall y the obligation of , of providing price stability to the American people.  And we ’re 
going to use our tools to do that.  
As I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market 
conditions.  We need growth to slow to below potential growth.  We don’ t want to —we don’ t 
want this to be bigger than it needs to be .  But, ultimately , if you think about the medium and 
longer term, price stability is the thing that , that  makes the whole economy work.  It ’s what 
can—it can  give us a strong labor market and wages that aren ’t being eaten up by high inflation.  
If you talk to people —again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages—
they’ re the ones who are suffering the most from inflation.  So it ’s all the more  reason why we 
need to move , move  on this.  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
September 21 , 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL .  Good afternoon .  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to 
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal .  We have both the tools we need and the 
resolve  that it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses .  
Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our 
economy.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone .  In particular, without 
price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all . 
Today the FOMC raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point, and we anticipate 
that ongoing increases w ill be appropriate .  We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a 
level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.  In addition, we are 
continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet .  I will have more to 
say about today’ s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments . 
The U.S . economy has slowed from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which 
reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recessi on.  Recent indicators 
point to modest growth of spending and production.  Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year’ s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter financial 
conditions .  Activity in the housing sector  has weakened significantly, in large part reflecting 
higher mortgage rates .  Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be 
weighing on business fixed investment, while weaker economic growth abroad is restraining exports .  As shown in our Summary of Economic Projections, since June , FOMC participants 
have marked down their projections for economic activity, with the median projection for real 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 21  
 GDP growth standing at just 0.2 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the 
medi an estimate of the longer -run normal growth rate . 
Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market has remained extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate near a 50- year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth 
elevated .  Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 378,000 jobs per 
month over the last three months .  The labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand 
for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers .  The labor force 
participation rate showed a welcome uptick in August but is little changed since the beginning of 
the year .  FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come 
into better balance over time, easing the upward pressure on wages and prices .  The median 
projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.4 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than in the June projections .  Over the next three years, the median 
unemployment rate runs above the median estimate of its longer -run normal level.  
Inflation remains well above our 2 percent longer- run goal .  Over the 12 months ending 
in July, total PCE prices rose 6.3 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent .  In August, the 12 -month change in the consumer p rice i ndex was 
8.3 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6.3 percent .  Price pressures remain evident 
across a broad range of goods and services.  Although gasoline prices have turned down in recent months, they remain well above year -earlier levels, in part reflecting Russia ’s war against  
Ukraine, which has boosted prices for energy and food and has created additional upward pressure on inflation.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflat ion is 5.4 percent this 
year and falls to 2.8 percent next year, 2.3 percent in 2024, and 2 percent in 2025.  P articipants 
continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside . 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 21  
 Despite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear t o remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as 
well as measures from financial markets.  But that is not grounds for complacency; the longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.  
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people .  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for  
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to b oth sides of our mandate, and we are 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective . 
At today’ s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
¾ percentage point, bringing the target range to 3 to 3 ¼ perc ent.  And we are continuing the 
process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy.  
Over coming months, we will be looking for compelling evidence that inflation is moving  
down consistent with inflation returning to 2 percent .  We anticipate that ongoing increases in the 
target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate; the pace of those increases will continue to depend on the incoming data and the evolving outl ook for the economy.  With 
today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 percentage points this year .  At some point, as 
the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess how our c umulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 21  
 inflation .  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our 
thinking as clearly as possible.  
Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive po licy stance for 
some time .  The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy .  As 
shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate is 
4.4 percent at the end of this year, 1 percentage p oint higher than projected in June .  The median 
projection rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year and declines to 2.9 percent by the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer -run value .  Of course, these projections do not 
represent a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now.  
We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better 
alignment with supply .  Our overarching focus is usi ng our tools to bring inflation back down to 
our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .  Reducing 
inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth, and there will very likely 
be some softening of  labor market conditions .  Restoring price stability is essential to set the 
stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run .  We will keep 
at it until we are confident the job is done . 
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country .  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals . 
Thank you, and I look forw ard to your questions.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking our questions .  Jeanna 
Smialek from t he New York Times.  I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 5 of 21  
 you’ll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you’ ll eventually know when 
to stop.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I will answer—I will answer your question directly, but I want to 
start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole.  The 
FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflati on down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the 
job is done .  So the way we ’re thinking about this is , the overarching focus of the Committee is 
getting inflation back down to 2 percent .  To accomplish that, we think we ’ll need to do two 
things , in particular:  to achieve a period of growth below trend;  and also some softening in labor 
market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in  the labor market.   
So on the first, the Committee ’s forecast s and those of most outside forecasters do show 
growth running below its longer -run potential this year and next year .  On the second , though, so 
far there ’s only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off .  Job openings are down a 
bit, as you know ; quits are off their all- time highs ; there ’s some signs that some wage measures 
may be flattening out but not moving up;  payroll gains have moderated but not much.  And in 
light of the high inflation we ’re seeing, we think we ’ll need to—and in light of w hat I just said, 
we think that we ’ll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for 
some  time . 
So, what will we be looking at , I guess , is your question.  So we ’ll be looking at a few 
things .  First, we ’ll want to see growth c ontinuing to run below trend, we ’ll want to see 
movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately , we’ll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent .  
So that ’s what  we’ll be looking for .  In terms of reducing rates, I think we ’d want to be very 
confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that .

Page 6 of 21  
 MICHELLE SMITH .  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Can you talk 
about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for 
rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates ?  Well, can you envision a 
time when there ’s a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate 
increases?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  Sure .  So, of course , monetary policy does , famously , work with long 
and variable lags .  The way I think of it is , our policy decisions affect financial conditions 
immediately .  In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually 
announce our decisions .  Then , changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity 
fairly quickly, within a few months .  But it’ s likely to take some time to see the full effects of 
changing financial conditions on inflation.  So we are very much mindful for that .  And that ’s 
why I noted in my opening remarks that , at some point, as the stance of poli cy tightens further, it 
will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation .  So that ’s how we think about that . 
Your second question—sorry —was?  
STEVE LIESMAN .  Is there a point in time you could see pausing?  Is it linear?  Do  you 
keep raising rates, or is there—oh, sorry , I should know better than to not talk with a 
microphone.  
CHAIR POWELL .  I should know better than to answer your second question.  
[Laughte r] 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Well , there you go.  Is it linear?  Do you keep raising rates , or is 
there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 21  
 economy and give time to catch up in the real economy—the rate increase time to catch up in  the 
real economy?  Thank you.   
CHAIR POWELL .  So I think it ’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is 
going to unfold.  As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our 
policy rate to a restrictive level that’ s restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, 
where we have confidence of that .  And what you see in the SEP numbers is people ’s views as of 
today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate . 
Now, those will evolve over time , and I think we ’ll just have to see how that goes .  There 
is a possibility , certainly , that we would go to a certain level that we ’re confident in and stay 
there for a time .  But we ’re not at that level.  C learly , today we ’re, we’ve just moved, I think, 
probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive , and, certainly , in my view and 
the view of the Committee, there ’s a ways to go . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay.  Rachel . 
RACHEL SIEGEL .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thank 
you for taking our questions .  The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent 
next year, and, historically , that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a 
recession with it .  Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise 
necessary to get inflation down?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So you’ re right—in the SEP, there ’s what I would 
characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation.  Now, why is that?  So , really, that is what 
we generally expect because we see the current situation  as outside of historical experience in a 
number of ways , and I ’ll mention a couple of those .  First—and you know these —but first, job 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 21  
 openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work.  It’ s plausible, 
I’ll say , that job openi ngs could come down significantly—and they need to—without as much 
of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes .  So that ’s one 
thing.  
In addition, in this cycle, longer -run inflation expectations have generally been fairly  well 
anchored, and , as I ’ve said, there ’s no basis for complacency there.  B ut to the extent that 
continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability .  And I guess the 
third thing I would point to that ’s different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this 
series of supply shocks that we ’ve had, beginning with the pandemic , and, really , with the 
reopening of  the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia ’s invasion of 
Ukraine —have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation . 
So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in 
principle, if those things start to get better—and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of 
that.  It’s not much more than that, but it ’s good to see that .  For example, commodity prices look 
like they may have peaked for now ; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve.   Those 
developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation.  
So let me just say,  how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence 
of events —it remains to be seen .  We have always understood that restoring price stability while 
achieving a relatively modest decline —or, rather , increase—in unemployment and a soft l anding 
would be very challenging.  A nd we don’ t know —no one knows whether this process will lead 
to a recession or , if so, how significant that recession would be .  That ’s going to depend on how 
quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether  expectations remain anchored, 
and whether , also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well . 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 21  
 In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy 
needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer.  No netheless, we’ re committed to getting 
inflation back down to 2 percent —because we think that a failure to restore price stability would 
mean far greater pain later on . 
RACHEL SIEGEL .  Just to follow up on one small thing—are vacancies still at the top of 
your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Yes, vacancies are still almost  a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people .  
That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how 
different it is from other cycles, where , generally , the unemployment rate itself is the single best 
indicator .  We think those things have , for quite a time now, really added value in terms of 
understanding where the labor market is .   
MICHELLE SM ITH.  Nick . 
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  You said not too long 
ago, in describing the policy destination, there ’s still a way to go .  But I imagine you have to 
have some idea about how you’ re thinking about your destination, w hether it ’s a stopping point 
or a pausing point .  And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as 
the data come in, where that destination is, how it ’s moving up.  I f inflation doesn ’t perform as 
you expect, do you want to have a  policy rate that ’s above the underlying inflation rate, for 
example, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be 
in the economy right now ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Well , so, again, we believe that we need to raise our poli cy stance 
overall to a level that is restrictive—a nd by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful 
downward pressure on inflation.  That ’s what we need to see in the stance of policy .  We also 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 21  
 know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation .  So it ’s a 
challenging assessment .  So, what do you look at?  You look at broader financial conditions, as 
you know ; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases;  you look at credit 
spreads ; you look at financial conditions indexes . 
We also, I would think— and you see this in the —this is something we talked about today 
in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings .  And you see this , I think, in the Committee 
forecast .  You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve.  
And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we ’re writing down and think 
about —you measure those against some sort of forward -looking assessment of inflation, 
inflation expectations .  I think you would see at that time —you ’d see positive real rates across 
the yield curve , and that is also an important consideration.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Howard .   
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi .  Howard Schneider with Reuters .  Thanks for the 
opportunity.  I just want to be clear on the SEPs .  You say it ’s meeting by meeting, but it sure 
looks like we ’re going 75–50–25.  I s 75 next month the baseli ne? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So we make one decision per meeting , and the decision we made 
today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75  [basis points] .  You’re right that the median for 
the year -end suggests another 125 basis points in  rate increases, but there ’s also, there ’s another 
fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today.  So that would be 
25 basis points less .  So we ’re going to make that decision at the meeting.  We didn’ t make that 
decision today;  we didn’ t vote on that .  I would say that we ’re committed to getting to a 
restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly , and that ’s what we ’re 
thinking about . 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 21  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So, just as a follow -up to that, I ’m wondering about the  sort 
of risk -management considerations here , given there ’s some discussion now of overdoing it .  
What ’s the incentive to continue front -loading right now?   Is it lack of progress on inflation seen 
in the CPI reports?  Or is it a motivation to get as much d one while the job market is still as 
strong as it is? 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, what we ’ve seen is, inflation has —our expectation has been that 
we would begin to see inflation come down, l argely because of supply- side healing .  By now we 
would have thought that w e’d have seen some of that .  We haven ’t.  We have seen some supply -
side healing, but inflation has not really come down.  If you look at core PCE inflation, which is 
a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3- , 6-, and 12- month 
trailing annualized basis, you’ ll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent . 
So that ’s a pretty  good summary of where we are with inflation .  And that ’s not where we 
expected or wanted to be .  So, what that tells us is that w e need to continue , and we can —keep 
doing these, and we did today—do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to .  And we ’re still discovering what that level is .  But people are writing that 
down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be .  So that ’s how we ’re thinking about it . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Let ’s go to Colby. 
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with  the Financial Times .  Chair Powell, 
how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to 
target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024?  And does that mean there ’s a 
level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing  to tolerate?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025—in the median —and headline is at 
2.0, so that ’s pretty close .  I mean , we write down our forecasts , and we figure out what  the 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 21  
 median is , and we publish it .  So it’s not —I mean , I would say that if, actually , if the economy 
followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome .  But you’ re right—it is a tenth higher 
than 2 percent. 
COLBY SMITH.  Okay .  Just as a quick follow -up:  I mean , if the concern is that 
underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps , each month, then why forgo the 
more aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Yeah .  So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between  
that one  and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming 
in.  So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high 
reading for August .  So I think you have to—you can’ t really —you never want to overreact too 
much to any one data point . 
So if you look at them together —and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year ’s 
inflation, 3 -, 6-, and 12- month trailing, you see inflation is running too high.  It’ s running 
4.5 percent or above ; you don’ t need to know much more than that .  If that’ s the one thing you 
know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance 
of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down.  That ’s how we 
think about it . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Victoria . 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico .  I wanted to ask about the 
balance sheet .  You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage -backed 
securities, but we’ ve seen significant slowing in the housing market .  Mortgage rates have gone  
up significantly, and I’m just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for 
how quickly you have the runoff on the MBS side .   
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 21  
 CHAIR POWELL .  So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that 
once balance sheet  runoff is well under  way .  I would say it ’s not something we ’re considering 
right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term .  It’s just, it ’s something 
I think we will turn to , but that time, the time for turning to it,  has not come and is no t close.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision?  
CHAIR POWELL .  I think a number of things might affect that decision, really .  The 
main thing is, we ’re not considering that decision , and I don’ t expect that we will an y time soon.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN .  Thanks .  Neil Irwin with Axios .  A number of commentators have come 
to the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the 
world is, creates a risk of a glo bal recession that ’s worse than is necessary to bring inflation 
down.  How do you see that risk?  How do you think of coordination with your fellow central 
bankers?  And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So we, actually , my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC 
colleagues and I , just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with 
other senior central bank officials from around the world .  We are in pretty regular contact, and 
we exchange, of course —we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives—in our case, the 
dual mandate, maximum employment  and price stability .  But we regularly discuss what we’ re 
seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it ’s a very  ongoing, 
constant kind of a process . 
So we are very aware of what ’s going on in other economies around the world and what 
that means for us, and vice versa .  The forecast s that we put together, that our staff puts together, 
and that we put together on our  own always take all of that —try to take all of that into account .  I 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 21  
 mean , I can ’t say that we do it perfectly, but it’ s not as if we don ’t think about the policy 
decisions —monetary policy and otherwise —the economic developments that are taking place in 
major economies that can have an effect on the U.S . economy.  T hat is very much baked into our 
own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S . economy, as best we can .  It won ’t be 
perfect . 
So I don’ t see—it’s hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very 
different levels of interest rates .  If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and 
things like that at various times , but, really, we ’re all, we ’re in very different situations .  But I 
will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it ’s not coordination , but there ’s a lot of 
information sharing.  A nd we all , I think, are informed by what other important economies —
economies that are important to the United States —are doing. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Craig .   
CRAIG TORRES .  Craig Torres from Bloomberg .  Chair Powell, you talked about some 
ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we ’ve also seen a resilient labor 
market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I ’m wondering what your s tory is 
on the resilience of the economy.  A fter all, you and your colleagues said, “Well, we started 
tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future .”  And, indeed, 
Treasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tighte ning taking e ffect.  Why is the 
economy, in your view, so resilient , and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher 
terminal rate ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  You ’re right, of course —the labor market, in particular , has been 
very strong.  But there are—the secto rs of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are 
certainly showing the effects of our tightening , and , of course , the obvious example is housing, 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 21  
 where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down.  
So we ’re having an effect on interest -sensitive spending.  I think, through exchange rates , we’re 
having an effect on expo rts and imports .  I think —so all of that ’s happening, but you ’re right, 
and we ’ve said this :  This is a strong, robust economy.  P eople have savings on their balance 
sheet from the period when they couldn’ t spend and where they were getting government 
transfers .  There’s still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end 
of the income spectrum —but still, some savings out there to support growth.  T he states are very 
flush with cash, so there ’s good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong 
economy.  
Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year .  We 
think of trend as being about 1.8 percent , or in that range .  We ’re forecasting growth well below 
that, and most forecasters are.  But you’ re right —there ’s certainly a possibility that growth can 
be stronger than that .  And that ’s a good thing, because that means the economy will be more 
resistant to a significant downturn .  But , of course , we are focused on the thing I started with, 
which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent .  We can ’t fail to do that .  I mean , if we were to 
fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve .  
So for now, that has to be our overarching focus , and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the 
levels of rates that we’ ll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in 
line with the SEP .  So that ’s how we think about it . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Mike .  Thank you. 
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Thank you, Mr . Chairman .  In a world of euphemisms that we live in 
here, with “below -trend growth”  and “ modest increase in unemployment, ” I’m wondering if I can 
ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people .  Do the odds now favor, given whe re 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 21  
 you are and where you’ re going with interest rates, favor a recession ?  Four  point  four percent 
unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs .  Is that acceptable job loss?  And then, given that the data 
you look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don’ t 
know what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you’ ve gone too far?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I don’ t know what the odds are .  I think that there ’s a very high 
likelihood that we ’ll have a period of what I ’ve me ntioned is below -trend growth, by which I 
mean much lower growth, and we ’re seeing that now .  So the median forecast , I think , this year 
among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth.  So that ’s very slow growth.  And then 
below trend next year .  I think the median was 1.2, also well below .  So that ’s a slower, that ’s a 
very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment .  But I think 
that’s, so that is something that we think we need to have , and we think we need to hav e softer 
labor market conditions as well . 
We’re never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is 
this:  Inflation —what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are 
suffering from inflation .  And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another 
period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us .  I wish there were a 
painless way to do that .  There isn ’t.  So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where 
we’re putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that ’s what we ’re doing.  And we 
certainly don’ t hope, we certainly haven’ t given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest 
increase in unemployment .  Nonetheless,  we need to complete this t ask. 
MICHAEL MCKEE .  But how will you know, or will you know , if you’ ve gone too far?  
CHAIR POWELL .  It’s hard to hypothetically deal with that question.  I mean , again, our 
really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy ra te up where it 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 21  
 needs to be .  And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today’ s estimate of where we think those 
rates would be .  Of course , they will evolve over time . 
MICHELLE  SMITH .  Chris Rugaber . 
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thanks .  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  I wanted to follow  up 
with what you just mentioned about the labor market .  You’ve said several times that to have the 
labor market we want, we need price stability , and you suggested maybe there isn ’t a tradeoff in 
the long run.  But in the short run, there is a lot of concern , as people have been expressing here, 
about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes .  So can you 
explain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the  job market?  I mean, you seem to 
suggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market .  So can you spell 
that out a little more for the general public on how that would work?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So, for starters, people are seeing the ir wage increases eaten up by 
inflation .  So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck 
cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they’ ve been 
going up, you’ re in trouble right away .  You don’ t have a cushion, and this is very painful for 
people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum .  So that ’s what we ’re hearing from 
people is , you know, very much—that inflation is really hurting . 
So how do we get rid of inflation?   And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a 
way to just wish it away , but there isn ’t.  We have to get supply and demand back into alignment , 
and the way we do that is by slowing the economy.  Hopefully, we do that by slowing the 
economy, and we see some softening in  labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution 
from supply -side improvements , and things like that .  But none of that is guaranteed.   
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 21  
 In any case, we, our job is to deliver price sta bility , and I think —you can think of price 
stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.  We 
really saw that for a long time .  The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn’ t move around 
much, and that was  enormously beneficial to the public that we serve .  And we have to get back 
to that and keep it for another long period of time .  To pull back from the task of doing that is, 
you’re just postponing— the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to 
lead to more pain .  So I think we ’re moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs , and that ’s 
what you see us doing.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  Thank you for taking the question, Mr . Chairman .  Edward 
Lawrence for Fox Busi ness.  So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some 
economic pain as we go forward.  How long from here should Americans be prepared for that 
economic pain?  
CHAIR POWELL .  How long?   I mean , it really depends on how long it takes for wag es 
and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.  And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.  And I think once you’ re on that path, that ’s a good thing.  
And things will start to feel better to people —they ’ll feel lower inflation, they ’ll feel that the 
economy is improving.  A nd also, if our projections are close to right, you’ ll see that the costs in 
unemployment are, they ’re meaningful, and they ’re certainly very meaningful to the people who 
lose their jobs .  And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot.  
But, at the same time, we’ d be setting the economy up for another long period— this era 
has b een noted for very long expansions .  We’ve had three  of the four longest in measured 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 19 of 21  
 history since we got inflation under control .  And that ’s not an accident .  So when inflation is 
low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11—10- year, anyway, expansions , and you can see 
what we saw in 2018, ’ 19, and ’ 20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains 
going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we ’ve seen since we 
started keeping track of that .  So we want to get back to that .  But, to get there , we’re going to 
have to get supply and demand back in alignment , and that ’s going to take tight monetary policy 
for a period of time . 
EDWARD LAWRENCE .  As a follow -up, what is that economic pain in your mind?  Is 
it job loss es?  Is it higher interest rates on credit cards?   What is that economic pain?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So it ’s all of those things .  Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a 
softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve .  But they’ re not as painful as 
failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and 
doing it at a time when , actually , now people have really come to expect high inflation.  If the 
concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in  people ’s economic thinking about their 
decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability —the cost of getting back to price stability 
just rises, and so we want to avoid that .  We want to act aggressively now and get this job done 
and keep at it unti l it’s done . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Nicole, from CNN .   
NICOLE GOODKIND.  Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Nicole Goodkind, CNN 
Business.  Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their 
highest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week , and housing prices are still 
elevated .  Now, a t the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL

 housing market .  I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say “ reset ” 
and what you think it will take to actually get there.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So when I say “ reset, ” I’m not looking at a particular, specific set of 
data or anything.  W hat I’m really saying is that we ’ve had a time of a red -hot housing market all 
over the country, where , famou sly, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the 
ask, before even seeing the house .  That kind of thing.  So there was a big imbalance between 
supply and demand.  H ousing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level .  So the 
decel eration in housing prices that we ’re seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in 
line with rents and other housing market fundamentals , and that ’s a good thing. 
For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that 
housing prices go up at a reasonable level —at a reasonable pace—and that people can afford 
houses again .  And I think we —so we probably , in the housing market , have to go through a 
correction  to get back to that place.  There ’s also, there are also longer -run issues, though, with 
the housing market .  As you know, we ’re—it’s difficult to find lots now close enough to cities 
and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and 
materials and things like that.  But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance.  
NICOLE GOODKIND.  Just to follow, though, s helter made up such a large part of this 
hot CPI report that we saw .  Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down 
in the coming months?   Or do you think that there ’s still this imbalance that needs to be 
addressed?  
CHAIR POWELL .  I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time .  
We’re looking for it to come down, but it ’s not exactly clear when that will happen .  So it may 
September 21, 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 21  
 take some time, so I think , hope for the best, plan for the worst .  So I think , on shelter inflation , 
you’ve just got to assume that it ’s going to remain pretty high for a while .   
MICHELLE SMITH .  Okay, we ’ll go to Jean for the last question . 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi .  Jean Yung with Market News.  You ’ve talked about the need to get 
real rates into positive territory , and you sa id earlier that policy is just moving into that territory 
now.  So I ’m curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected —is that expected to be next 
year?  How restrictive?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I think if you look, when we get to —if we —let ’s assume we do 
get to that level, which I think is likely .  What you’ re going to do is , you’ re going to adjust that 
for some forward -looking measure of inflation.  And that could be —you pick your measure .  It 
could be —there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get —but what you’ ll get 
is a positive number .  In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term , I 
think, that are going to be, assuming that we ’re doing our jobs appropriately, that will be 
significant . 
So you’ ll have a positive  [real] federal f unds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent 
or so, but —I mean, I don ’t know exactly what it would be .  But it would be significantly positive 
when we get to that level .  And let me say, we ’ve written down what we think is a plausible path 
for the federal f unds rate.  The path that we actually execute will be enough.  It will be enough to 
restore price stability .  So this is something that, as you can see, they ’ve moved up, and we ’re 
going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether 
our policy is in the right place as we go. 
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
November 2 , 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to 
bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  We have both the tools that we need and the 
resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.  Price 
stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.  Without pric e stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price 
stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
Today, the FOMC  raised our  policy interest rate by 75 basis point s.  And we continue to 
anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate.  We are moving our policy stance 
purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.  In addition, we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  
Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance  of policy for some 
time.  I will have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing 
economic development s. 
The U.S. economy ha s slow ed significantly from last year’s rapid pace.  Real GDP rose 
at a pace of 2.6 percent last quarter but is unchanged so far this year.  R ecent indicators point to 
modest growth of spending and production this quarter .  Growth in consumer spending has 
slowed from last year’s rapid pace, in part reflecting lower real disposable income and tighter 
financial conditions.  Activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly , largely reflecting 
higher mortgage rates.  Higher intere st rates and slower output growth also appear to be 
weighing on business fixed investment . 
Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate at  a 50- year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.

Page 2 of 23 
 Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 289,000 jobs per month 
over August and September.  Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace 
of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, 
with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.   The labor force 
participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year . 
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in September , total PCE prices rose 6.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 5.1 percent.  And the recent inflation data again have come in 
higher than expected.  Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.  Russia’s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has created  additional 
upward pressure on inflation. 
Despite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, a s 
well as measures from financial market s.  But that is  not grounds for complacency; the longer the 
current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. 
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship  as it erodes purchasing power, especially for  
those least abl e to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We 
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.

 At today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
75 basis point s.  And we are continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our 
balance sheet, which plays an important role in firming the stance of mone tary policy.  
With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 3 ¾ percentage points this year.  W e 
anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate  
in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 
2 percent over time.  Financial conditions have tightened significantly in response to our policy actions, and we are seeing the effects on demand in the most interest -rate-sensitive sectors of the 
economy, such as housing.  It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.  That’s why we say in our statement that i n determining the 
pace of future increases in the target range , we will take into account the cumulative tightening 
of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and 
inflation .  At some point —as I’ve said in the last two press conferences—it will become 
appropriate to slow the pace of increases as we approach the level of interest rates that will be sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal.  There is significant uncertainty around that level  of interest rates.  Even so, we still have some ways to go, and 
incoming data since our  last meeting suggest that the ultimate level of interest rates will be 
higher than previously expected.  Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and in flation.  W e will continue to make 
our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. 
We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment 
with supply.  Our overarching focus is using our  tools to bring inflation back down to our 
2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .  Reducing inflation 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 23  
 is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market 
conditions.  Restor ing price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum 
employment and stable prices in the longer  run.  The historical record cautions strongly against 
prematurely loosening policy.  We will stay the course until the job is done . 
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby.  
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   On the need to 
slow the pace of rate increases at some point :  Is a downshift contingent on a string of better  
inflation data specifically between now and , let’s say , the December meeting?  Or is that 
something that the F ed could potentially proceed with, independent of that data, given the lagged  
effects  that you mentioned?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So a couple things on that .  We do need to see inflation coming down 
decisively , and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings.  Of course , 
that’s what we ’d all love to see, but that ’s—I’ve never thought of that as the appropriate test for 
slowing the pac e of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we ’re 
aiming for.  We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that ’s sufficiently restrictive to 
bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  How w ill we know that 
we’ve reached that level?  Well, we’ ll take into account the full range of analysis and data that 
bear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation, 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 23  
 taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned.  We will be looking at real rates, for example, all 
across the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I ’m sure there’ s going 
to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you’ re going to slow in December or 
not.  Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis poi nt increase?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of 
our broader tightening program , if I may , and talk about the statement language along the way.  
So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions , the 
first of which was , and has been, how fast to go.   The second is how high to raise our policy rate .  
And the  third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level . 
So on the first question —how fast to tighten policy—it ’s been very important that we 
move expeditiously, and we have clearly done so .  We’ve moved 3¾ percent since March, 
admittedly from a base of zero.  It’s a historically fast pace , and that ’s certainly appropriate given 
the persistence and streng th in inflation and the low level from which we started.  
So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate .  And 
we’re saying that we’ d raise that rate to a level that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to 
our 2 percent target over time , and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really 
does become the important question,  we think now, is how far to go.  A nd I’ll talk more about 
that.  We think there ’s some ground to cover before we meet that test , and that ’s why we say that 
ongoing rate increases will be appropriate .  And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the 
meetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 23  
 we may ultimately move to higher  levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting.  
That level is very uncertain , though, and I would say we ’re going to find it over time.  
Of course , with the lags between policy and economic activity, there ’s a lot of 
uncertainty, so we note t hat in determining the pace of future increases, we ’ll take into account 
the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy 
affects economic activity and inflation.  So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed become s less important than the second and 
third questions .  And that ’s why I ’ve said at the last two press conferences that at some point , it 
will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.  So that time is coming , and it may come 
as soon as the next meeting or the one after that.  No decision has been made.  It is likely we ’ll 
have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion.  To be clear , let me say again  
[that] the question  of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than 
the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which 
really will be our princip al focus.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow  up on that , to what degree was there an 
importance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns , really 
around the globe , about Fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else dealing with their 
own stress as a result?  
CHAIR POWE LL.  Well, I think I’ m pleased that we have moved as fast as we have.  I 
don’t think we ’ve overtightened.  I think there ’s—very difficult  to make a case that our current 
level is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the  federal f unds r ate.  So I think that 
at this meeting, as in the last two meetings, as I’ ve mentioned, I ’ve said that we—that there 
would come a point, and t his was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 23  
 mean .  And we did discuss this , and, as I mentioned, we’ ll discuss it again in December.  But 
there ’s no— I don’ t have any sense that we’ ve overtightened or moved too fast.  I think it’ s been 
good and a successful program that we ’ve gotten this far this fast.  Remember , though, that we 
still think there ’s a need for ongoing rate increases , and we have some gr ound left to cover here , 
and cover it we will.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, core PCE 
inflation on a 3-  or 6- month annualized basis and on a 12- month basis has been running in the 
high 4s, close to 5 percent.  Is there any reason to think you won’ t have to raise rates at least 
above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So this is the question of , does the policy rate need to get above the 
inflation rate?  And I would say, there are a range of view s on it .  That ’s the classic “Taylor 
principle ” view.  But I would think you’ d look more at a forward, a forward -looking measure of 
inflation to look at that.  But I think the answer is , we’ll want to get the policy rate to a level 
where it is, where the real interest rate is positive.  We will want to do that.  I do not think of it as 
the single and only touchstone , though.  I think you put some weight on that ; you also put some 
weight on rates across the curve.  Very few people borrow at the short end —at the federal funds 
rate, for example .  So households and businesses, if they’ re [borrowing] —[there are] very 
meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher , and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a 
bit.  So  I would look at that as an important feature.  I ’d put some weight on it , but I wouldn’ t 
say it ’s something that is the single , dominant thing to look at. 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 23  
 NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could follow  up:  W hat is your best assessment , or the staff ’s 
best assessment right now , of the current rate of underlying inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t have a specific number for you there.  There are many, many 
models that look at that .  And, I mean , one way to look at it is  that it ’s a pretty stationary object 
and that when inflation runs —above that level , for sure —substantially above for some time, 
you’ll see it move up , but the movement will be fairly gradual.  So I think that ’s what the 
princip al models would tend to say.  But I wouldn’ t want to land on any one assessment.  There 
are many different —as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying 
inflation.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you for taking our questions.  Jeanna 
Smialek with the New York Times.   I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that 
inflation is , or is at risk of becoming , entrenched? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Is inflation becoming entrenched?  So I guess I would start by 
pointing to expectations .  So if we saw longer -term expectations moving up, that would be very 
troubling.  And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they ’ve 
moved now back down.  T hat’s one piece of data.  Shorter -term inflation expectations moved up 
between the last meeting and this meeting, and we don’ t think those are as indicative , but they 
may be important in the wage -setting process.  There ’s a school of thought that believes that.  So 
that’s very concerning.  
I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have —we ’re now 18 months into 
this episode of high inflation , and we don’ t have a clearly identified , scientific way of 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 23  
 understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched.  And so the thing we need to do from 
a risk -management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation 
under control —get it down to 2 percent —get it behind us.  That ’s what we really need to do and 
what we ’re strongly committed to doing. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Thank you for taking our questions.  Rachel 
Siegel from t he Washington Post.  The statement points to lag times .  I’m wondering if you can 
walk us through how you judge those lag e ffects, what that timeline looks like over the coming 
months or even a year , and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the 
economy.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the way I would think about that is , it’s commonly, for a long 
time, thought that monetary policy works with “ long and variable lags ,” and that it works first on 
financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on 
inflation.  So that ’s been the thinking for a long time.  There was an old literature that made 
those lags out to be fairly long.  There ’s newer literature that says that they ’re shorter.   The truth 
is, we don’ t have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high i n what is , now , the 
modern economy.  One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the f ederal 
funds r ate, financial conditions would react , and then that would affect economic activity and 
inflation.  Now financial conditions react wel l before in  expectation of monetary policy  [actions] .  
That’s the way it has moved for a quarter of a century —in the direction of financial conditions , 
then monetary policy—because the markets are thinking , what  is the c entral bank going to do?  
And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the 
effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before.   We don ’t know 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 23  
 that.  I guess the thing that I would say is :  It’s highly uncertain—highly uncertain.  A nd so from 
a risk -management  standpoint —but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them .  
But you want to consider them but not take them literally.  So I think it ’s a very difficult place to 
be, but I would t end to be —want to be in the middle looking carefully at what ’s actually 
happening with the economy a nd trying to make good decisions from a risk- management 
standpoint, remembering , of course , that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools 
strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don’ t get inflation under control because we 
don’t tighten enough, now we ’re in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the 
costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially .  So from a risk -
management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don’ t make the mistake of either failing to 
tighten enough or loosening policy too soon. 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And if I could follow  up:  S hould we interpret the addition to the 
statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag e ffects than they would have been after 
previous rate hikes?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these 
ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it ’ll be appropriate now to be thinking 
more about lags .  Of course, we think about lag s—the lags are just sort of a basic part of 
monetary policy .  But we will be thinking about them , but we won’ t be—I think we ’ll be 
considering them but because it ’s appropriate to do so.  Let me say this :  It is very premature to 
be thinking about pausing.  So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause.  It’s very 
premature , in my view , to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike.  We have a ways 
to go.  O ur policy—we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive.  
And we don ’t—of course , we don’ t really know exactly where that is.  We have a sense, and 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 23  
 we’ll write down in September—sorry, in the December meeting , a new S ummary of Economic 
Projections , which updates that.  But I would expect us  to continue to update  it based on what 
we’re seeing with incoming data.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil Irwin.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell .  Neil Irwin, Axios.  As you look around the 
economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some 
venture -funded tech companies .  It’s been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market, 
consumer demand;  a lot of sectors , you don’ t see a ton of effect.  Is the pathway and channels 
through which monetary policy works changing?  Is it narrower than it used to be?  And on 
housing in particular, are you at all worried that you’ re cramping housing supply in ways that 
might cause problems down the road?  
CHAIR P OWELL.  I don’ t know that the channels through which policy works have 
changed that much.  I would say a big channel is the labor market , and the labor market is very, 
very strong.  Very strong.  And households , of course , have strong balance sheets.  So w e go into 
this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through 
many different things , and also with households who have strong spending power built up.  So it 
may take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience.  I t’s likely to, to get inflation down.  It 
may—I think you see , from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to 
come down.  It’ ll take time, we think.  So , sorry, was I getting to your question there?  
NEIL IRWIN.  Housing. CHAIR POWELL.  Oh , housing—the housing part of it.  Ye s, so we look at housing —of 
course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the Global F inancial C risis—they ’re not historically high, but the y’re much higher 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 23  
 than they ’ve been.  A nd you’ re seeing housing activity decline, and you’ re seeing housing prices 
growing at a faster rate and , in some parts of the country, declining.  You know, I would say 
housing was —the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the 
pandemic as demand increased and rates were low.   We all know the stories of how overheated 
the housing market was, prices going up.  Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of 
thing.  So the housing mar ket needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand.  
We’re well  aware of what ’s going on there.  From a financial stability standpoint, we didn ’t see 
in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the G lobal F inancial Cr isis.  
Housing credit was very carefully —much more carefully managed by the lenders .  So it’s a very 
different situation and doesn’ t present potential financial—doesn ’t appear to present financial 
stability issues.  But , no, we do understand that that ’s really where a very big effect of our 
policy is. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA .  Hi, Victoria Guid a with Politico.  I wanted to ask about the labor 
market.  You mentioned early on, again, that job openings are very high compared to available 
workers, and I ’m just curious to what extent you do and don’ t draw signal from that.  So, for 
example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings?  What do you see —are wages what ’s 
really important?  How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we talk a lot about vacancies in the— vacancy -to-unemployed 
rate, but it’ s just one, it ’s just another data series.  It’s been unusually important in this cycle 
because it ’s been so out of line.  But so has quits.  So have wages.  So we look at a very wide 
range of data on the unemployment —on the labor m arket.  So I’d start with unemployment , 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 23  
 which is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50 -year low, 3½ percent .  We’re 
getting really nothing in labor supply now.  We had , I think , very small increase this year , which 
we had really thought, we thought we would get that back.  Most analysts thought we would get 
some labor supply coming in. 
You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture.  
It’s true , with average hourly earnings , you see —so I would call  it a flattening out at a level 
that’s well  above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming 
a reasonable productivity.  With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture.  The headline 
number was a disappointment .  Let’s just say it was high.  It didn ’t show a decline.  There ’s 
some rays  of light inside that if you look at private -sector workers —that did come down, that 
compensation did come down.  Overall , though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor 
market where demand substantially exceeds supply.  Job creation still exceeds sort of the level 
that would hold the market where it is.  So that ’s the picture.  
Do we see—we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is 
happening.  And maybe that ’s there, but it ’s not obvious to me , because wages aren ’t coming 
down—they’ re just moving sideways at an elevated level, both E CI and average hourly earnings.  
We want to see—we wou ld love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down.  They are 
coming down.  V acancies are below their all -time high but not by as much as we thought , 
because—and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three.  So it ’s a mixed picture.  I don ’t see the case for real softening just yet.  But we look at, I 
guess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market.  
VICTORIA GUIDA .  So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation?  
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 23  
 CHAIR POWELL.  I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect 
on wages.  I think that’ s always been the case.  There ’s always—going back and forth, the 
question is , is that really elevated right now?  I don ’t think so.  I  don’ t think wages are the 
princi pal story of why prices are going up.  I don’ t think that.  I also don ’t think that we see a 
wage –price spiral, but , again, it ’s not something you can—once you see it, you’ re in trouble.  So 
we don’ t want to see it.  We wan t wages to go up —we just want them to go up at a level that ’s 
sustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation.  And we think we can —we do think that , 
given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as 
history would indicate through the unemployment channel.  It can soften through job openings 
declining .  We think there ’s room for that.  But we won ’t know that —that ’ll be, that ’ll be 
discovered empirically.  
KAYLA TAUSCHE.  Thank you so much.  Kayla Tausche f rom CNBC.  Earlier last 
month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn ’t 
change course.  The new U .K. prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there.  And 
I’m wondering how the F ed is weighing inter national developments in light of a very strong 
economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , of course , we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and 
also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad.  We’re in very frequent 
contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central b anks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers.  
So we ’re in touch with all of that.  So I guess what —it’s clearly a time, a difficult time in the 
global economy.  W e’re seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly be cause of high 
energy prices related to the war in Ukraine.  And we ’re seeing China ’s having issues with the 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 23  
 zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we ’re used to seeing.  So we ’re seeing —we 
see those difficulties.  T he strong dollar is a challenge fo r some countries.  But we haven’ t—we 
take all of that into account in our models .  We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing.  
Here in the United States , we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where 
inflation is running at 5 percent .  Core PCE inflation —which is a really good indicator of what ’s 
going on for us , the way we see it —is running at 5.1 percent on a 12- month basis and sort of 
similar to that on a 3- , 6-, and 9- month basis.  So we know that we need to use our tools to get 
inflation under control.  The world’ s not going to be better off if we fail to do that.  That ’s a task 
we need to do.  Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a 
long period of time.  Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy—for decades, hopefully—even though it may be difficult to get it back.  G etting it back is something 
that gives —that provides value to the people we serve for the long run.  
KAYLA TAUSCHE.  If I could just follow  up up on that —thank you.  The F ed has 
acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don’ t affect things like energy and food 
prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and they’ re some of the biggest pain 
points for consumers.  So as you pursue the current path that you’ ve outlined, is there a risk that 
some of those prices simply don’ t come down?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we don’ t directly affect , for the most part, food and energy prices, 
but the demand channel  does affect them just at the marg in.  The thing about the United States is 
that we also have strong —in many other jurisdictions , the principal  problem really is energy.  In 
the United States , we also have a demand issue.  We’ ve got an imbalance between demand and 
supply, which you see in many parts of the economy.  So our tools are well  suited to work on 
that problem, and that ’s what we ’re doing.  You ’re right, though.  W e don’ t—the price of oil is 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 23  
 set globally , and it ’s not something we can affect.  I think by the actions that we take , though, we 
help keep longer -term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent 
inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation 
is high.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jonnelle.  
JONNELLE MARTE.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.  So the F ed is 
facing two more ethics -related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from 
President Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event.  So some senators , like 
Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the F ed.  Could you 
talk about what this does to the public ’s trust in the bank and what the F ed is doing to prevent 
this kind of behavior from becoming common?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Sur e.  So you’ re right— the public ’s trust is really the F ed’s and any 
central bank ’s most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policymakers , violates or 
falls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriou sly.  We 
do.  So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday , actually, we had a C ommittee discussion of 
the full C ommittee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively 
accountable for knowing and following the high standard that ’s set out in our existing  rules with 
respect to both personal investment activities and external communications.  And we ’ve taken a 
number of steps , and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are.  I would 
say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually , it was 
through that that the problems with President Bostic ’s disclosures were discovered , when he filed 
his new disclosure .  We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into 
disclosures and follows them and approves people ’s disclosures and also all of their trades.  Any 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 23  
 trade anyone has to make is covered , has to be  approved, preapproved, and there ’s a lag —it has 
to be preapproved 45 days before it happens , so there ’s no ability to game market s.  So it’s a 
really good system .  It worked here.  And we —I think we all said to each other today —
yesterday , actually, yester day morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to 
hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems.  
JONNELLE MARTE.  Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t.  So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President 
Bostic to the inspector general , and once that happens, I don’ t discuss it with the i nspector 
general or with anybody.   It’s just —the inspector general has, he has the ability to do 
investigations .  We don’ t really have that.  So that ’s what he ’s doing. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  Earlier 
this year , you touted the three -month bi ll yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100 
percent expl anatory power.  And you said, quote , “If it’s inverted, that means the F ed’s going to 
cut, which means the economy is weak.”   That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion 
now, so I ’m wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened , particularly 
given that rates work with a lag.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so we do monitor the near -term forward spread —you’ re right.  
And it ’s—that ’s been our preferred measure.  We think, just empirically , it dominates the ones 
that people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that.  So it ’s not inverted.   And, also , 
you have to look at why things —why the rate curve is doing what it ’s doing.  It can be doing that 
because it affects— it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down.  In this case, if 
you’re in a situation where the markets are pricing in  significant declines in inflation, that ’s 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 23  
 going to affect the forward curve .  So, yes, we monitor it.  Y ou’re right.  And that’s what I 
would say.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could follow  up:  Y ou also said several meetings ago that the 
risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much.  Is what you’ re trying to tell us 
today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , what ’s happened is , time has passed , and we ’ve raised interest 
rates by 375 basis points.  I would not —I would not change a word in that statement , though.  I 
think until we get inflation down, you’ ll be hearing that from me.  Again, if we overtighten—and 
we don’ t want to, we want to get this exactly right —but if we overtighten, then we have the 
ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic 
episode, we can support economic acti vity strongly if that happens, if that ’s necessary.  On the 
other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it ’s a 
year or two down the road, and you’ re realizing , inflation behaving the way it can, you ’re 
realizing you didn’ t actually get it, you have to go back in.  By then, the risk , really , is that it has 
become entrenched in people ’s thinking.  A nd the record is that the employment costs —the cost 
to the people that we don’ t want to hurt—they go up with the passage of time.  That ’s really how 
I look at it.  So that isn ’t going to change.  What has changed , though—you’ re right —is, we’re 
farther along now.  And I think as we ’re farther along, we ’re now focused on t hat.  What’s the 
place, what ’s the level we need to get to rates?   And I don’ t know what we ’ll do when we get 
there, by the way.  I t doesn’ t—we ’ll have to see.  There ’s been no decision or discussion around 
exactly what steps we would take at that point.  But the first thing is to find your way there.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris Rugaber.

Page 19 of 23  
 CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Just to 
go back to housing for a minute :  You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on 
housing—h ome sales are down 25 percent in the past year , and so forth —but none of this is 
really showing up in, as you know, in the government ’s inflation measures.  And as we  go 
forward, private real -time data is clearly showing these hits to housing.  Are you going to need to 
put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there ’s overtightening going 
on, or will you still focus as much on the more lagg ing government indicators?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So this is an interesting subject.  So I start by saying, I guess , that the 
measure that ’s in the  CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases.  And 
that makes sense, actually , because fo r that reason —conceptually , that is —that ’s sort of the right 
target for monetary policy.  And the same thing is true for owners ’ equivalent rent , which comes 
off of —it’s a reweighting of tenant rents.  
The private measures are, of course , good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases, 
and they tell you a couple things .  One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of 
that series of the new leases, it ’s very pro- cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and 
PCE rents did.  And now they’ re coming down faster.  B ut what you’ re—the implication is that 
there are still , as people, as non -new leases roll  over and expire, right , they ’re still in the pipeline, 
there ’s still some significant rate increases coming , okay?  But at some point, once you get 
through that, the new leases are going to tell you —what they ’re telling you is , there will come a 
point at which rent inflation will start to come down.  B ut that point is well out from where we 
are now.  So we ’re well  aware of that , of course , and we look at it.  B ut I would say that in terms 
of—the right way to think about inflation , really , is to look at the measure that we do look at, but 
considering tha t we also know that at some point , you’ ll see rents coming down. 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 23  
 CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.   Great, and just a quick follow.  It looks like stock and 
bond markets are reacting positively to your announcement so far.  Is that something you wanted 
to see?  Is that  a problem or what —how that might affect your future policy to see this positive 
reaction?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ re not targeting any one or two particular things.  Our message 
should be —what I ’m trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think 
we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive.  And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step.  And that ’s meant to put that 
question, really , as the important one now , going forward.  
I’ve also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in Septe mber —the 
incoming data suggests that that ’s actually going to be higher , and that ’s been the pattern.  I 
mean , I would have little confidence that the forecast— if we made a forecast today, if we were 
doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that , one after  another , they go up , and that ’ll end when 
it ends, but there ’s no sense that inflation is coming down.  I f you look at the —I have a table of 
the last 12 months of 12- month readings , and there ’s really no pattern there.  We ’re exactly 
where we were a year ago.  S o I would also say, it ’s premature to discuss pausing.  And it ’s not 
something that we ’re thinking about .  That’s really not a conversation to be had now.  We have a 
ways to go. 
And the last thing I ’ll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to 
getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of 
withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon.  So those —I control those messages, and 
that’s my job.

 MICHELLE SMITH.   Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence with F ox Business.  T hank you, Fed 
Chairman.  So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve ’s 
trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader 
context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep 
spending even in—so I think those two things do tend to wage —to sort of counterbalance each 
other out.  It appears, consumer spending is still positive —it’s at pretty m odest growth levels .  
It’s not shrinking.  T he banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that 
the consumers are still buying and they ’re still— they’re fine .  So I don’ t know how big the fiscal 
headwinds are , and they haven’ t shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining 
spending.  So it must have to do with the savings that people have. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So, what about the spending?  There ’s tens of billions yet to 
be spent , I mean , from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act, 
bipartisan infrastructure bill.  H ow does that play  into your thinking about the future?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also 
from the strong demand that ’s still in the labor market.  We still see pretty significant demand 
and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall , I would say it ’s not 
really t ightening or loosening.  So we see those things , and what those things tell us is that our 
job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time.  We ’re going to have to stick 
with this.  And that ’s just —we take all that as a given , but we know what our objective is , and 
we know what our tools can do, and that ’s how we think about it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks .  We’ll go to Nancy for the last question.

 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer from 
Marketplace.  I ’m wondering, has the window for a soft landing narrowed?  Do you still think 
it’s possible? 
CHAIR POWELL.   Has it narrowed?   Yes.  Is it still possible?  Yes.  W e’ve always said 
it was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for 
longer , it becomes harder to see the path —it’s narrowed.  I would say the path has narrowed over 
the course of the last year, really.  Hard to say.  Hard to say.  Again, I would say that the sort of 
array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to—ordinarily there ’s a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into 
unemployment , or there ’s Okun’ s law.  So all those things are relationships that are in the data, 
and t hey’re very real.  Data ’s a little bit different this time , though, because you have this 
tremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge  curve.  
All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those 
traditional measures , because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so 
strong.  Again, that ’s going to be something we discover empirically.  I think no one knows 
whether there’ s going to be a recession or  not and,  if so, how bad that recession would be.  And 
our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over 
time.  And that ’s what we’ re going to do. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Just real quickly—why do you fee l like the window 
has narrowed?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Because we haven ’t seen inflation coming down.  The implication of 
inflation not coming down.  W hat we would expect by now to have seen is that as the —really , as 
the supply -side problems have resolved themselv es, we would have expected goods inflation to 
November 2, 2022   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 23  
 come down by now, long since by now.  And it really hasn ’t.  Actually , it has come down , but 
not to the extent that we had hoped.  At the same time, now you see services inflation, core 
services inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question.  That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive , and that narrows the path to a soft landing , I would say. 
Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
December 14 , 2022 
 
CHAIR POWELL .  Good afternoon .  Before I go into the details of today ’s meeting, I 
would like to underscore for the American people that we understand the hardship that high 
inflation is causing and that we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal .  Over the course of the year, we have tak en forceful actions to tighten the stance 
of monetary policy.  We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt.  Even so, we have more work to do.  Price stability is the responsibility 
of the Federal  Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy .  Without price stability, the 
economy doesn’ t work for anyone .  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a 
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
Today, the  FOMC  raised our policy interest rate by ½ percentage point .  We continue to 
anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time .  In addition, we are 
continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet .  Restoring price 
stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time .  I will have 
more to say about today ’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic 
developments.  
The U.S . economy has slowed significantly from last year ’s rapid pace.  Although real 
GDP  rose at a pace of 2.9 percent last quarter, it is roughly unchanged through the first three 
quarters of this y ear.  Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this 
quarter .  Growth in consumer spending has slowed from last year ’s rapid pace, in part reflecting 
lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions .  Activity in the housing sector has 
weakened significantly, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates .  Higher  interest rates and 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 23  
 slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment .  As shown in our 
Summary of Economic Projections, the median p rojection for real GDP growth stands at just 
0.5 percent this year and next, well below the median estimate of the longer -run normal 
growth rate.  
Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate near a 50- year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.  
Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month 
over the last three months .  Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace 
of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, 
with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers .  The labor force 
participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year .  FO MC participants expect 
supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing 
upward pressures on wages and prices .  The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment 
rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.  
Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent .  Over the 12 months 
ending in October, total PCE prices rose 6 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 5 percent .  In November, the 12- month change in the CPI was 
7.1 percent, and the change in the core CPI was 6 percent .  The inflation data received so far for 
October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases .  But it 
will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.  Price pressures remain evident across a broad range of goods and services.  Russia’ s war against Ukraine has boosted prices for energy and food and has contributed to 
upward pressure on inflation.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 23  
 5.6 percent this year and falls to 3.1 percent next year, 2.5 percent in 2024, and 2.1 percent in 
2025; participants continue to see risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. 
Despite elevated inflation, longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets.  But that is not grounds for complacency; the lo nger the 
current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.  
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the Amer ican people .  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highl y attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
At today’ s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
½ perc entage point, bringing the target range to 4 ¼ to 4½ percent .  And we are continuing the 
process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  
With today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 4 ¼ percentage points this year .  We 
continue to a nticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be 
appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time .  Over the course of the year, fi nancial conditions have tightened 
significantly in response to our policy actions .  Financial conditions fluctuate in the short term in 
response to many factors, but it is important that , over time , they reflect the policy restraint that 
we are putting in place to return inflation to 2 percent .  We are seeing the effects on demand in 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 23  
 the most interest -sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing .  It will take time, however, 
for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation .  In light of the 
cumulative tightening of monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects 
economic activity and inflation, the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 50 basis points today, a step -down from the  75 basis point pace seen over the previous four meetings .  Of 
course, 50 basis points is still a historically large increase, and we still have some ways to go.  
As shown in the SEP, the median projection for the appropriate level of the federal funds 
rate is 5.1 percent at the end of next year, ½ percentage point higher than projected in September .  
The median projection is 4.1 percent at the end of 2024 and 3.1 percent at the end of 2025, still above the median estimate of its longer -run value .  Of course , these projections do not represent 
a Committee decision or plan, and no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now .  Our decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and their 
implications for the outlook for  economic activity and inflation.  And we will continue to make 
our decisions meeting by meeting and communicate our thinking as clearly as possible. 
We are taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment 
with supply.  Our o verarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to our 
2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .  Reducing inflation 
is likely to require a sustained period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market 
conditions .  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum 
employment and stable prices over the longer run .  The historical record cautions strongly 
against prematurely loosening policy.  We will stay the course u ntil the job is done.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country .  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 23  
 Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -emplo yment and price -stability goals .  
Thank you.  I will look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Steve . 
STEVE LIESMAN .  Steve Liesman, CNBC .  Thanks for taking my question, 
Mr. Chairman .  You just talked about the importance of market conditions reflecting the policy 
restraint you put in place .  Since the November meeting, the 10- year has declined by 60 basis 
points, mortgage rates have come down, high- yield credit spreads have come in, the economy ’s 
accelerated, and the stock market ’s up 6 percent .  Is this loosening of financial conditions a 
problem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight , against inflation?   And, if so, do you need to do 
something about that?   And how would you do something about that?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions 
continue to reflect the policy restraint that we ’re putting in place to bring inflation down to 
2 percent .  We thi nk that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year .  But 
our policy actions work through financial conditions .  And those, in turn, affect economic 
activity, the labor market, and inflation .  So what we control is our policy moves i n the 
communications that we make .  Financial conditions both anticipate , and react to , our actions . 
I would add that our focus is not on short -term moves , but on persistent moves .  And 
many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time .  I would say it ’s our 
judgment today that we ’re not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say 
that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate .  And I would point you to the 
SEP again for our current assessment of what t hat peak level will be.  As you will have seen, 
19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or 
more —in the 5s .  So that ’s our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be.  
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 23  
 You will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we ’ve 
actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be .  And today we ’re—the SEP th at 
was published shows again that , overwhelmingly , FOMC participants believe that inflation ris ks 
are to the upside .  So I can ’t tell you confidently that we won’ t move up our estimate of the peak 
rate again at the next SEP .  I don’ t know what we ’ll do.  It will depend on future data .  What 
we’re writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be , based on 
what we know .  Obviously, if data —if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up .  
And it could move down if inflation data are softer.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Tim es.  Thanks for taking our 
questions .  The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the F ed will be making another 
¾ percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023 .  I wonder if you would foresee that being in 
25 basis point increments, 50 basis point inc rements —sort of how you see the speed playing out 
going forward.  And then I wonder what you’ re looking at as you determine when to stop. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, as I ’ve been saying, as we’ ve gone through the course of this 
year, as we lifted off and got into t he course of the year and we saw the— how strong inflation 
was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly.  In fact, the speed —the pace with 
which we ’re moving was the most important thing .  I think now that we ’re coming to the end of 
this ye ar, we ’ve raised 425 basis points this year , and we ’re into restrictive territory . 
It’s now not so important how fast we go.  It’ s far more important to think , what is the 
ultimate level?  And then it’ s—at a certain point, the question will become , how long do we 
remain restrictive ?  That will become the most important question .  But I would say the most 
important question now is no longer the speed.  So —and that applies to February as well .  So I 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 23  
 think we ’ll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial 
conditions, where we see the economy.  And that ’ll be the key thing, but —I mean, for that 
decision.  
But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we 
make looking at our progres s on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are , and making 
an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough .  [As] I ’ve told you today, we have an 
assessment that we’ re not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today ’s move .  And we ’ve 
laid out our own—our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there .  At a 
certain point, though, we ’ll get to that point.  And then the question will be , how long do we 
stay there ? 
And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we ’ll need to stay there, you know, 
until we ’re really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way.  And we think that 
that will be some time .  Now, why do I say that?   If you look at —you can break inflation down 
into three , sort of , buckets .  The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we ’ve been 
expecting, really , for a year and a half , that supply conditions would get better .  And, ultimately, 
supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a 
little bit.  And we start to see goods inflation coming down.  We’ re now starting to see that in 
this report and the last one . 
Then you go to housing services .  We know the story there is that housing services 
inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually.  A s rents expire and have 
to be renewed, they’ re going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were 
when the original leases were signed .  But we see that the new leases that are—that the rate for 
new leases is coming down .  So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 23  
 come down sometime next year .  The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the 
index, PCE core inflation index, is non- housing- related core services.  And that ’s really a 
function of the labor market, largely.  The biggest cost , by far , in that sector is labor.  And we do 
see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven’ t seen much softening, where job 
growth is very high, where wages are very high.  Vacancies are quite elevated , and, really, 
there ’s an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand.  So that part of it, which is 
the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down. 
The other —you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning 
at all for a year and a half .  Now it seems to be turning .  But there ’s an expectation, really, that 
the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we ’ll have to stay at it, so that w e 
may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go .  And that ’s really why we are 
writing down those high rates and why we ’re expecting that they ’ll have to remain high for 
a time . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Howard . 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters .  Thanks for taking the 
question.  You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe .  Yet it ’s 
really approaching stall speed .  Half a percentage point is not much .  You described labor market 
unemployment rate as represent ing some softening.  But it’ s nearly a full percentage point rise, 
and that ’s well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession .  Why wouldn’ t 
this be considered a recessionary projection by the F ed? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I ’ll tell you  what the projection is .  I don’ t think it would 
qualify as a recession, though, because you’ ve got positive growth.  The expectations in the SEP 
are basically as you said, which is, we ’ve got growth at a modest level, which is to say that 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 23  
 ½ percentage poi nt, that ’s positive growth.  It’ s slow growth.  It’ s well below trend .  It’s not 
going to feel like a boom .  It’s going to feel like very slow growth, right ? 
In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit .  Unemployment does go up 
a bit.  I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually 
elevated at this moment .  So it ’s not clear that those forecasts of  inflation are really much above 
the natural rate of unemployment.  We can never identify its location with great precision .  But 
that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market.  
If you look —you know, you’ ve got —the reports we get from the field are that companies 
are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story 
unto itself .  Generally , companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it ’s been 
very, very hard to hire .  So you’ ve got all these vacancies out there— far in excess of the number 
of employed people .  That doesn ’t sound like a —you know, a labor market where a lot of people 
will need to be put out of work.  So that we —you know, there are channels through which the 
labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe.  None of that is guarant eed, but that is what their forecast reflects . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Nick . 
NICK TIMIRAOS .  Thanks .  Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, I want 
to follow up on Jeanna ’s question.  The decision to step down the pace of rate increase —rate 
rises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports 
showed inflation decelerating in line with the C ommittee ’s forecasts this year .  You just now 
talked about making decisions meeting by meeting and being mindful of the lags of policy .  Does 
that mean, all things equal, you would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting?  
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 23  
 CHAIR POWELL .  So I haven’ t made a judgment on wha t size rate hike to make at the 
last meeting .  But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is , having moved so quickly 
and having now so much restraint that ’s still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing 
to do now is to move to a slower pace .  And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and—
you know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face .  So that ’s the 
idea.  It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me—particularly if you consider how far we ’ve come .  
But, again, I can’ t tell you today what the actual size of that will be .  It will depend on a variety 
of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of 
financial conditions .   
NICK TIMIRAOS .  With the CPI report, if it did come out last week, do you think it 
would have changed some of those forecasts in today’ s estimate?  
CHAIR POWELL .  No .  Absolutely not .  No .  As a —just a matter of practice, the SEP 
reflects any data that ’s—that comes out during the meeting.  And participants know that they 
have the —they know this —that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you 
know, well in advance of the press conference so that we’ re not running around.  But that ’s not 
the case.  It ’s never the case that  the SEPs don ’t reflect an important piece of data that came in 
on the first day of the meeting . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Rachel . 
RACHEL SIEGEL .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thank 
you for taking our questions .  I’m wondering if we could talk about the projection for the 
unemployment rate .  Why has the F ed raised its unemployment projection?   Is it because the 
model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 23  
 rate?  Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn ’t quite as strong as we think it is now?   
Thanks . 
CHAIR POWELL .  No .  It’s not about the strength of the labor market.  The labor market 
is clearly very strong.  It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected—we ’ve 
continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately.  And that ’s 
why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting.  You 
see that —you see the fact that we’ ve made less progress than  expected on inflation.  So that ’s 
why that goes up.  And that ’s why unemployment goes up, because we’ re having to tighten 
policy more .  And so it didn’ t go up by much in the meeting, I don’ t think .  But that ’s the idea , is 
slower progress on inflation, ti ghter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to 
get to where you—the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent . 
RACHEL SIEGEL .  Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of 
that could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming, or changes to the labor force 
population rate?  
CHAIR POWELL .  It’s very hard to say.  You know, there —you can look at history, 
right ?  And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like t his, the declines in 
unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there .  But 
why do we think that is the case?  So , I’ll give you a few reasons .  First just is that there ’s this 
huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that va cancies can come down a fair amount .  And we ’re 
hearing from many companies that they don’ t want to lay people off —so that they’ ll keep people 
because it ’s been so hard . 
I mean, I think we ’ve—it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there wher e 
there  are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 23  
 workforce available to work than there ’s demand for workforce .  So the fact that there’ s a strong 
labor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to worke rs.  And it means that it 
may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less .  Again, that 
we’re going to find out empirically .  But I think that ’s a reasonably possible outcome.  And you 
do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is .  So we ’ll see, though. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Colby. 
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  How should we 
interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP?   Does that not then suggest that 
the policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 medi an 
estimate penciled in?  
CHAIR POWELL .  Well, I think that’ s why one of the reasons it went up was that core 
came in stronger thi s year .  Yeah .  What you see is our best estimate, as of today—really, as of 
today—for how high we need to raise rates to— how much we need to tighten policy to create 
enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow —soften the labor 
market and bring inflation down through those channels .  That ’s all—that is the estimate —best 
estimate—we make today.  And, as I mentioned, we ’ll make another estimate for the next SEP .  
And we ’ll, you know, of course, between meetings, we do the same thing, but we don’ t 
publish it . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Victoria .   
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico .  I wanted to make sure I 
understand specifically what ’s going on in the SEP , because you all expect rates to go higher, but 
you’re also more pessim istic about what inflation is going to look like next year .  And I was just 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 23  
 wondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it —is that 
primarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwi nd? 
CHAIR POWELL .  We’ re going into next year with higher inflation than we had 
thought, right ?  So we’re actually moving down to—the level that we ’re moving down to next 
year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 
1 percent change in inflation .  But remember that the jump [ing]- off point at the beginning of the 
year is higher .  So, you know, we —we ’re moving down still by a very large chunk.  I don ’t think 
it’s having —I don’ t think the policy is having any less effect .  It’s just starting from a higher 
level at the end of 2022.  So we ’re getting down.  I believe the median is 3 ½ percent .  That 
would be —that ’s a pretty significant drop in inflation . 
And, you know, where ’s it coming from?   It’s coming from the goods sector, clearly.  By 
the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector .  
And then, you know, the big question is, when we —how much will you see from the largest, the 
55 percent of the index, which is the non- housing services sector ?  And, you know, that ’s where 
you need to see —we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in t he 
labor market so that you have —it’s not that we don’ t want wage increases.  We want strong 
wage increases.  We just want them to be at a level that ’s consistent with 2 percent inflation .  
Right now that —if you put into— if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity 
estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Neil . 
NEIL IRWIN .  Thanks .  Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios .  Some of your 
colleag ues have been pretty explicit that they can ’t imagine rate cuts happening in 2023.  That ’s 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 23  
 certainly not implied by the SEP .  But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back 
half of next year .  What ’s your view of the likelihood of any kind of r ate cuts next year?  What 
circumstances might make that plausible?  
CHAIR POWELL .  You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance 
to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time .  
It’s not on rate cuts.  And we think that we ’ll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for 
some time .  Historical experience caution s strongly against prematurely loosening policy .  I 
guess I would say it this way:  I wouldn’ t see us considering rate cu ts until the Committee is 
confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way.  So that ’s the test I 
would articulate .  And you’ re correct.  There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Steve .   
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg .  Let me ask you about China .  
In the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty 
strongly.  I’m wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you’ re seeing supply chains 
improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the  
global outlook for growth and for commodities prices .   
CHAIR POWELL .  So you’ re right .  Those two things will offset each other .  Weaker 
output in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains 
ultimately .  And that could push inflation up in the West .  It’s very hard to say, you know, how 
much—how those two will offset each other.  And it doesn ’t seem likely, actually, that the 
overall ne t effect would be material on us .  But, to your point, China faces a very challenging 
situation in reopening.  You know, we ’ve seen , waves of COVID all around the world can 
interfere with economic activity .  China, a very critical manufacturing —place for m anufacturing 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 23  
 and exporting.  Their supply chain is very important .  And China faces a reopening.  They ’ve—
you know, they’ ve backed away from their COVID r estriction policies .  There  could be very 
significant increases in COVID .  And we ’ll just have to see .  It’s a risky situation .  It—but, 
again, it doesn’ t seem like it ’s likely to have material overall effects on us . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Chris.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Hi .  Chris Rugaber, Associated Press.  Thank you for taking my 
question.  I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday’ s inflation report.  I 
mean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings .  
Are you starting to see —are you confident that you’ re seeing real progress on getting inflatio n 
under control?  Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know, 
upward spiral?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  Right .  So the data that we’ ve received so far for October and 
November, we don’ t have the —some of the —we have some remaining data to get in November, 
but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases .  As I 
mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained down ward path.  So the way we think about this is this:  This 
report is very much in line with what we ’ve been expecting and hoping for .  And what it does is , 
it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation . 
As I mentioned, we ’ve been expecting significant —forecasting significant declines in 
overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year .  And this is the kind of reading that it will 
take to support that .  So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than , at 
this point , changing our forecast .  In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation 
to come down as supply chain pressures eased .  That’s happening now .  Housing services —as I 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 23  
 mentioned, there ’s good news in the pipeline .  As long as hous ing—new housing leases show 
declining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year .  So that 
should help.  And the big piece, again, is core services, ex  housing, which is very important .  
And we have a ways to go there .  You do see some beginning signs there . 
But, ultimately, that ’s the big —the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index .  
And it ’s very fundamentally about the labor market and wages .  If you look at wages, look at the 
average hourly earnings number w e got with the last payrolls report, you don’ t really see much 
progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down.  Now, there may be composition 
effects and other effects in that.  So we don’ t put too much weight on any one report .  These 
things can be volatile month to month.  But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Michael McKee.   
MICHAEL MCKEE .  The re’s a—excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio 
and Television.  There ’s a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just 
expressed about the economy and the changes that you’ ve made in the SEP .  And I ’m wondering 
if you’ re reacting t o the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the 
Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we ’re seeing is 
transitory or not , and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you’ re projecting just 
½ percent growth for this year.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So if I—I think I got your question.  So, you know, one thing is to 
say is, I think our polic y’s in—getting into a pretty good place now .  We’ re restrictive, and I 
think we ’re—you know, we ’re getting close to that level of sufficient— we think—sufficiently 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 23  
 restrictive .  We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there .  And, I mean, it boils 
down to, how long do we think this process is going to take?  And, of course, we ’re—we 
welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months .  They ’re very welcome .  But I 
think we ’re realistic about the broader project .  So that ’s all.  That’s the point I would make . 
It’s—you know, we see goods prices coming down.  We understand what will happen 
with housing services .  But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there ’s not much 
progress there .  And that ’s going to take some time .  I think my view and my colleagues ’ view is 
that this will take some time .  We ’ll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained 
period so that, you know, two good—you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very 
welcome.  Of course, they’ re very welcome .  But we need to be honest with ourselves that 
there ’s, you know, inflation—12- month core inflation is 6 percent CPI .  That ’s three times our 
2 percent target .  Now, it ’s good to see progress .  But let ’s just understand we have a long ways 
to go to get back to price stability.  
MICHAEL MCKEE .  Well, do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable?  
CHAIR POWELL .  No, I wouldn’ t say that .  No .  I don’ t say that .  I mean, I would say 
this:  You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway.  But lower 
inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible .  So I just —I 
don’t think anyone knows whether we ’re going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether 
it’s going to be a deep one  or not .  It’s just , it’s not knowable .  And certainly, you know, lower 
inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a —
put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an  increase in 
unemployment than would be expected given the historical record.  
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 23  
 MICHELLE SMITH .  Brian . 
BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi, Chairman Powell.  Brian Ch eung, NBC News .  You warned 
Americans of pain earlier this year as the F ed hikes rates .  But with the Fed now  expected to 
raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that 
pain.  How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves —that ’d be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So the largest amount of pain —the worst pain would come from a 
failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high  in terms of 
employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the F ed didn’ t respond 
aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago.  So that ’s 
really —the worst pain would be if we failed to act . 
What we’ re doing now is, you know, it ’s raising interest rates for people .  And so people 
are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing.  There will be some softening in 
labor market conditions .  And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price 
stability .  There isn ’t.  And this is the best we can do .  I do think, though, that —and markets are 
pretty confident, it seems to me —that we will get in flation under control .  And I believe we will.  
We’re certainly highly committed to do that . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Grady.   
GRADY TRIMBLE .  Thank you, Mr . Chair .  Grady Trimble with Fox Business .  You ’ve 
reiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 23  
 target.  I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe 
increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is?  
CHAIR POWELL .  That ’s just —so , changing our inflation goal is just something we ’re 
not thinking about, and it ’s something we ’re not going to think about .  It’s—we have a 2 percent 
inflation goal, and we ’ll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent .  I think this isn ’t the time 
to be thinking about that .  I mean, there may be a longer -run project at some point.  But that is 
not where we are at all .  The Committee —we ’re not considering that .  We ’re not going to 
consider that under any circumstances .  We’ re going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent .  
We’re going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Nicole .   
NICOLE GOODKIND.  Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Nicole Goodkind, CNN 
Business.  As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you ’re paying close 
attention to a sector or even income level?  Like, how do you factor potential exacerbations of 
inequality into your risk calculations, especially given the K -shaped recovery of 2020?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So the —I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018, 
’19, ’20.  So , what that looked like was , wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the 
income spectrum were the largest .  The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at 
their smallest in reco rded history .  That ’s—and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight 
labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the 
economy growing right at its potential . 
So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the 
country, if we could get back to that .  And so that ’s what all of us want to do.  We want to get 
back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 23  
 time.  That ’s a really good thing for workers in the economy.  And we ’d love to get back to that .  
That’s what our goal is .  You know, there ’s—in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore 
price stability .  But we , you know, we can’ t—what we have to think about is the medium and 
longer term . 
If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time —I think much more 
difficult than we can think it would happen here .  But it really set up our economy for several 
decades of prosperity .  So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of 
the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time .  And so when it is lost, 
for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible—wh ich is what we’ re doing.  
NICOLE GOODKIND.  In the short  term, are you factoring in these exacerbations or 
potential exacerbations in the economy?  Are you monitoring them?  
CHAIR POWELL .  We do, yes .  We absolutely do.  We look at —it’s our regular practice 
to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of 
thing.  We do .  We keep our eye on that . 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Nancy. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  What 
would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong 
consistent signs that inflation is slowing—in other words, stagflation?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I don’ t want to get into too many hypotheticals .  But, you know, 
we’ll—it’s hard to deal with  hypotheticals .  So let me just say that we have to use our tools to 
support maximum employment and price stability .  I’ve made it clear that right now, the labor 
market’ s very, very strong.  You’re  near a 50 -year low where you’ re at or above maximum 
emplo yment , a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages —nominal wages 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 23  
 are very high.  So the labor market ’s very, very strong.  Where we’ re missing is on the inflation 
side.  And we ’re missing by a lot on the inflation side .  So that means we need to really focus on 
getting inflation under control, and that ’s what we’ ll do.  I think, as the economy heals, the two 
goals come more into play.  But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Greg . 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chairman Powell .  Greg Robb from MarketWatch .  You 
spoke a little bit ago.  You said that the U .S. looks —it looks like we have a structural labor 
shortage in the economy.  Could you expand on that , talk a little bit more about that?   And, 
really, are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing, like, legal immigration, 
things like that?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL .  So, what I meant by that, with “ structural labor shortage ,” is, if you 
look at where we are now, as I mentioned , there —if you just look at demand for labor, you can 
look at vacancies plus people who are actually working.  And then you can take supply of labor 
by, “A re you in the labor market? ”  “Are you looking for a job or have a job? ”  And you’ re 4—
more than 4 million people short .  We don’ t see— despite very high wages and an incredibly 
tight labor market, we don’ t see participation moving up —which is contrary to what we thought . 
So the upshot of all that is , the labor market is actually —it should —it’s 3½ million 
people , at least , smaller than it should have been based on pre -pandemic .  Just assume population 
and reasonable growth and aging of the population;  our labor force should be 3½ million more 
than it is .  And that —there’re lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back 
a few more years.  So why is that?   Part of it is just accelerated retirements .  People dropped out 
and aren ’t coming back at a higher rate than expected .  Part of it is that we lost a half a million 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 23  
 people who would have been work—close to half a million who would have been working died 
from COVID .  And part of it is that migration has been lower . 
We don’ t prescribe—you know, it ’s not our job to prescribe things .  But, you know, I 
think if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren’ t 
enough people .  We need more people .  So I tried to identify that in my —in a speech I gave a 
month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congre ss what to do because, you know, they gave us a 
job.  And we need to, you know, do that job.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thanks .  Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance .  You say you expect growth of just ½ percent next year .  Given that you’ ve said 
the process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful , have you had 
discussions within the Committee and addressed how long and/or how deep of a recession you 
would be willing to ac cept? 
CHAIR POWELL .  No .  I mean, what we do is , we make our forecasts, and we publish 
them quarterly .  And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow 
growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal.  And you see inflation coming down.  You see rates going up a lot .  You see inflation 
coming down.  Those are those forecasts, and that ’s really what they show . 
We’re not —of course, we don’ t talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that 
kind of a recession.  We just , you know, we make those forecasts .  The staff runs —and you will 
see this if you look at the old Tealbooks —runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at 
every meeting, and we look at those , too.  An d those will explore different things .  But that ’s 
just, you know, upside and downside scenarios .  Of course, that ’s a responsible practice that 
December 14 , 2022   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 23  
 we’ve carried on for many decades .  But, no, we don’ t—we haven ’t asked ourselves that 
question.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  We’ ll go to Jean for the last question.   
JEAN YUNG.  Hi .  Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to ask about the SEP again.  
If you’ re reaching peak rates around 5 percent in the first half of next year and inflation starts to 
decline materially, that w ould seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive .  Is that 
something that ’s built into the projections and into models?   Is that something you would want 
to see?  
CHAIR POWELL .  So we do know that .  Of course, that ’s something that we know we ’d 
see.  But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn’ t—I wouldn’ t see the Committee cutting rates 
until we ’re confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way.  That would be my test .  I 
don’t see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and 
what real rates are so that  it would mechanically happen like that .  It would—really , it’ll be a test 
of—for cutting rates, I think, in the event , it’ll be a question of , do we actually feel confident that 
inflation is coming down in a sustained way?  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
February 1 , 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL .  Good afternoon, and welcome.  My colleagues and I understand the 
hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back 
down to our 2 percent goal.  Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten th e 
stance of monetary policy.  We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid tightening so far are yet to be felt.  Even so, we have more work to do.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all . 
Today, the FOMC  raised our  policy interest rate b y 25 basis  point s.  We continue to 
anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary 
policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2  percent  over time .  In addition, we are 
continuing the process  of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  Restoring price 
stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time.  I will have more to 
say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic develop ments.  
The U.S. economy slow ed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below -trend 
pace of 1 percent.  R ecent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this 
quarter .  Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace , in part reflecting tighter 
financial conditions  over the past year .  Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, 
largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixe d investment . 
Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate at  a 50- year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated.  
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 23 
 Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month 
over the last three months .  Although t he pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past 
year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be 
out of balance.  Labor demand substantially exceed s the supply of available workers , and the 
labor force participation rate ha s change d little  from a year ago . 
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent.  The inflation data received over the past three 
months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases.  And, while recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. 
Despite elevat ed inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, a s 
well as measures from financial market s.  But that’s not grounds for complacency.  Alth ough 
inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high.  The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched . 
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our m andate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power , especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 23  
 At today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
25 basis point s, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4 ¾ percent.  And we are continuing the 
process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.  
With today’s action, we have raised interes t rates by 4 ½ percentage points over the past 
year.  W e continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds 
rate will be appropriate  in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently 
restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.  
We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest -sensitive 
sectors of the economy, particularly housi ng.  It will take time, however, for the full effects of 
monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.  In light of the cumulative tightening of 
monetary policy  and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation , 
the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step- down 
from last year’s rapid pace of increases.  Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the 
Committee to assess the economy ’s progress toward our goals as we de termine the extent of 
future increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive  stance.  We will continue 
to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and 
their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.  
We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better 
alignment with supply .  Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to 
our 2 percent goal and to keep longer -term inflation expectations well anchored .  Reducing 
inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market 
conditions.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 23  
 employment and st able prices over the longer  run.  The historical record cautions strongly 
against prematurely loosening policy.  We will stay the course, until the job is done . 
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  Thank you, 
and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris . 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.   Chris Rugaber, t he Associated Press.  T hank you for 
doing this.  As you know , financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields 
falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in 
January.  Does that make your job of combating inflation harder?  And could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial 
conditions?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect 
the policy restraint that we ’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent .  And , 
of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year.  I would say that our focus is not on short -term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial 
conditions.  And it is our judgment that we ’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, 
which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate.  Of course, many things affect financial conditions —not just our policy.  And we will take into account overall financial 
conditions along with many other factors as we se t policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.

Page 5 of 23  
 RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions.  Rachel Siegel 
from the Washington Post .  Over the last quarter, we ’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages, 
and a fall in consumer spending, all wh ile the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a 
historic low.  Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would 
need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you ’re looking for?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have 
seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market.   But I would also say that that 
disinflationary process that you now see under  way is really at an early stage.   What you see is, 
really , in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been 
fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated.  So you see that .  In 
the other —in the housing services sector , we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while 
but then to come down, assuming that  [rent increases associated with]  new leases continue to be 
lower.   So, in those two sectors, you’ ve got a good story.  The issue is that we have a large sector 
called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’ t see dis inflation yet.  But I 
would say that , so far , what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market 
conditions.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Has your —I’m sorry.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Go ahead.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go 
change d since December?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No.  We’ re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, 
and we ’ll see at that time.  I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 23  
 getting under  way, and we continue to get strong labor market data.  So —but, you know, we ’ll 
update those forecasts in March.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  You and some of your 
colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would 
let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses.  We saw the opposite in the December JOLTS this morning .  Job openings are actually rising.  That also coinci ded with 
slowdown in wage inflation.  Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So you’ re right about the data, of course .  What we did see—w e’ve 
seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated.  The job 
openings number has —in JOLTS, has been quite  volatile recently.  Yeah, I did see that it moved 
up—back up this morning.  I do think that it ’s probably an important indicator.  The ratio, I 
guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work.  So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we —you’ re right, we do see wages moving down.  If you 
look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation.  And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level .  So many, many—by many, many indicator s, the job 
market is still very strong.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby, and then Howard. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  Given the 
economic data since the December meeting , is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 23  
 recen t SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward?  Or does ongoing now mean more 
than two rate rises now?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So you’ re right.  At the December meeting, we all wrote down our 
best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that ’s obviously back in 
December.  And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent.  At the March meeting, 
we’re going to update those assessments.  We did not update them today.   We did, however, 
continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently 
restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent .  We think we ’ve covered a 
lot of ground, and financial conditions have  certainly tightened.  I would say we still think 
there ’s work to do there.  We haven ’t made a decision on exactly where that will be.   I think, you 
know, we ’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March 
meeting and then t he May meeting.  I don’ t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be.   It 
could certainly be higher than we ’re writing down right now.  If we come to the view that we 
need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December , we would 
certainly do that.  At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction , then we ’ll, you 
know, we ’ll make data -dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course. 
COLBY SMITH.   Just as a quick follow -up, how are you viewing the kind of bal ance of 
risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I guess I would say it this way.  I continue to think that it ’s very 
difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn’ t get the job done .  Inflation springs back , and we have to go back in.  And 
now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing.  This is a 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 23  
 very difficult risk to manage, whereas I —of course, we have no incentive and no desire to 
overtighten.  But we , you know, if we feel like we ’ve gone too far, we can certainly —and 
inflation is coming down faster than we expect , then we have tools that would work on that.  So I 
do think that , in this situation , where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, 
the job is not fully done.  As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 
56 percent  of the core inflation index where we don ’t see dis inflation yet.  So we don’ t see it.  
It’s not happening yet.  Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 pe rcent  on a 
6- and 12- month basis.  So there ’s not —nothing happening there.  In the other two sectors 
representing, you know, less than 50 percent,  you actually, I think, now have a story that is 
credible, that’ s coming together, although you don’ t actually  see dis inflation yet in housing 
services, but it ’s in the pipeline, right?  So, for the third sector, we don’ t see anything here.  So I 
think it would be premature —it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that 
we’ve really got this.  We n eed to see —our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down.  And how 
do we get that done?  There are many , many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they 
should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.  
But, so far, we don’ t see that.  And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work 
left to do.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual.  So 
I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here.  The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better.  You ’re saying inflation has eased  T hat’s new.  
You’ve ta ken out references to the war in Ukraine that ’s causing price increases.  You ’ve taken 
out references to the pandemic.   You ’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 23  
 being driven higher, yet that ’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy.  We still 
have ongoing increases to come.  So I ’m wondering, why is that the case?  And does it have 
more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a 
very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself  and overreact?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I would say it this way.  We can now say, I think, for the 
first time that the disinflationary process has started.  We can see that.  And we see it , really , in 
goods prices so far.  Goods prices is a big sector.   We—t his is what we thought would happen 
since the very beginning,  and now here it is actually happening, a nd for the reasons we thought .  
We—you know, it ’s supply chains, it ’s shortages, and it ’s demand revolving back towards 
services.  So this is a good thing.  This is a good thing.  But that’ s, you know, around a quarter of 
the PCE price index—core PCE price index.  So the second sector is housing services , and that ’s 
driven by very different things.  And we —as I mentioned , with housing services, we  expect , and 
other forecasters expect , that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but 
will then come down , assuming that  [rent increases associated with]  new leases continue to be 
soft.  And we do assume that.  So we think that that’ s sort of in the pipeline.  And we actually see 
disinflation in the goods sector , and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little 
less than half.   So this is good.  And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this 
is good.  We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core 
goods ex. housing—sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about.  We don’ t see 
it yet.  It ’s—you know, it ’s seven or eight different kinds of se rvices, not all of them are the 
same.  And, you know, we have a sense of what ’s going on in each of those different 
subsections.  Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent  of that is, you know, research 
would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 23  
 important.   Some of the other ones it ’s—the labor market is not going to be important.  Many 
other factors will drive it.   In any case, we don’ t see dis inflation in that sector yet.  And I think 
we need to see that it ’s the majority of the core PCE index , which is the thing that we think is the 
best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with ] our mandate.  
So it’s not tha t we’re not —we ’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic .  We’re just telling you that 
we don’ t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector.  I think we will fairly soon, but we 
don’t see it yet.  Until we do, I think we —you know, we see ourselves, we ’ve got to be honest 
with ourselves , but w e see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent —we’ll see more 
persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down.  And we ’re just going to  
have to—w e have to complete the job.  Y ou know, that ’s what we’ re here for.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, you observed 
several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above -target 
inflation.  And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high 
level despite a historically low unemployment rate.   Given that, and given how much you did 
over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed?   Why not stop here a nd 
see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’ve—you know, we ’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points , and 
we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately 
restrictiv e.  And why do we think that ’s probably necessary?   We think, because inflation is still 
running very hot .  We’ re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we ’re 
thinking about that.  It really —the story we ’re telling about inflation is to ourselves , and the way 
we understand it is basically the three things that I’ ve just gone through a couple of times.  And , 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 23  
 again, we don’ t see it affecting the services sector ex. housing yet.  But , I mean , I think our 
assessment is that we’ re not very f ar from that level.  We don ’t know that, though.  We don’ t 
know that.  So I think we ’re—you know, we ’re living in a world of significant uncertainty.   I 
would look across the rate —the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by —
you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve.  I think policy is 
restrictive.   We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough.  That ’s 
all.  And we ’re going to —you know, that ’s why we ’re slowing down to 25 basis points.  We’ re 
going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this 
meeting this week? 
CHAIR POWELL.  We—you know, you’ ll see that the minutes will come out in three 
weeks, and we ’ll give you a lot of detail.  I —you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the 
path ahead and the state of the economy.  And I wouldn’ t want to start to drive the —describe all 
the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion , was really talking quite a bit about the 
path forward. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling.  Given 
that w e’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U .S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do 
whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its 
own analysis of any legal constraints?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So your  question is, would we —say your question again.  
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 23  
 VICTORIA GUIDA.  Will the Fed do what T reasury directs as it relates to making 
payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  you’ re really asking about —you’ re asking about prioritization, in 
effect, is what — 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Yes.  Y es.  
CHAIR POWELL.  O kay.  So I feel like I have to say this.  There ’s only one way 
forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States 
governme nt can pay all of its obligations when due.  And any deviations from that path would be 
highly risky and that no one should assume that the F ed can protect the economy from the 
consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. 
In terms of our relationship  with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent .  And I’m just 
going to leave it at that.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the 
event that that would happen?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m just going to leave it at that.  This is a matter that’ s to be 
resolved between, really —it’s really Congress ’ job to raise the debt ceiling .  And I gather there 
are discussions happening, but they don’ t involve us.  We’ re not involved in those discussions.  
So we ’re the fiscal agent.  
MICHELLE  SMITH .  Jeanna  and then Steve .  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek  from the New York Times.  Thanks for taking our 
questions.  I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases 
and then restarting them?   Lorie Logan from th e Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 23  
 suggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech.   And I wonder if that view is broadly 
shared on the C ommittee.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the C ommittee obviously did not see this as the time to pause.  
We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points.  And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive 
monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent .  So that ’s the judgment that we 
made.  You know, we ’re going to write down new forecasts in March, a nd we ’ll—you know, 
we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Sorry , I should have been clear er.  I mean, would it be possible to 
take a meeting off, for example, and then resume?   You know, could you, rather th an just doing 
at every meeting that move , go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I mean, I think this is not something that the C ommittee is thinking 
about or exploring in any kind of detail.  In principle, though, you know, we used to —the thing 
we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember , 25 basis points, and that was 
considered a fast pace.   So I think a lot of options are available.  And I mean, you saw what the 
Bank of Canada did and, you know, they le ft it that they ’re willing to raise rates after pausing.  
But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, the S EP has the P CE 
inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent .  Meanwhile, the three- month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent , 
and you’ ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent  funds rate, which is what you have 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 23  
 penciled in for this year.  And you’ ve also achieved it witho ut the 1 percentage point increase in 
the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year.  I ’m wondering if you’ ve 
considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong, 
and it ’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge 
in unemployment.  
And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair 
Lael Brainard, who said, “ To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part 
for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors .”  In 
other words, it may not be wages.  The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control.  Than ks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So a couple of things.  First, on the forecast, if—you’ re right—i f you 
take very short -term three -month, say, measures of PCE —core PCE inflation, they ’re quite low 
right now.  But that ’s because that ’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from 
goods inflation.  Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer -run trend of 
something around zero, something like that.   So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go 
back up to 4  percent  by the middle of the year, for example.  So that ’s really where the 
sustainable level is.  It’s more like at 4  percent .  So that would suggest there ’s work left to do.  
You know, let ’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.  
As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data  dependent.  We would take that into 
account.  
In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services , as I mentioned earlier, it ’s a 
very diverse sector, six or seven sectors.  And so  sectors that represent 55 or 60  percent  of that—
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 23  
 subsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the 
labor market in a way, but som e of the other sectors are not.   And, for example, you know, 
financial services is a big sector that ’s really not driven by labor markets —wages.  So that ’s why 
I said there are a number of things that will affect—t ake restaurants, right?  So, clearly, labor is 
important for restaurants but so are food prices.   And, you know, transportation services is going 
to be driven by fuel prices, for example.  So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation.  I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you ’re not going to have, you 
know, a sustainable return to 2 percent  inflation in that sector without a better balance in the 
labor market.  And I don’ t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your 
question.  I do thi nk there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can 
soften.  And so far , we’ve got —as I mentioned, in goods , we have inflation moving down 
without the softening in the labor market.   I think most forecasters would say that unemployment 
will probably rise a bit from here.   But I still think —I continue to think that there ’s a path to 
getting inflation back down to 2 percent  without a really significant economic decline or a 
significant increase in unemployment.   And that ’s because the—you know, the setting we ’re in is 
quite different.  The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior —
you know, in prior business cycles.  And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the 
reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down.  And I think will—a  story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough.  But I think there is —
there’s ongoing disinflation , and we don’ t yet see weakening in the labor market.  So we ’ll have 
to see.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Can we get there with 5  percent ?  
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 23  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Certainly possible.  Yeah .  Absolutely it ’s possible.   You know, it ’s a 
question—no one really knows.  I think it ’s because this is not like the other business cycles in 
so many ways.  It may well be that as —yeah, as —that it will take more slowing than we 
expect —than I expect to get inflation down to 2  percent .  But I don’ t—that’s not my base case.  
My bas e case is that the economy can return to 2  percent  inflation without a really significant 
downturn or a really big increase in unemployment.  I think that ’s a possible outcome.   I think 
many, many forecasters would say it ’s not the most likely outcome .  But I would say there ’s a 
chance of it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio.  I ’d like to pick 
up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of 
your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there ’s still a lot of talk 
about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023.  And the recession indicators are all 
suggesting that we are going to see rec ession this year.  So I ’m wondering if you’ ve changed 
your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is 
going forward and whether you’ re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which 
calls for more restraint on your part.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I do think you—most forecast s and, you know, my own 
assessment would be that that growth will continue —positive growth will continue but at a 
subdued pace as it did last year.  We had growth of —GDP growth of 1 per cent last year and also 
final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator , of about 1  percent .  I think, you know, 
most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year.  There are other fa ctors, though, that need to be considered.  You will 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 23  
 have seen that the global picture is improving a bit , and that will matter for us, potentially.  The 
labor market remains very, very strong, and that ’s job creation , that’s wages.  As inflation does 
come  down, sentiment will improve.  You also—state and local governments are really flush 
these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending 
checks.  So I think that ’s going to support —they’re also spending a lot.  Ther e’s a lot of spending 
coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public.  And so that ’s going to support 
economic activity.  So I think there ’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive 
growth this year.  And that ’s my base case , is that there will be positive growth this year.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  O kay, Rich.  
RICH MILLER.  Thank you.  Rich Miller from Bloomberg.  First off, how are you 
doing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Fine .  Thanks.  Fine.  
RICH MILLER.  Good.  Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said 
you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down.  Can you give us some idea of what you’ re thinking of?  You mentioned three months —that we ’ve seen three months in 
a row.  Governor Wal ler suggested he might want to see six months.  And so  is it just the 
inflation data , or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have 
that “ substantially more evidence ” metric ? 
CHAIR POWELL.   So I don’ t think there ’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped 
or anything like that.  I think it ’s just an accumulating —accumulation of evidence.  So, of 
course, we ’ll be looking —by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment 
reports, two more CPI reports, and we ’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will.  A nd we ’ll 
be asking ourselves, what are they telling us?  And soon after that, we ’ll have another ECI wage 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 23  
 report, which, as you know , is a report that we like because it  adjusts  for composition and it ’s 
very complete.   And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some —was 
constructive.   It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level.  They ’re 
still at a level that’ s way above —well above where they were before the pandemic.  So I don’ t 
want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it ’s 
going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy 
over time.   But I will say, though, we —you know, it is our job to restore price stability and 
achieve 2 percent  inflation for the benefit of the American public.   We ’re not —market 
participants have a very different job.   It’s a fine job .  It’s a great job.   In fact, I did that job for 
years but in one form or another.  But, you know, we have to deliver that.  And so we are 
strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking 
the questions.  So you’ ve talked about we had solid job growth.  Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business, by the way.  We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer 
spending.  It seems so far it ’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to —from a 
9.1 percent  CPI inflation to 6.5  percent  CPI inflation.  Is the hard part yet to come to go from 
6.5 to 2?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t think we know, honestly.  You know, the —so we, of course, 
expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’ t come down all 
through ’ 22.  And now it ’s coming down, and it ’s come down pretty fast.   So I would say these 
are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 19 of 23  
 global pandemic and we shut the economy down a nd Congress did what it did and we did what 
we did.  It’ s just —it’s unique.  So I think certainty is ju st not appropriate here.  Inflation —it’s 
just harder to forecast inflation.   It may come down faster .  It may take longer to come down.  
And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target , and we will do that.   But I think 
we’re going to be caut ious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think 
that the game is won because, you know, it ’s—we ’ve got a long way to go.  It’ s just —it’s the 
early stages of disinflation.   And it ’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in 
disinflation, but that ’s great.  But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that 
it’s going to take some time .  That’s all.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Do you —how long do you see the n, the federal funds rate 
remaining at this elevated level?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, so—a gain, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you 
will see from the S EP and —I mean, there are many different forecasts, but , generally, it ’s a 
forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down 
steadily but not quickly.  And , in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those 
expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year.  Of course, other people have forecasts with i nflation coming down much faster, that ’s a different 
thing.  You know, if that happens —inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we ’ll be 
seeing that , and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Simon.  
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he 
Economist .  May I ask a further question about the language around “ ongoing increases ?”  T hat, 
of course, implies at least two further rate rises .  If you look at fed fund and  futures pricing, the 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 23  
 implication is that you ’ll raise rates one more time and then pause.  Are you concerned about that 
divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is 
largely due to the market ’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly.  I think 
that’s the bigger part of that.  So, again, as I just mentioned, we —you know, our forecasts —
different participants have  differe nt forecasts, but , generally, those forecasts are for continued 
subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession.  And we 
have inflation moving down, you know, into th e—somewhere in the mid -threes or maybe lower 
than that this year.  We ’ll update that in March, but that ’s what we thought in December.  
Markets are past that.  They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that.  
So we ’ll just have to see.  And we have a different view and —a different view, it ’s a different 
forecast, really.  And given our outlook, I just —I don’ t see us cutting rates this year if we get —if 
our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now.  If we do see inflation coming down much more 
quickly, that ’ll play into our policy s etting , of course.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Scott.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Scott Horsle y from NPR.  One of the changes in 
the statement this month is that the C ommittee is no longer listing public health as among the 
data points you’ ll conside r in assessing conditions.  What should we make of that?   Does the 
Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s the general sense of it.   Look, we understand —I personally 
understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it ’s no longer playing an important role in 
our economy.  And, you know, we ’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think 
we just —we knew we would take it out at some point.  There ’s never a perfect time , but we 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 23  
 thought  that—you know, people are handling it better , and the economy and the society are 
handling it better now.  It doesn’ t really need to be in a —you know, in the F ed’s monthly, you 
know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health 
issue.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy.  NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with 
Marketplace.  I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said recently.  She said she doesn ’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I ’m wondering if you agree 
with that.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I do.  Yeah, I do.  You don’ t see that yet.   But the whole point is, you 
know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem.  That means that , effectively, in 
people ’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue.  And once that happens —
that’s what we can ’t allow to happen.  And, you know, so that ’s why we worry that the longer 
we’re at this and the longer people are talking about  inflation all day long, every day, you know, 
the more risk of something like that.  But no, there ’s not much—i t’s more of a risk.  It always 
has been more of a risk than anything else.  By the way, I think it ’s becoming less salient.   And 
people are —you know, we pick that up in conversations.  And I ’ve seen some data, too, that 
show people are, you know, gradually—they’ re glad that inflation is coming down.  People 
really don’ t like inflation.  And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to 
economic activity.  You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’ re very, very low with 
3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards.  Why can that be?  It has to be inflation, right?   So I think once infla tion is seen to be 
coming down in coming months , even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope.  
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 23  
 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   So that ’s what you’ re looking at most closely, is 
consumer expectations?  
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, 
are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of 
the process of creating inflation.  That ’s a sort of bedrock belief .  In one way or another , it has to 
be.  We think it’ s important.  And , in this case, I would say , the risk eight months ago or so, 
longer -term inflation expectations had moved up.  We moved quite vigorously last year.  
Expectations are—seem to be well  anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the  longer 
end.  So it ’s, you know —and that ’s—I think that ’s very reassuring.  I think, you know, the 
markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 
2 percent  and it’ s just a matter of us following through .  That's immeasurably helpful to the 
process of getting inflation down.  The fact that people now do generally believe that it will 
come down, that ’ll be part of the process of getting it down.  And it ’s a very positive thing.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Greg.  
GREG ROBB.   Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  In the 
minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as important , when the C ommittee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of 
financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down.  I 
haven’ t seen —heard you talk much about that today or in the statement.  So I was wondering, 
has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you ’re concerned about?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  I would put it this way.  It ’s something that we monitor carefully.  
Financial conditions didn ’t really change much from the December meeting to now.  They 
February 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 23  
 mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place.  It’s important 
that the markets do reflect the tightening that we ’re putting in place.  As we ’ve discussed a 
couple times here, there ’s a difference in perspective b y some market measures on how fast 
inflation will come down.  We’ re just going to have to see.  I mean, I ’m not going to try to 
persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and 
some patience and that we’ ll need to keep rates higher for longer.  But we ’ll see.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Brendan, for the last question.  BRENDAN PEDERSEN.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News.  
I wanted to ask if the F ed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when i t comes to quantitative 
tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster to that drop- dead debt ceiling deadline .  Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop -dead 
deadline this summer?  
CHAIR P OWELL.   Look, I —it’s very hard to think about all the different possible 
ramifications.  And I think the answer is, basically, I don’ t think there ’s likely to be any 
important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting , and—as 
it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’ t risk, you know, the 
progress we ’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector.  I believe that 
that will happen.  I believe it will happen.  You know, we, of course, will monitor money market conditions carefully as —you know, as the process moves on.  For example, the T reasury G eneral 
Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up.  And we understand there ’ll be lots of 
flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves.   We understand all that.  We’re 
watching it carefully.  We’ll just be monitoring it.  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
March 2 2, 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  Before discussing today’s meeting, let me briefly 
address recent developments in the banking sector.  In the past two weeks, serious difficulties at 
a small number of banks have emerged.  History has shown that isolated banking problems, i f 
left unaddressed, can undermine confidence in healthy banks and threaten the ability of the banking system as a whole to play  its vital role in supporting the savings and credit needs of 
households and businesses.  That is why, in response to these event s, the Federal Reserve, 
working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC, took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen public confidence in our banking system.  These actions demonstrate that all depositors ’ savings and the banking system are safe.  With the support of the Treasury, 
the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program to ensure that banks that 
hold safe and liquid assets can, if needed, borrow reserves against those assets at par.  This program, along with our long- standing discount window, is effectively meeting the unusual 
funding needs that some banks have faced and makes clear that ample liquidity in the system is available.  
Our banking system is sound and resilient, with strong capital and liquidity.  We will 
continue to closely monitor conditions in the banking system and are prepared to use all of our tools as needed to keep it safe and sound.  In addition, we are committed to learning the lessons from this episode and to work to prevent episodes —even ts like th is from happening again.  
Turning to the broader economy and monetary policy :  Inflation remains too high, and 
the labor market continues to be very tight.  My  colleagues and I understand the hardship that 
high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.  Without price 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 23 
 stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will 
not ac hieve a sustained period of long —of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP  rising at a below -trend 
pace of 0.9 percent.  Consumer spending appears to have picked up this quarter, although some of that strength may reflect the effects of swings in the weather across the turn of the year.  In contrast, activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates and slower output growth al so appear to be weighing on business fixed 
investment. 
Committee participants generally expect subdued growth to continue.  As shown in our 
Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for real GDP growth stands at just 0.4 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.  And nearly all participants see the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside. 
Yet the labor market remains extremely tight.  Job gains have picked up in recent months, 
with employment rising by an average of 351,000 jobs per month over the last three months.  
The unemployment rate remained low in February at 3.6 percent.  T he labor force participation 
rate has edged up in recent months, and wage growth has shown some signs of easing.  However, 
with job vacancies still very high, l abor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available 
workers.  FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.  The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises to 4.5 percent at the end of this year and 4.6 percent at the end of next year. 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 23  
 Inflation remains well above our longer- run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in January, total PCE prices rose 5.4 percent ; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories.  Core PCE —excluding those , core PCE  prices rose 4.7 percent.  In February, the 
12-month change in the CPI came in at 6 percent, and the chang e in the core CPI was 
5.5 percent.  Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, but the strength of 
these recent readings indicates that inflation pressures continue to run high.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation  is 3.3 percent for this year, 2.5 percent next year, 
and 2.1 percent in 2025.  The process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy. 
Despite elevated inflation , longer -term inflation expectations appear to  remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable pri ces for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportati on.  We 
are highly attentive  to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
At today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal fun ds rate by 
¼ percentage point, bringing the target  range to 4¾  to 5 percent.  And we are continuing the 
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  
Since our previous FOMC meeting, economic indicators have generally come in stronger 
than expected, demonstrating greater momentum in economic activity and inflation.  We believe, 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 23  
 however, that events in the banking system over  the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter 
credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.  
It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects and therefore too soon to tell how monetary 
policy should respond.  As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation; instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.  We will closely monitor incoming data and carefully assess the actual and expected effects of tighter credit conditions on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, and our policy decisions will reflect that assessment.  
In our SEP, each FOMC participant wrote down an appropriate path for the federal funds 
rate based on what that participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.  If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.3 percent at the end of 2024, and 
3.1 percent at the end of 2025.  These are little changed fr om our December projections, 
reflecting offsetting factors.  These projections  are not a Committee decision or plan; if the 
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  We will continue to make our meeting —
decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the v incoming data and their implications 
for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.  
We remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep 
longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is likely to require a period 
of below -trend growth and some softening in  labor market conditions.  Restoring price stability 
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.

 To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stabili ty goals.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Colby. 
COLBY SMITH.   Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  How confident is 
the Committee that the recent stress that we ’ve seen, and you’ ve alluded to, is contained at this 
point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Thanks .  So I, I guess our view is that the banking system is sound 
and it ’s resilient —it’s got strong capital [and] liquidity.   We took powerful actions wit h [the] 
Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors ’ savings are safe and that the 
banking system is safe.  Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week.  
And the last thing I ’ll say is that we ’ve undertaken—we ’re undertaking a thorough internal 
review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation.  
COLBY SMITH.   Okay, just a quick follow -up:  I mean , given all the stress and the 
uncertainty that you’ ve also alluded to in the statement, how seriously was a —was a pause 
considered for this meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So we considered —we did consider that in the days running up to the 
meeting , and you see the decision that we made, which I ’ll say a couple things about.   First, it 
was supported by a very strong consensus , and I ’ll be happy to explain why.  A nd, really , it is 
that the intermeeting data on inflation and the labor market came in stronger than expected and, really, before the recent events, we were clearly on track to cont inue with ongoing rate hikes.  In 
fact, as of a couple of weeks ago, it looked like we ’d need to raise rates over the course of the 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 23  
 year more than we had expected at the time of the SEP in December —at the time of the 
December meeting.  We are committed to restoring price stability , and all of the evidence says 
that the public has confidence that we will do so —that we ’ll bring inflation down to 2 percent 
over time.   It is important that we sustain that confidence with our actions as well as our words.  
So we also assess, as I mentioned, that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result 
in some tightening credit conditions for households and businesses and thereby weigh on 
demand, on the labor market , and on inflation.  Such a tightening in financial conditions would 
work in the same direction as rate tightening.  In principle , as a matter of fact, you can think of it 
as being the equivalent of a rate hike or perhaps more than that ; of course , it’s not possible to 
make that assessment today with any pr ecision whatsoever.   So our decision was to move ahead 
with the 25 basis point hike and to change our guidance, as I mentioned, from ongoing hikes to some , some  additional hikes maybe —some policy firming may be appropriate.  So going 
forward, as I mentione d, in assessing the need for , for further hikes, we ’ll be focused as always 
on the incoming data and the evolving outlook and, in particular , on our assessment of the actual 
and expected effects of credit tightening. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.   Mr. Chairman, can you explain the difference between ongoing rate 
increases and firming ?  Does firming imply a rate increase per se, or could policy firm without 
you increasing rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think it ’s, it’s meant to refer to our policy rate.  Really , I would 
focus on, on  the wor ds “may” and “ some, ” as opposed to “ ongoing.”   Ongoing.  So we , we 
clearly were —what we were doing there was taking onboard the —trying to reflect the 
uncertainty about what will happen.   I mean , it, it’s possible that this will turn out to have very 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 23  
 modest effects—that these events will turn out to be very, very modest effects on the economy, 
in which case inflation will continue to be strong —in which case, you know , the path will look —
might look differe nt.  It ’s also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant 
tightening in credit conditions over time and, in principle, if that—that means that monetary policy may have less work to do.  We simply don ’t know.  So.  
STEVE LIESMAN.   Do you have concerns th at the recent —that the hike you did today 
could further exacerbate the problem in the banks?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No .  I mean , with our monetary policy, we’re , we’re really focused 
on macroeconomic outcomes .  In particular , we’re focused on , on this potential credit tightening 
and what can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions.  I think when we think about the situation with the banks, we ’re focused on our —on our  financial stability tools , in particular 
our lending facilities, the debt —sorry, the discount window , and also the new facility.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, in your 
testimony two weeks ago, you had indicated you thought the terminal rate would be higher.  
Obviously, that was before the stress in the banking sector.  And I realize there ’s a lot of 
uncertainty, but can you —can you explain at all to what extent your forecasts or those of your 
colleagues or those of the Board staff incorporated today a material tightening of credit availability because of the stress in the banking sector , or are you waiting to see it in the data 
before you incorporate that potential tightening into your forecasts?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know , we have just come fr om an FOMC meeting and, you 
know , the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting, but I’ ll tell you what I 
heard .  What I heard was significant number of people saying that they anticipated there would 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 23  
 be some , some  tightening of credit c onditions and that would really have the same e ffects as, as 
our policies do, a nd that therefore  they were including that in their assessment and that if that did 
turn out not to be the case, in principle you would need more rate hikes.  So some people did 
reflect that in their FOMC—in their SEP forecasts.  I think there may also just have been —
rememb er, this is 12 days ago.  Y ou know , we’re trying to assess something that just is so recent 
and it ’s people —you know , it’s very difficult, there ’s so much uncertainty.  So  December was a 
good place to start , and we wound up with—we wound up with very simil ar outcomes for 
December.  And, you know , in a way, the early— the data in the first part —the first five weeks of 
the intermeeting period pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor market s.  So that pointed 
to higher rates .  And then this , this latter part kind of —the possibility of credit conditions 
tightening really, really offset that, effectively.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  To follow  up:  H ave you considered at all whether your primary tool, 
the funds rate, is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighte r financial conditions that you 
believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector?  Have you, for example, considered changing reserve requirements, selling assets out of the S ystem O pen 
Market A ccount, as a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don’ t accelerate 
deposit erosion, for example , from banks?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Y ou know , we know that we have other , other  tools in effect, but no, 
we think our monetary policy tool works , and we think, you know , many, many banks —our rate 
hikes were well  telegraphed to the market , and many banks have managed to handle them.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.   I wanted to ask —you, along 
with the FDIC and the Treasury—t he Fed Board decided to invoke the systemic risk exception to 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 23  
 allow uninsured depositors to be protected at these two banks.  I was just wondering if you could 
speak to why that decision was made.  Was it purely a confidence issue, or was there a concern that there would be some sort of economic contagion or financial contagion from the failure of 
these banks?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The issue was really not about those specific banks, but about the 
risk of a contagion to, to  other banks and to the financial market s more broadly.  That was the 
issue.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Okay, and then can you also—just to follow  up, can you speak to 
the role that you will be playing in the F ed’s internal investigation on its supervision and 
regulation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So Vice Chair Barr is, is of course leading that review.  And he ’s 
responsible for it in his capacity as Vice Chair for Supervision.  We—I realized , you know , right 
away that , that there was going to be a need for review.  I mean , the question we ’re all asking 
ourselves  over that first weekend was, how did this happen?  And so what we did was, early 
Monday morning, we sat down and said, “L et’s do this .”  And he, he was obviously going to lead 
it in his capacity.  So I don’ t—my role was to announce it , and I get briefed on it , but I ’m not 
involved in, in the work of it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.  HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Howard Schneider from Reuters.   So I 
want to go back to your February press conference .  You mentioned the word “disinflation ,” I 
believe, 9 or 10 times, a process that you felt was—I forget the word you used—but gratefully under  way , or something like that.  Is disinflation still occurring in the U.S. today?  
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 23  
 CHAIR POWELL.   Yes .  I mean, what actually happened, Howard, was I got the 
question 12 times, so it’s —maybe it ’s a feature, not a bug.  But , so, but yeah, absolutely the 
same— the story is intact , so it ’s really three parts, right?  Goods inflation has been coming down 
now for six months ; it’s proceeding more slowly than we would have liked, but it ’s certainly 
proceeding.  Housing services is, is  really a matter of time passing .  We continue to see the new 
leases being signed at much lower levels of inflation.  So that ’s 44 percent of the —of the core 
PCE index, where you’ ve got  a story that ’s ongoing.  Wh ere we didn’ t have in February, and we 
still don ’t have now, is a sign of progress in the nonhousing services sector.  And that is, you 
know , that ’s just something that will have to come through softening demand and perhaps some 
softening in labor market conditions .  We don’ t see that yet.   And that’s, that’s of course 
56 percent of the index.  So the story is pretty much the same.  I will say that the inflation data 
that we got, to your point, really pointed to stronger inflation.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  If I could follow  up on that, I was curious why you don’ t see 
more coming from the credit crunch , because it seems to me that ’s something that you’d  actually 
welcome to a degree and expect.  And are you not seeing more coming from that because you 
don’t know, or because you just don’ t want to have another round of wishful thinking?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s really just a question of not knowing at this point.  There ’s a 
great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions, economic activity, 
hiring, and inflation.  Very large body of literature.  The question is, how significant will this 
credit tightening be and how sustainable it will be ?  That ’s, that’s the issue.  And we don’ t really 
see it yet, so , so people are making estimates, you know , people are publishing estimates , but it ’s 
very kind of rule -of-thumb guesswork almost at this point.  But we think  it’s, it’s potentially 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 23  
 quite real and that argues for, you know , being alert as we go forward .  As we think about further 
rate hikes for us, we’ ll be paying attention to the actual and expected effects from that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek  from the New York Times.  
Thank you for taking our questions.  I wonder if you could talk a little bit —I know that you’ ve 
got your internal review coming, but I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think happened with oversight at Silicon Valley Bank and whether thi s suggests that something about 
regulation and supervision needs to actual ly change going forward.  And I wonder, you know , 
how can the American people have confidence that there aren ’t other weaknesses out there in the 
banking system, given that this one got missed, as you noted?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say what , what I think happened, and then I ’ll come to the 
questions around supervision.  So, at a basic level, Silicon Valley Bank management failed 
badly—they grew the bank very quickly, they expose d the bank to significant liquidity risk and 
interest rate risk, didn ’t hedge that risk.  We now know that supervisors saw these risks and, and 
intervened.  We know that the public saw all this.  We know that SVB experienced an 
unprecedentedly rapid and mas sive bank run.  So this is a —this is a very large group of 
connected depositors —concentrated group of connected depositors in a very, very fast run, faster 
than historical record would suggest.  So as for us —so for our part, we ’re doing a review of 
supervi sion and regulation.  M y only interest is that we identify what went wrong here.  How did 
this happen is the question.  What went wrong?   Try to find that.  We will find that.  And then 
make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so t hat it doesn ’t happen again, 
and then implement those policies.  It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my 
views on what the answers might be.  You know , I simply can ’t do that.  Vice Chair Barr is 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 23  
 leading this, and I think he ’s testifying  next week.  So —but that will be up to him.  So that ’s 
really where it is .  You know , the, the review is going to be thorough and transparent.  It is 
clear —really to your last question— it’s clear that we do need to strengthen supervision and 
regulation.  And I , I assume that there will be recommendations coming out of the report, and I , I 
plan on supporting them and supporting their implementation.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  And the final point —you know , can we feel confident that these 
weaknesses don ’t exist elsew here, given that they got missed at this bank?  
CHAIR POWELL.  These are not weaknesses that are—that are at all broadly through 
the banking system.  This was—this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its 
percentage of , of uninsured deposits and in terms of its holdings of duration risk.  And again, 
supervisors did get in there , and, and they were, as you know , obviously, you know they were —
they were on this issue, but nonetheless, this , this  still happened.  And so that ’s really the nature 
of the  interview —sorry, of the review —is to discover that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  You ’ve 
been very consistent in saying that the F ed would be raising interest rates and then holding them 
there for quite some time.  Following today’ s decision, the markets have now priced in one more 
increase in May , and then every meeting the rest of this year they ’re pricing in rate cuts.  Are 
they getting this totally wrong from the Fed, or is there something different about the way you’ re 
looking at it, given that you’ re now thinking that moves might be appropriate as opposed to 
ongoing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we published an SEP today, as you will have seen, and it shows 
that basically participants expect relatively slow growth, a gradual rebalancing of supply and 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 23  
 demand in the  labor market, with inflation moving down gradually.  In that most likely  case, if 
that happens, participants don’ t see rate cuts this year.  They just don’ t.  I would just say:  A s 
always, the path of the economy is uncertain, and policy is going to reflect what actually happens 
rather than what we write down in the SEP.  But that ’s not our baseline expectation.  
MICHAEL  MCKEE.  Well , if I could follow  up and ask, as you look forward into the 
rest of the year here, are you saying that what you see and the 5.1 percent basically consensus is based on being—it will be sufficiently restrictive?  Or is it leavened by the idea of you don’ t 
know what's going to happen?  In other words, what should people think about in terms of how the F ed thinks about how far it is from the terminal?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It’ s going to depend.  R emember, we ’re looking—for purposes of 
our monetary polic y tool , we’re looking at what ’s happening among the banks and asking, is 
there going to be some tightening in credit conditions ?  And then we ’re thinking about that as 
effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do.  So , in a way, that substitutes for rate hikes. 
So, the key is, we have to have —policy has got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 
2 percent over time.  It doesn ’t all have to come from rate hikes :  It can come from , you know , 
from tighter credit con ditions.  So we ’re looking at, and we , we—it’s highly uncertain how long 
the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those e ffects would be, so we ’re just 
going to have to watch.  In the meantime, you know —obviously, at the end of the day, we  will 
do enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent.  No one should doubt that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Rachel Siegel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thank 
you for taking our questions.  I know we ’ve tal ked a bit about how Silicon Valley Bank was 
unique to a certain sector of the economy, but there ’s also growing concern that there are 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 23  
 financial stability risks from the commercial  real estate market and loans that will begin to roll 
over later this year a nd next, and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those 
loans.  Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of —what we saw with SVB to banks that 
disproportionately are focused in commercial real estate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , you know , we’re well  aware of the concentrations people have in 
commercial real estate .  I really don’ t think it ’s comparable to this.  The, the banking system is , 
is strong, it is sound, it is resilient, it ’s well  capitalized , and I really don ’t see that as at all 
analogous to this.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And one other question :  Would you be open to an independent 
investigation, separate from the F ed’s probe?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I welcome—it ’s 100 percent certainty that there will be independent 
investigations and outside invest igations and all that.  So we welcome— when a bank fails, there 
are investigations .  And, of course , we welcome that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from F ox 
Business.  Inflation has been rather sticky , so do you need help from the fiscal side to get 
inflation down faster?  
CHAIR POWELL.   We don’ t assume that.  We don ’t give advice to the fiscal authorities, 
and we assume that —we take fiscal policy as, as it comes to our front door, s tick it in our model 
along with a million other things .  We have responsibility for price stability.  The Federal 
Reserve has responsibility for that.  And nothing’ s going to change that.  So—and we will get 
inflation down to 2 percent in time.  
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 23  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE.  And if I  can follow on that, but they’ re working—the 
spending that ’s happened is working against what you are doing, right?  So it ’s prolonging 
inflation.  
CHAIR POWELL.  You have to look at , at the impulse from spending because spending 
was, of course , tremendousl y high during the pandemic , and then, as the pandemic programs 
rolled off, spending actually came down, so the —this sort of fiscal impulse is actually not what’ s 
driving inflation right now.  It was —it was at the beginning perhaps part of what was driving 
inflation, but that ’s not really the story now. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Neil Irwin.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.   Two questions about aspects of 
the government ’s response on Silicon Valley Bank two weekends ago.  First, why i s this new 
bank funding facility done under e mergency 13 (3) authority,  as opposed to expansion of the 
discount window, changing the terms of the discount window that ’s been around a long time?  
And, second, can you discuss the Fed ’s role in the —in the  FDIC guarantee of uninsured 
depositors and why there ’s $143 billion on your balance sheet s last week, supporting that deposit 
guarantee?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So 13( 3) seemed like the right —we have a little more 
flexibility under s ection 13( 3).  We ’ve done quite a lot under the discount window as well.  We 
needed to do a special facility that was designed a certain way , so we did it under 13( 3).  Really 
no magic to that.  It’s only available in unusual and exigent circumstances , and it has to be—
meet certain requirements, but it seemed to be the right place.   So with the FDIC, w e’re just, 
we’re lending to the, in effect, we ’re—we’re lending to the bridge bank.  So that ’s where the 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 23  
 funds came from , and it ’s—it’s  a loan that ’s 100 percent guaranteed by the FDIC, so there ’s no 
risk in it for us.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, Chris Rugaber.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  The SEB —SEP 
suggests one more rate hike , as does the change in the language in the statement  and which 
suggests that you’ re perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hik es.  Do you feel , though, that if 
inflation remains high, you’ ll be able to resume additional hikes as needed , or have you 
somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end?  Thank 
you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, absolutely not.  No,  we, if we need to raise hike —raise rates 
higher, we will.  I think for now though we , we—as I’ve mentioned , we see the likelihood of , of 
credit tightening.  We know that can have, you know , an effect on the macroeconomy, on 
demand, on labor market, on inflation, and we ’re—we’re  going to be watching to see what that 
is.  And we ’ll also be watching what ’s happening with inflation and in the labor market.  So  
we’ll be watching all those things , and of course we will —we will eventually get to [a] tight 
enough policy to bring inflation down to 2 percent.  We’ ll find ourselves at that place.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.   Hi, Chair Powell—thanks for taking the question.  Kyle Campbell 
with American Banker.   I have a couple questions about the balance sheet.  First of all, I’ m 
curious at what point the financial supports that the Fed  is extending through the discount 
window and through its enhanced lending facility might be at odds with the objective of reduci ng 
the balance sheet.  And I ’m also curious what your thoughts are on the —not just the availability 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 23  
 of reserves but the distribution of them throughout the banking system and at what point you 
might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So —People think of QE and QT in different ways, so let me be clear 
about how I ’m thinking about these recent developments.  So the recent liquidity provision that 
has increased the size of our balance sheet but the intent and the effects of it are very different from what we —from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer -term 
securities.  Large -scale purchases of long -term securities are , are really meant to alter the stance 
of policy by pushing down—pushing up the price and down the rates, longer -term rates, which 
supports demand through channels we understand fairly well.  The balance sheet expansion is really temporary lending to banks to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions ; it’s not inte nded to directly alter the stance of monetary policy.  We do believe that it ’s 
working.  I t’s having its intended effect of bolstering confidence in the banking system and 
thereby forestalling what might otherwise have been an abrupt and outsized tightening in 
financial conditions.  So that ’s working. 
In terms of the distribution of reserves, we , we don’ t see ourselves as, as running into 
reserve shortages.  W e, we think that our program of allowing our balance sheet to , to run off 
predictably , predicatbly  and passively is working.  And of course we’re , we’re always prepared 
to, to change that if that changes.  B ut we don’ t see any evidence that that ’s changed.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Catarina.  
CATARINA SARAIVA.  Hi , Chair.  Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.  The 
minutes of the January– February meeting, the last meeting, indicate that you discussed the 
possibility of runs on nonbank financial institutions and the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios.  Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion —kind of what was talked 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 23  
 about in light of that, and then why didn’ t the Fed , you know , do anything about that at that point 
to ultimately prevent, you know , what happened this month?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I mean, to be honest, I don ’t—I don’t recall the specifics of that.  It’ s 
been  quite an interesting seven weeks.  But , but I will tell you , though, that we have —there have 
been presentations about , about interest rate risk.  I mean , it’s been in all the newspapers.  I t’s not 
a surprise that th ere are institutions that have —that have had unhedged long positions in long-
duration securities that have lost value as, as longer -term rates have gone up due to our rate 
increases.  So that ’s, that’s  not a surprise.   I, I think, as you know, as  is now in  the public record, 
the supervisory team was apparently engaged, very much engaged with the bank repeatedly, and 
was escalating but , you know , nonetheless, what happened happened.  A nd so that ’s really the 
purpose of —one way to think about the review that Vice Chair Barr is conducting is to try to 
understand how that happened and try to understand how we can do better and what policies we 
need to change.  I mean , one thing is the speed of the —I’ll come back to that, the speed of the 
run, it ’s very diff erent from what we ’ve seen in the past , and it does kind of suggest that there ’s a 
need for possible , you know , regulatory and supervisory changes just because supervision and 
regulation need to keep up with what’s , what ’s happening in the world.  
CATARINA SARAIVA.  Can you confirm whether or not the Board knew about these 
escalations by the examiners in San Francisco?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I will have to come back to you on that.  Yeah, I don’ t know. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Hi .  Simon Rabinovit ch with the Economist .  Thank you very 
much.  Chair Powell, you stated twice today that all depositors ’ savings in the banking system 
are safe.  Are you saying that de facto deposit insurance covers all savings?  Shouldn’ t Congress 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 23  
 have a say in that ?  and, just by way of example, if a bank with less than $1  billion in assets 
failed , are you promising to bail out all of its depositors?  Thanks . 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I ’m not saying anything more than I ’m saying.  So—but what 
I’m saying is you’ ve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there ’s a threat of 
serious harm to the economy or to —or to the financial system , and we ’re prepared to use those 
tools.  And I think depositors should assume that their —that their deposits are safe.  
MICHELLE SM ITH.  Let ’s go to Greg Robb. 
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from Market Watch.  I was 
wondering if you could give us a little bit more color.  You gave just a little bit of color .  You 
said during the first week of the Silicon Valley weekend—you said the question you guys asked 
was “H ow did this happen?” when you saw Silicon Valley Bank.  So I was wondering if you 
could go to the Credit Suisse merger .  I mean , wasn ’t that the big gorilla in the room?  Aren’t—
didn’ t you breathe a sigh of reli ef when that merger happened?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So, you know , we—that was really the Swiss government that 
we of course were, were  following it over the course of the weekend, and we were engaged with 
their authorities in the way that you would expect, all the ways that you would expect.  It seems to have been a positive outcome in the sense that the transaction was agreed to , and it  has been —
the markets have accepted it , and it seems to have gone well , and I think there was a concern that 
it might not go well.  So coming into the middle of this week, yes, I would say that that is going 
well so far.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nicole.  
NICOLE GOODKIND.  Hi .  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Nicole Goodkind with CNN 
Business.  In the Summary of Economic Projections , the FOMC sees the unemployment rate 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 23  
 increasing to 4.5 percent this year.  I’m wondering how you anticipate preventing this from 
snowballing w hile using the admittedly blunt tools at your disposal .  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that ’s just —that’s an estimate of what will happen as demand 
slows and as conditions soften in the labor market and it ’s just —it’ s a highly uncertain estimate.  
And, I mean, I was r eally —we have to bring inflation down to 2 percent.  The cost s of bringing it 
down—there are real costs to bring ing it down to 2 percent, but the cost s of failing are much 
higher.  And if you read your history,  as I’m sure you have, you can see that if  the c entral bank 
doesn’ t get inflation back in place, get inflation —make sure that inflation expectations remain 
anchored, you can have a long series of years where inflation is high and volatile , and it ’s hard to 
invest capital, it ’s hard for an economy t o perform well.  A nd we ’re looking to avoid that and, 
you know , to get back to where we need to be —back to where we were for a quarter century, and 
get there as quickly as we can.  
NICOLE GOODKIND.  But I guess the question is, historically , it’s hard to —
historically , it’s been hard to contain unemployment and I,  I—the question is, do you worry 
about some sort of snowball effect , and how do you factor that into your projections and your 
thoughts?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, i t depends on whether  you—so recessions tend to be nonlinear, 
and so they’ re very hard to model.  Y ou know , the models all work in a kind of linear way—if 
you have more of this, you get more of tha t.  But when a recession happens, the reactions tend to 
be nonlinear and that ’s what —so we don’ t know whether that ’ll happen this time.  We don’ t 
know —if so, we don’ t know how significant it will be , and so, you know , we’re very focused on 
getting inflation down because we know in the longer run that that is the thing that will most 
benefit the people we serve.  That ’s how we can have a long —you know, we ’ve had very strong 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 23  
 labor markets through these long expansions that w e’ve had.  Four of the five longest, or three of 
the four longest expansions in U.S. history have been really since the high -inflation period.  And 
the reason was inflation wasn ’t forcing the c entral bank to come in and stop an incipient or , or, 
you know , an expansion.   You can  have very, very long expansions without high inflation, and 
we had several of those , and they’ re very good for people.  You see late in an expansion—you 
see low unemployment, you see the benefits of wages going to people at the lower  end of the 
wage spectrum .  It’s just a place that we should try to get back to. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean . 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Jean Young with Market News.  I just wanted to ask, 
with all the events of the past two weeks, do you still see a possibi lity of a soft landing for the 
U.S. economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know it’s , it’s too early to say , really , whether these events have 
had much of an effect.  It’s hard for me to see how they would have helped the possibility—but I 
guess I would just say, it’s too early to say whether there really have been changes in that.  Y ou 
know , the question will be how long this period is sustained.  The longer it ’s sustained, then the 
greater will be the likely declines in —or tightening in credit standards, credit availability, so 
we’ll just have to see.  I do still think , though, that there ’s a— there’s a  pathway to that.  I think 
that pathway still exists and , you know , we’re certainly trying to find it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powe ll.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with 
Marketplace.  Just wondering :  How many financial institutions have been issued matters 
requiring attention or matters requiring immediate attention citations at this point ? 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 23  
 CHAIR POWELL.   How many?  I don’ t know.  But t hose are serious—those are serious 
regulatory, in particular  immediate attention, and that’s—and I guess there were six of them.   So. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And, and getting to the seriousness of it, how are you 
going to ensure that banks comply with these citations, take them seriously —how will you 
enforce them?  
CHAIR POWELL.  That  is a great question and is right in the heart of what the review 
will be doing under Vice Chair Barr ’s leadership.  So that ’s, I think that ’s where —that’s what 
you think ab out.  What can we do to make sure  that—but , again, that ’s not for me to answer 
today.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Do you have specific thoughts on that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well I , I—see, if I did, I wouldn’ t share them because I , I really, you 
know , this review is going on, and, you know , I want nothing other than us to find out what 
happened and why, figure out what we can do to do better, and then implement those changes.  
That’s all I want.  It’s—For me to be giving you my half -formed , or partially informed , thoughts, 
it, you know , just isn ’t appropriate.  There ’s a real serious review going on with, with people 
from all over the Federal Reserve System who are not connected to this , you know, to this work, 
not connected to this bank, and under , again, Vice Chair Barr ’s leadership, and I ’m confident 
that it will produce a satisfactory result.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay, we ’ll go to Jennifer for the last question.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  Curious —how do you view financial conditions right now?  If credit becomes 
expensive enough, choking off growth, as you said you’ re watching for, would that situation 
warrant a rate cut?  What situation would warrant a rate cut?  And have the bank failures 
March 2 2, 20 23   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 23  
 prompted any discussion around changing the implementation of the balance sheet runoff?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we haven’ t really talked about changing the balance sheet 
implementation —that ’s not something we ’ve discussed yet.  As I mentio ned, we ’re always 
willing to change that if we conclude that it’ s appropriate, but we ’re really not seeing any signs 
there.  Sorry, then the question before that was, just give me a — 
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Curious  how you view financial conditions now and, if 
credit were to tighten enough, if that would prompt a rate cut.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So financial conditions seem to have tightened—and probably by 
more than the traditional indexes say , because traditional indexes are focused a lot on  [interest] 
rates and [prices of] equities, and they don’ t necessarily capture lending conditions .  So we think 
that, though.  So there are other measures which, if they ’re focused on , you know —bank lending 
conditions and things like that —they show some more tighteni ng.  The question for us , though, 
is, how significant will that be and how, you know —what will be the extent of it and what will 
be the duration of it?  And then—and then, you know , once you have —once you know that , 
there ’s a fair amount of research about how that , with broad uncertainty bands —how that works 
its way into the economy [and] over what period of time.  And so, you know , we’ll be looking to 
see the first part of that —like how serious is this, and does it look like it ’s going to be sustained, 
and if it is,  you know , it could easily have a significant macroeconomic e ffect, and we would 
factor that into our policy decisions.  I mentioned with rate cuts, rate cuts are not in our base case, and, you know , so that’s all I have to say.  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  
May 3, 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  Before discussing today’ s meeting, let me comment 
briefly on recent developments in the banking sector.  Conditions in that sector have broadly 
improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient.  We will 
continue to monitor conditions in the  sector.  We are committed to learning the  right  lessons 
from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.  As a first step in that process, last week we released Vice Chair for Supervision Barr ’s Review of the 
Federal Reserve’ s Super vision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.  The review ’s findings 
underscore the need to address our rules and supervisory practices to make for a stronger and more resilient banking system, and I am confident that we will do so. 
From the perspective of  monetary policy, our focus remains squarely on our dual 
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  Price stability is the 
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of  strong 
labor market conditions that benefit all.  
Today, the FOMC  raised its policy interest rate by ¼ percentage point.  Since early last 
year, we have raised interest rates by a total of 5 percentage points in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.  We are also continuing to reduce our securities holdings.  Looking ahead, we will take a data -dependent 
approach in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.  I will 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 25 
 have more to say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic 
developments. 
The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP  rising at a below-trend 
pace of 0.9 percent.  The pace of economic growth in the first quarter of this year continued to be modest, at 1.1 percent, despite a pickup in consumer spending.  Activity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting higher mortgage, mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates and 
slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. 
The labor market remains very tight.  Over the first three months of the year, job gains 
averaged 345 ,000 jobs per month.  The unemployment rate remained very low in March, at 
3.5 percent.  Even so, there are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are 
coming back into better balance.  The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.  Nominal wage growth has sown —
shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.  But overall, labor 
demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers. 
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in March, total PCE prices rose 4.2 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent.  Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.  Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  Despite elevated inflation, longer- term 
inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. 
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by, by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 25  
 that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are high ly attentive to the risks that high inflation pose —poses to both sides of our mandate, and 
we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
At today’ s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 to 5¼ percent.  And we ’re continuing to  [carry 
out] the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  
With today’ s action, we have raised interest rates by 5 percentage points in a little more 
than a year.  We are seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest  
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment.  It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be reali zed, especially on inflation. 
In addition, the economy is likely to face further headwinds from tighter credit 
conditions.  Credit conditions had already been tightening over the past year or so in response to our policy actions and a softer economic outlook.  But the strains that emerged in the banking sector in early March appear to be resulting in even tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.  In turn, these tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and i nflation.  The extent of these effects remains uncertain.  
In light of these uncertain headwinds, along with the monetary policy restraint we have 
put in place, our future policy actions will depend on how events unfold.  In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.  We , we will make that determination meeting by meeting, based on the totality of 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 25  
 incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.  And we 
are prepared to do more if greater monetar y policy restraint is warranted.  
We remain committed to bring ing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keep 
longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is likely to require a period 
of below -trend growth and some softe ning of labor market conditions.  Restoring price stability 
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run. 
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Tha nks.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   Thanks for taking our 
questions.  I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June.  And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March 
minutes  and, if so , what a recession like what the y’re envisioning would look and feel like when 
it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , taking your question—of course , today our decision was to raise 
the federal  funds rate by 25 basis points.  A , a decision on a pause was not made today.  You will 
have noticed that in the —in the  statement from March, we had a sentence that said the 
Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.  Tha t sentence is , 
is not in, in the statement anymore.  We took that out , and instead we ’re saying that, in 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 25  
 determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation 
to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into a ccount certain factors.  So we —that ’s a—
that’s a meaningful change that we’ re no longer saying that we anticipat e.  And so we ’ll be 
driven by incoming data meeting by meeting.  And, you know, we ’ll approach that question at 
the June meeting.  So the —the staff ’s forecast is —so let me say —start by saying that that ’s not 
my own most likely case, which is really that , that the economy will continue to grow at , at a 
modest rate this year.  And I think that ’s—so different people on the Committee have different 
forecasts.  That ’s, that ’s my own assessment of the most likely path.  [The] s taff produces its 
own forecast, and it ’s independent of the forecasts of , of the participants, which include the 
Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course.  And we think this is a healthy thing—
that the , the staff is writing down what they really think.  They ’re not especially influenced by 
what the G overnors think, and vice versa.  The Governors are not taking what the staff says and 
just writing that down.  So it ’s actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can 
have different perspectives.  So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, a nd by that I 
would charact erize as one in which the ris e in unemployment is smaller than is —has been typical 
in modern- era recessions.  I  wouldn’ t want to characterize the  staff ’s forecast for this meeting.  
We’ll, we ’ll leave that to the minutes —but broadly, broadly similar to tha t. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from  the Washington Post. 
Thanks for taking our questions.  I ’m wondering if you can talk about the account of possible 
effects of a debt -limit standoff.  You ’ve said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised , but do 
you see any economic s effects of even getting close to a default?  And what type of situation 
would that look like?  
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 25  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I wouldn’ t want to speculate specifically, but I will say this:  
These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they ’re, they ’re for Congress and the 
Administration —for the elected parts of the government to deal with.  And they’ re really 
consigned to them.  From our standpoint, I  would just say this:   It’s essential that  the debt ceiling 
be raised in a timely way , so that the U .S. government can pay all of its bills when they’ re due.  
A failure to do that would be unprecedented.  We’d be in uncharted territory, and the —and the  
consequences to the U .S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite 
a[d]verse.  So  I’ll just leave it there.  We , we don’t give advice to either side.  We just would 
point out that it—that it ’s very important that this be done.  And the , the other point I’ll make 
about that, though, is that no one should assume that the F ed can protect the economy from the 
potential, you know, short - and long- term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time.  We, we —
it’s, it would be so uncertain that it ’s just as important  that, that  this—we never get to a place 
where we’ re actually talking about or even having a situation where the U .S. government ’s not 
paying its bills.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And just a follow -up. Was discussion around the uncertainty of a 
possible standoff —did that affect today ’s monetary policy decision at all?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t say that it did.  It was —of course, it ’s something that 
came up.  We talk a lot about risks to the —to the  outlook, and that will —that c ome up.  A 
number of people did raise tha t as a risk to the outlook.  I wouldn’ t say that it was important in 
today’ s monetary policy decision. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, can you—oh, thank you.  Steve Liesman, CNBC. 
Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 25  
 where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest 
rate risks?  And can you tell me what supervisory actions you’ ve done in the wake of the recent 
bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk ?  
And kind of part 3 , but it ’s all the same question here—do, do you still think this separation 
principle that mone tary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So the February 14 presentation—I didn’ t remember it very 
well.  But now, of course, I ’ve gone back and looked at it very carefully.  I did remember it.  And  
what it was was a general presentation.  It was an informational briefing of the whole B oard—
the entire B oard.  I think all members were there.  And it was about interest rate risk in the banks 
and, and lots of data.  And there was one page on Silicon Val ley Bank, which talked about, you 
know, the amount of losses they—or mark -to-market losses they had in their portfolio.  There 
was nothing in it about —that I recall, anyway, about , about  the risk of a bank run.  So it was —I 
think the takeaway was , they were going away to do a —an assessment, a vertical —sorry, 
horizontal assessment of , of banks.  It wasn ’t—it, it  wasn ’t presented as an urgent or alarming 
situation.  It was presented as a —as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing.  And I 
thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it.  
In terms of what we ’re doing—of course, I think banks themselves are , are—many, many 
banks are now , are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since , since  the 
events of , of early March, to build liquidity.  And you asked about the separation principle.  I—
you know, like so many things, it, it’ s very useful.  But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits.  I 
mean, I , I think in this particular case , we have found that the monetary policy tools and the 
financial stability tools are not in conflict.  They ’re both—they ’re working well together.  We ’ve 
used our , our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities.  And, at the 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 25  
 same time, we ’ve been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment 
and price stability.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, I ’m sorry.  I don’ t mean to  be argumentative, but 
the, the staff report said , “SVB  . . . has significant interest rate risk. ”  It said, “I nterest rate risk 
measurement [s] . . . failed ” at SVB.  And it said, “ Banks with large unrealized losses face 
significant safety and soundness ri sks.”  Why was that not alarming?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I mean, I didn’ t say it wasn ’t alarming.  It was —they ’re 
pointing out something that they’ re working on and that they’ re on the case—that , that, you 
know, that —I’m not sure whether they mentioned —I thi nk they did, actually.  They mentioned 
that they had taken regulatory action matter —or supervisory action in the form of matters 
requiring attention.  So I think that was also in the presentation.  I think it was to say : Yes, this is 
a bank , and there are many other banks that are experiencing this —these things, and we ’re on the 
case.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  I wanted to ask —obviously, with the recent 
bank turmoil, we ’ve seen multiple banks buy other banks.  And I was just curious whether you 
think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial 
stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U .S. getting even 
larger.  
CHAIR POWELL .  So I, you know, we certainly don’ t—and I don’ t have an agenda to 
further consolidate banks.  There’ s been —consolidation has been a factor in the U .S. banking 
industry really since interstate banking and before that even—i t goes back more than 30 years.  
You—when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks.  Now there 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 25  
 are 4,000 and change.  So that ’s, that ’s going on.  I personally have long felt that having small -, 
medium -, and large -size banks is a, a great part of our banking system.  You know, the 
community banks serve particular customers very wel l; regional banks serve very important 
purposes , and the various kinds of G -SIBs do as well.  So I think it ’s healthy to have a, you 
know, an arrange— a range of different kinds of banks doing different things.  I think that ’s a 
positive thing.  Is it a financial —so I would just say, in terms of J .P. Morgan buying First 
Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely.  
That, that  is their ro le, so I really don’ t have a comment on , on that process.  As you know, 
there’ s an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank.  So it was legitimate.  And I think the 
FDIC , I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least -cost bi d.  So I w ould assume 
that’s what they did.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  S o do you have any concerns about the fact that they’ re, they’ re 
getting larger in general ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I think it ’s probably good policy that we , we don’ t want the 
largest banks doing big acquisi tions.  That is the policy.  And —but this is —this is an exception 
for a failing bank.  And I , I think it ’s actually a good outcome for the banking system.  It also 
would have —would have been a good—a good outcome for the banking system had one of the 
regional banks bought , bought  this company.  And that could have been the outcome.  But , 
ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is , it goes to the , the least -cost 
bid. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Now to Colby. COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Col by Smith with the Financial Times. At the March 
meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 25  
 equal to one or more rate increases.  So, given developments since then, how has your estimate 
changed?  
CHAIR P OWELL.  Yeah.  I think— I think I follow that up by saying, it’ s, it’s quite 
impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect.  But, in principle, that ’s the 
idea.  You know, when we—we ’ve been raising interest rates, and that raises the pr ice of credit , 
and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism.  And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tight er in a kind of 
broadly similar way.  It isn ’t—it isn ’t possible to make a kind of clean translation between one 
and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we ’re trying it.  But , ultimately, we 
have to be —we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment.  
So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance.  But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates —in principle, we won ’t have 
to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happene d.  The extent of that is so 
hard to predict because we don ’t know how persistent these , these  effects will be.  We don ’t 
know how large they’ ll be and how long they’ ll take to be transmitted.  But that ’s, that ’s what 
we’ll be watching carefully to find out.  
COLBY SMITH.  Just to quickly follow up—what does it suggest about the scope for the 
Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains strong then, if , if it’s having some kind of substitute effect?  
CHAIR POWELL .  It’s that —this is just something that we have to factor in as we —as 
we want to find ourselves.  So I guess I would say it this way:  The assessment of , of the extent 
to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one , meeting by 
meeting, and we ’re going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that —they ’re listed in , in 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 25  
 the statement, the obvious factors.  That ’s, that ’s the way we’ re going to be thinking about it.  
And that ’s really all we can do.  As I say, it does complicate —we, we have, you know, a broad 
understanding of monetary policy.  Credit tightening is a different thing.  There’ s a lot of 
literature on that.  But translating it into , into  rate hikes is uncertain , let’s say —it adds even 
further uncertainty.  Nonetheless, we’ ll be able to see what ’s happening with credit conditions —
what ’s happening with lending. We get —there’ s a lot of data on that.  And, you know, we ’ll, 
we’ll factor that into our decisionmaking. 
MICH ELLE SMITH.  Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thank you.  So, noting that 
the statement dropped the reference to “ sufficiently ” restricted —“restrictive, ” I was wondering, 
given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5¼ percent is, in fact, 
sufficiently restrictive.  
CHAIR POWELL. That ’s going to be an ongoing assessment.  We ’re going to need data 
to accumulate on that —not an assessment that we’ ve made, as —that , that  would mean we think 
we’ve reached that point.  And I just think it ’s, it’s not possible to say that with confidence now.  
But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the S ummary of E conomic P rojections from the March 
meeting showed that in—at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was —
this was the appropriate level of the —of the  ultimate high  level of rates.  We don ’t know that. 
We’ll revisit that at the June meeting.  And that ’s—you know, we ’re just going to have to—
before we real ly declare that, I think we ’re going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you 
know, make that —as I mentioned, it ’s an ongoing assessment. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  I have a follow -up on credit.  Could you give us a sense of 
what the SLOOS survey indicated?  It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 25  
 tightening credit as of the, the last survey.  What did this one show, and how did that weigh into 
your deliberations?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  we’re going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in li ne 
with our usual time  frame.  And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent , when you 
see it , with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we ’re seeing 
from other sources.  You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have —some of them had been tightening their lending standards.  
Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Nick. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, the argument 
around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was 
to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves.  After the bank failures in March, as you’ve discussed, the Fed staff p rojected a recession starting later this year.  So my question is 
why it was necessary to raise interest rates today .  Or, put , put differently :  If the whole point of 
slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you’ ve, for the last  two 
meetings , been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to 
keep moving?  
CHAIR POWELL. Well, we—the reason is that we —again, with our monetary policy 
we’re try —trying to reach and then—and then stay at a , for an extended period, a level of 
policy—a policy stance that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over 
time.  And, you know, that ’s what we ’re trying to do with our —with our tool.  I think slowing 
down was the right move.  I , I think it ’s enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 25  
 so.  So I , I—you know, we really—you know, we have to balance.  We always have to balance 
the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of 
maybe slowing down economic activity too much.  And we thought that this rate hike, along 
with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that. 
NICK TIMIRAOS.  And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to 
Howard ’s question—you’ ll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently 
restrictive stance.  Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six -week intermeeting cycle?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  I mean, as  I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment 
will be an ongoing one.  You—you know, you can’ t—with , with  economic data, you, you 
can’t—you’ ve, you’ ve seen —take inflation for a minute.   Look, look back.  We’ ve seen inflation 
come down—move back up two or three times since March of 2021.  We’ve seen inflation have 
a few months of coming down and then come right back up.  So I think you’ re going to want to 
see that —you know, that a few months of data will , will persuade you that you’ ve—that you’ ve 
got this right , kind of thing.  And, you know, we , we have the luxury:  W e’ve raised 500 basis 
points.  I think that policy is tight.  I think real rates are probably —that you can calculate them  
many different ways.  But one way is to look at the  nominal rate and then subtract a , a reasonable 
estimate of , of, let’s say , one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent.  So you’ ve got 2 percent 
real rates.  That ’s meaningfully above what most people would—many people, anyway, would, 
would assess as, yo u know, the neutral rate.  So  policy is tight.  And you see that in interest —
interest -sensitive activities.  And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities.  
And if you—if you put the —you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that ’s, that ’s 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 25  
 ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we ’re, we may not be far off —we’re possibly 
even at —that level.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you very much, Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence with 
Fox Business.  So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections 
show , at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 
3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent  target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Look —I think we ’re always going to have 2 percent as our , our 
target .  We’re always going to be focusing on getting there.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, it ’s—let me just say , that ’s not what we ’re looking for.  
We’re looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time.  I mean, we —that ’s, that ’s not a 
question that ’s in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things.  But , ultimately, 
we’re not looking to get  to 3 percent and then drop our tools.  We have a, a  goal of getting to 
2 percent.  We think it ’s going to take some time.  We don ’t think it’ ll be a smooth process.  
And, you know, I think we ’re going to—we ’re going to need to stay at this for a while.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  How does the other side of the mandate —the jobs side —once 
you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think they, they—you know, they, they will both matter equally at 
that point .  Right now , you have a labor market that ’s still extraordinarily tight.   You still got 
1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number , for every unemployed person.  We 
do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions.  But, overall, you’ re near a 
50-year low in unemployment.  Wages —you all will have seen that the wage number from late 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 25  
 last week, and it ’s—whenever it was.  And, you know, it ’s, it’s a couple  of percentage points 
above what would be —what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.  So  we do 
see some softening ; we see new labor supply coming in.  These are very positive developments.  
But the labor market  is very, very strong, where as inflation is, you know, running high—well 
above our —well above our goal.  And right now , we need to be focusing on bringing inflation 
down.  Fortunately, we ’ve been able to do that so far without unemployment going up. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Matt.  
MATTHEW BO ESLER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News.  
So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed 
officials ’ projections did imply or seem ed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast 
as well, given the strong first -quarter GDP tracking estimates.  And so I ’m just wondering if you 
could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you’ re optimistic that a recession can be avoided, 
given that that ’s the F ed staff ’s forecast —possibly also the broader Committee ’s forecast as 
well—and , and also, of course, most private -sector forecasters ’. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  I don ’t think —you know, I know what ’s printed in the 
Summary of E conomic P rojections and all that.  I don’ t think you can deduce exactly what you 
said about what participants think, because you don’ t know what they were thinking for first -
quarter GDP at that point.  They could have been thinking about a fairly low number.  Anyway, in any case, I ’ll just say , I, I continue to think that it ’s possible that this time is really different.  
And the reason is , there ’s just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market.  It’s, it’s 
interesting , as, you know, we ’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the 
unemployment rate is 3½ percent,  pretty much where it was —even lower than where it was 
when we started.  So job openings are still very, very high.  We see—by surveys and much, 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 25  
 much [other] evidence —that, that  conditions are cooling gradually.  But it’ s—it really is 
different.  You know, it wasn’ t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of 
the—as they ’ve declined without unemployment going up.  Well, that ’s what we ’ve seen.  So 
we—there are no promises in this.  But it just seems that, to me , that it’ s possible that we can 
continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment 
that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes.  Now, that would be a gainst history.  I , I 
fully appreciate that.  That would be against the , the pattern.  But I do think that it —that this, that 
the situation in the labor market , with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are 
actually —wages have been moving down.  Wag e increases have been moving down, and that ’s a 
good sign—down to a more sustainable level.  So I think that —I think it ’s still possible.  I —you 
know, I think, you know, the , the case of , of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely 
than that of having, having a recession.  But it’ s not —it’ s not that the case of having a recession 
is—I don’ t rule that out, either.  It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild 
recession.  
MATTHEW BOESLER.   The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still 
well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.  Do you see that as well?  And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment?  
CHAIR POWELL. Sure.  So we look at a range of wage , wage  measures.  And then 
that’s in nominal.  And then—so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases 
plus inflation.  And so you ca n—you can look at, you know, the employment compensation 
index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta w age t racker, compensation per hour —basically , 
those four and many others.  And you can—you can look at , at what the —what they would have 
to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.  They can 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 25  
 deviate.  You know, corporate margins can go up and down.  And there is a feature of long 
expansions where they do go down—where labor gets a bigger share toward later , later in a 
recession —sorry, later in an expansion.  So, yeah.  The, the—you know, and we calculate those, 
and you have to take the precision with a degree of —a degree of salt.  But I would say that what 
they will show is that, you know, if , if the—if wages  are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer 
to where they need to be.  Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get —to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time.  I—by the way, I don’ t want 
to—I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation.  You ’re asking me a very 
specific question.  I think there are many things.  I think wages and prices tend to move together.  
And it ’s very hard to say what ’s causing what.  But, you know, I ’ve never said that, you know, 
that—that wages are really the principal driver , because I don ’t think that ’s really right.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Great.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Well, you mentioned 
profit margins.  Those have expanded—did expand sharply during this inflationary period.  And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven’ t 
fallen as much as might be expected, given that we ’re seeing at least some pullback among 
consumer spending.  So , speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a 
driver of higher prices?  And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to 
reduced inflation in the coming months?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So higher profits and higher m argins are what happens when you 
have an imbalance between supply and demand:  too much demand, not enough supply.  And we’ve been in a situation in many parts of the economy where , where supply has been fixed or , 
or not flexible enough.  And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices.  
So to get, I , I think—as goods pipelines have , have  gotten, you know, back to normal so that we 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 25  
 don’t have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing—I think you will see inflation 
come dow n.  And you’ ll see —you’ ll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of 
full competition , where there’ s enough supply to meet demand.  And then it ’s—then it ’s, then 
you’re really back to full competition.  That ’s—that would be the dynamic I would expect.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Can you 
tell us something about what your policy reaction function is —your policy framework is going 
forward?  When you look at the economy at the next  meeting, are you looking at incoming data, 
which is, by definition, backward looking?  Are you going to be forecasting what you think is 
going to happen?  Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I didn ’t catch the last part.  Rolling ? 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year.  Do you 
rule that out?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Oh, yes.   Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Okay , I got it.   So, what are we looking 
at?  I mean, we look at a combination of data and , and forecasts.  Of course, the whole idea is 
to—is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data.  So we ’re always, always 
looking at both.  You know, and it will —of course , it’ll be the obvious things.  It ’ll be readings 
on infla tion.  It ’ll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of 
those many things.  I think a particular focus for us going—now , over the past six, seven weeks 
now and going forward is going to be , what ’s happening with credit tighte ning?  A re small and 
medium -sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on 
lending?   And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy.  
That’ll, that ’ll be an important thing.  I just —you know, we ’ll be looking at everything.  It’s—
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 25  
 again, I would just point out , we’ve raised rates by 5 percentage points.  We are shrinking the 
balance sheet.   And now we have credit conditions tightening—not just in the normal way, but 
perhaps a little bit more , due to what ’s happened.  And we have to factor all of that in and, and 
make our assessment of —you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive.   And 
we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable l ags.  So this is 
challenging.  But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that ’s what we think.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   What about the idea of rate cuts? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So we  on the Committee have a —have a view that inflation is 
going to come down—not so quickly, but it ’ll take some time.   And in that world, if that forecast 
is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and —to cut rates, and we won’ t cut rates.  If you 
have a different forecast and, you know, markets —or have been, from time to time , pricing in, 
you know, quite rapid reducti ons in inflation, you know, we ’d, we ’d factor that in.  But that ’s not 
our forecast.  And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation 
moves down.  Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn ’t moved 
much.  And it ’s quite stable.  And, you know, so we think we ’ll have to —demand will have to 
weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions , conditions may have to soften a bit more to 
begin to see progress there.  And, again, in that world, i t wouldn’ t be—it wouldn’ t be appropriate 
for us to cut rates.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Courtenay.  
COURTENAY BROWN.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  I ’m curious how you view the 
role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress .  Do you 
think it ’s contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 25  
 compete with banks for deposits?  And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of 
the facility?   Or do you see that being put on the table in the future?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.   Sure.  So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. 
And, you know, the —it’ s, it’s really not contributing, we don’ t think, now.  It hasn ’t actually 
been growing.  You know, it moved up—moved down and then moved back up to where it was.  What happened in the —when , when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have 
really stabilized now —what happened was , institutional investors took their uninsured deposits 
and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that.  Over the course of , of maybe the last year, retail investors had 
been gradual —as they do in every tightening cycle, they’ ve been gradually moving their deposits 
into higher -yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds.  
So that ’s a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a , a tightening cycle.  What 
was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that.  But it doesn’ t seem to have had any —any effect 
overall on the  over night repo facility.  That is really there to , to help us keep rates where they ’re 
supposed to be, and it ’s, it’s serving that purpose very well.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Sarah.  
SARAH EWALL -WICE.  Sarah Ewall -Wice, CBS News.   I want to go back to the debt 
ceiling for a moment.  I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy , but can you just 
speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets , and borrowing?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  I would just say, it’ s —I , I don’ t really think we should be —
we shouldn’ t even be talking about a world in which the U .S. doesn’ t pay its  bills.  It just—it just 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 25  
 shouldn’ t be a thing.  And, and again, I would just say, we don’ t—no one should assume that the 
Fed can do—can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally 
from , from  the damage that such , such an  event might inflict.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Scott.  
SCOTT HORSLEY.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  Scott Horsley for NPR.  In his report last 
week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the 
regulatory—or  the supervisory lapse s at Silicon Valley Bank :  a policy change in 2019 to exempt 
all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight.  You were here in 2019.  Do you share that view, and what would it take to get the , the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be 
necessary?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I didn’ t—I didn’ t take part in creating the report or doing the 
work, but I do— I have read it, of course.  And I find it persuasive.  I mean, I would say it this 
way:  A, a very large —a large bank, not a very large bank—a large bank failed quite suddenly 
and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system.  I thin k 
the only thing that , that  I’m really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, 
and, and identify what we need to do to address that.  Some of that is —may,  it may just have 
been technology evolving.  You know, we have to keep up with all  that.  But some of it may be 
our policies, and—supervisory and regulatory, whatever.  What our job is now is , identify those 
things and implement them.  And that ’s kind of the only thing I care about is —and I think— I 
feel like I am accountable for doing e verything I can to make sure that that happens.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Let’s go to Evan. 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 25  
 EVAN RYSER.  Thank you.  Evan R yser with M NI Market News.  Chair Powell, are we 
in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks?  And, 
secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates?  Is that what the statement is saying?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I guess I would— I guess I would say it this way.  There were 
three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the  stress that we —
that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress.  Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected.  I think that the resolution and sale of , of First Republic 
kind of draws a line under that period of —is an important step toward drawing a line under that 
period of , of severe stress.  Okay.  I also think we are very focused on what ’s happening with 
credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the —in the  Beige Book, and 
you will see in the SLOOS , is, is small and medium—medium -sized, small and medium -sized 
banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards —build liquidity.  What ’s going 
to be the macroeconomic effect of that?  More broadly, we , we will continue to very care fully 
monitor what ’s going on in the banking system, and we ’ll factor that assessment into our 
decisions in an important way, going forward.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Greg.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Fed Chairman.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I just 
wondered i f you ’ve done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up 
to it over the last—since you’ ve been Fed Chairman, I think I ’ve heard you say a couple of times 
that you defer red to the Vice C hair for S upervision.  Do you think that was the right way to go 
about this?  And , yeah, comments on that.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So let me say, first of all, I ’ve been Chair of the Board for 
five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes.  I think w e’ve learned some 
May 3, 2023   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 25  
 new things as well, and we need to do better.  And , as I mentioned, I thought the report was 
unflinching and appropriately so.  I welcome it.   And I agree with and will support those 
recommendations.  And I do feel that I ’m personally accountable to do what I can to foster 
measures that will address the problems.  So, on, on the V ice C hair for S upervision, you know, 
the place to start is , is the statutory role, which is quite unusual.  The Vice Chair, it says, shall 
deploy policy recommendations —“develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding 
supervision and regulation of depository institution . . . companies  . . . , and shall oversee the 
supervision and regulation of such firms.”   So this is Congress establishing a four -year term for 
someone else on the Board—not , not the C hair—as V ice C hair for Supervision who really gets 
to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors.  Congress wanted 
that person to be —to have political accountability for developing that agenda.  So the way it 
works —the way it has worked in practice f or me is , I’ve had a good working relationship.  I give 
my, my counsel, my input privately, and that ’s—I offer that.  And I have good conversations, 
and I try to contribute constructively.  I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that 
person, including working with, with  Vice Chair Barr and , and his predecessor.  And I think 
that’s the way it ’s supposed to work, and that ’s appropriate.  I, I believe that ’s what the law 
requires.  And, you know —but , but it isn ’t—I wouldn’ t say it’ s a matter of complete deference.  
It’s more , I have a —I have a role in , in presenting my views and discussing—having an 
intelligent discussion about what ’s going on and why.  And, you know, that ’s, that ’s my input.  
But, ultimately , that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of 
Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision.  
GREG ROBB.  Just wondered if you have any regrets?  Or was there anything that, you 
know —decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what ’s happened?

 CHAIR POWELL.   I’ve had a few , sure.  I mean, you know, who doesn’ t look back and 
think that you could have done things differently?   But, honestly, you don’ t—you don’ t get to do 
that.  Again, my focus is on what —control the controllable.  As one of my great mentors used to 
always say, “C ontrol the controllable.”   What we control now is , make a fair assessment, learn 
the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them.  And , and I think that , that  
Vice Chair Barr ’s report is an excellent first step in that, but we ’ve got to follow through. 
MEGAN CAS SELLA.  Hi, there.  Megan Cas sella with Barron ’s.  Did the possibility of 
pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered?   I’m curious if 
you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again 
or what those discussions entailed.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So support for the 25 basis  point rate increase was very strong across 
the board.  I would say there are a number of people —and, you know, you’ ll see this in the 
minutes.  I don’ t want to try to do the head count in real time.  But people did talk about pausing, 
but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we ’re—I mean, there ’s a sense that we ’re, 
we’re—that, you know, we ’re much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that —you 
know, as I mentioned, if you—if you add up all the tightening that ’s going on through various 
channels, it ’s—we , we feel like we —you know, we ’re getting close or , or maybe even there.  
But that, again, that ’s going to be an ongoing assessment.  And , and we ’re going to be looking at 
those factors that we listed and —to determine whether there ’s, there ’s more to do. 
MEGAN CAS SELLA.   I’m curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the 
statement.  Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report 
or inflation print be enough to push the F ed to tighten again?

 CHAIR POWELL.   I don ’t want to— I couldn’ t—I couldn’ t really say.  I just think 
we’re—I think we —look , I think we ’ve moved a long way fairly quickly.  And I think we can 
afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  And we ’ll go to Nancy for the last question.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with 
Marketplace.  You mentioned a few times about the lessons you’ ve learned from the banking 
crisis —that you would learn the right lessons.  What are those lessons?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I just would start with something that’ s changed, really, which 
is this —the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through 
history.  And that now needs to be reflected in some —in some way in regulation and in 
supervision.  It —we know —now that we know it ’s possible, I think we didn’ t—no one thought 
that was possible.  No one —I’m not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so—quite 
so quickly.  So I think that, you know, that will play through.  I, I, you know —it will be up to 
Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that.  But I think— I think 
that’s one thing.  I, I guess I would just say that .  Then, you know —tha t we’re going to—
obviously, we ’re going to revisit  [this] .  It’s pretty clear we need —to me , anyways —clear that 
we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size.  And I ’m, I’m 
thinking that we ’re on the —on track to do that as w ell. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Can you be any more specific on stress testing or 
looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  That ’s—see, that ’s, that ’s what Vice Chair Barr ’s role really 
is, and he ’ll take the lead on that.  
Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
June 14, 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  
We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  Price stabilit y is the responsibility of the 
Federal Reserve.  Without price stability, the economy doesn ’t work for anyone.  In particular, 
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
Since early l ast year, the FOMC has  significantly tightened  the stance of monetary 
policy.  We have raised our policy interest rate by 5 percentage points , and we ’ve continued to 
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.  We’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects 
of our tightening have yet to be felt .  In light of how far we ’ve come in tightening policy, the 
uncertain lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from 
credit tightening, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to 
reduce our securities holdings.  Looking ahead, nearly all Committee participants view it as 
likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time.  A nd I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing 
economic developments.  
The U.S. economy slowed significantly last yea r, and r ecent indicators suggest that 
economic activity has continued to expand at a modest pace .  Although growth in consumer 
spending has picked up this year, a ctivity in the housing sector remains weak, largely reflecting 
higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.  Committee partic ipants generally expect subdued

Page 2 of 26 
 growth to continue.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection has real 
GDP growth at 1.0 percent this year and 1.1 percent next year, well below the median estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.  
The labor market remains very tight.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains 
averaged  a robust 283,000 jobs per month.  The unemployment rate moved up but rema ined low 
in May at 3. 7 percent.  T here are some signs that supply and demand in the labor market are 
coming into better balance.  The labor force participation rate has moved up in recent months, 
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.  Nominal wage growth has shown signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.  While the jobs -to-workers gap has 
declined , labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of available workers.  FOMC 
participants expect supply and demand condi tions in the labor market to come into better balance 
over time, easing upward pressures on inflation .  The median unemployment rate projection in 
the SEP rises to 4.1 percent at the end of this year and 4.5 percent at the end of next yea r. 
Inflation remains well above our longer-run 2 percent goal.  Over the 12 months ending 
in April, total PCE proces—prices rose 4. 4 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 4. 7 percent.  In May, the 12-month change in the consumer 
price index came in at 4 percent, and the change in the core, core  CPI was 5.3 percent.   Inflation 
has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.  Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.2 percent this year, 2.5 percent next year, and 2.1 percent in 2025.  Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to run higher than total inflation, and the median projection has been revised in the SEP up to 3.9 percent this year.  Despite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation

 expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of 
households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and price —and stable prices for the A merican people.  My colleagues and I are 
acutely aware that high inflation imposes hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are highly attent ive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
As I noted earlier, since early last year , we’ve raised our policy rate by 5 percentage 
points.  We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest  
rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, especially  housing and investment.  It will take time, 
however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially o n inflation.  
The economy is fac ing headwinds from tighter credit conditions  for households and 
businesses, which are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  The extent of 
these effects remains uncertain.  
In light of how far we ’ve come  in tightening policy, the uncertain lags with which 
monetary policy affects the economy, and potential headwinds from credit tightening, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 
5 to 5¼ percent  and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings . 
As I noted earlier, nearly , nearly all Committee participants expect that it will be 
appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.  But a t this meeting, 
considering how far and how fast we ’ve moved, we judged it prudent to hold the target range 
steady to allow the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 26  
 policy.  I n determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return 
inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening 
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.   
In our SEP, participant s wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path 
for the federal funds rate based on what each  participant judges to be the most likely scenario 
going forward.  If the economy evolves as pr ojected, the median participant projects that the 
appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this year, 4.6  percent 
at the end of 2024, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.  For the end of this year, the  median 
projection is ½ percentage point higher than in our March projections.  I hasten to add, as 
always, that t hese projections are not a Committee decision or plan .  If the economy does not 
evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our  maximum-
employment and price -stability goals.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by 
meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks . 
We remain committed to bring ing inflation —bringing inflation back down to our 
2 percent goal and to keep ing longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing 
inflation is likely to require a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor  market 
conditions.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the countr y.  Everything we do at the Fed  is in service to our public mission.  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 26  
 We will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  And I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby.  
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times .  I’m curious what 
gives you and the Committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time 
when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated.  Interest rate –sensitive sectors like 
housing, w hile they ’ve felt the drag of the past Fed actions, have started to recover in some 
regions , and financial conditions, you know, most recently were easing.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, I guess I would—I guess I would go back to the be ginning of this 
tightening cycle to address that.  So as we started our rate hikes earl y last year, we said there 
were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence —that of the speed of 
tightening, the level to which rates would need to go, and then a period of time over which we ’d 
need to keep policy restrictive.  So at the outset, going back 15 months, the key issue was how 
fast to move rates up , and we moved very quickly by historical standards.  Then last December, 
after four consecut ive 75 basis point hikes, we moderated to a pace of 50 —of a 50 basis point 
hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings.  
So it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to 
our destination.  So the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold 
rates steady at this meeting, I would just say it ’s a continuation of , of that process.  The main 
issue that we’ re focused on now is determining the extent of additional poli cy firming that may 
be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time —so that the pace of the increases and the 
ultimate level of increases are separate variables, given how far it —we have come.   It may make 
sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace.  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 26  
 I want to stress one more thing —and that is that the Committee decision made today was 
only about this meeting.  We didn’ t make any decision about going forward, including what 
would happen at the next meeting, including—we did not dec ide or really discuss anything about 
going to an every- other -meeting kind of an approach or, or really any other approach.  We really 
were focused on what to do at this meeting.  
COLBY SMITH .  So there was no kind of initial debate about the possibility of July—
any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So again, we didn’ t—we didn’ t make a decision about July.  I mean, 
of course, it, it came up in the —in the meeting from time to time.  But really, the focus was, was 
on what to do today.  I would say about, about July two things :  (1) [the] decision hasn ’t been 
made , (2) I do expect that it will be a “ live” meeting.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  I was just 
wondering if you could help us understand the, the narrative here because it feels like there’ s 
been a level shift in the —in the dots, stronger GDP, less of a hit to unemployment, slower 
progress on inflation.  And I ’m wondering in, in this sort of —where ’s the disinflation coming 
from?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  The labor market ’s going to be stronger  it looks like —it’s not 
coming from the re.  Demand ’s not coming down all that fast.  According to GDP —you’ve 
doubled your , your estimate of GDP.  So what ’s the—what ’s the narrative here?  It seems like 
it’s getting more “immaculate ,” rather than more  messy.  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So you ’re, you’ re right that the data came in, I would say, consistent 
with, but on the high side of , expectations.  A nd if you go back to the old —the former SEP—the 
last SEP in March, you will see that  [compared with March, projected real GDP] growth moved 
up.  These are not huge moves, but growth estimates moved up a bit.  Unemployment estimates 
move d down a bit .  Inflation estimates moved up a bit.   And, you know, all three of those kind of 
point in the same direction —which is, you know, that perhaps more [mone tary policy] restraint 
will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting.  So although the level, frankly, is , is 
pretty —the level of 5.6 [percent] is pretty consistent, if you think about it, where the [expected] 
federal funds rate was trading bef ore the bank incidents of early March.  So—but so we ’ve kind 
of gone back to that.  So your question is , where ’s the—where’s the disinflation going to come 
from?  And  I, you know, I don’ t think the story has really changed.  
We—the C ommittee has consistentl y said and believed that the process of getting 
inflation down is going to be a gradual one.  It ’s going to take some time.  And I think you go 
back to the —to the three -part framework for [analyzing] core PCE inflation —which is, we think, 
as good an indicator as you can have for where inflation is going forward.  You start with goods.  
With goods, we need to see continued healing in supply conditions —supply- side conditions.  
They ’ve definitely improved a substantial amou nt, but if you talk to people in business, they will 
say it ’s not back to where it was.  So that ’s, that ’s one thing.  And that should enable goods 
prices to continue —goods, goods  inflation to continue to come down over time.  
In terms of housing services inflation —that ’s another big piece.  And , and you are seeing 
there that new rents  in new , new  leases are, are  coming in at low levels.  And it ’s really a matter 
of time as that goes through the pipeline.  In fact, I think any forecast that people are makin g 
right now about inflation coming down this year will , will  contain a big dose of —this year and 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 26  
 next year —will contain a , a good amount of , of disinflation [com ing] from that source.  And , and 
that’s, again, probably going to come slower than we would [ previously have expected it to come 
into] effect.  
That leaves, you know, the big sector, which is a little more than half , pardon me, of 
the—of core PCE inflation that ’s not housing services.  And, you know, we see only the earliest 
signs of disinfl ation there.  It’ s a sector —it’s a very broad and diverse sector.  I would say [that,] 
in a number of the parts of that sector, the largest cost would be wage cost.  I t’s the service 
sector , so it’s, it’s heavily labor intensive.  And I think many analysts  would say that the key to 
getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions —which 
we have seen.  We have actually seen , you know —I go through a number of indicators 
suggesting there has been some loos ening in labor market conditions.  We need to see that 
continue.  
I would almost say that the, the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation 
down are, are coming into place .  And that would be [real GDP] growth meaningfully below 
trend.  It would be a labor market that’ s loosening.  It would be goods pipelines getting healthier 
and healthier and that kind of thing.  There, there —the things are in place that we need to see, 
but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of  the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, what ’s the 
value in, in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now ?  I mean, not to be 
flippant, but I don’ t lose weight just by buying a gym m embership —I have to actually go to the 
gym.  Sixteen of your colleagues put down a higher year -end ’23 rate today.  A majority of you 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 26  
 think you’ re going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year.  So why not just rip off the 
Band -Aid and raise rates to day?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the —first, I would say that the, the question of speed is a separate 
question from the question—from the —from, from that of level.  Okay.  So —and I think if you 
look at the SEP, that is our estimate —our individual —it’s, it’s really a  cumulation of our 
individual estimates of how far to go.  I , I mentioned how , how we got to those numbers .  In 
terms of speed, it ’s, it’s what I said at the beginning, which is , speed was very important last 
year.  As we get closer and closer to t he destination—and, according to the SEP, we ’re not so far 
away from the destination , in most people ’s accounting —it’s, it’s reasonable—it ’s common 
sense to go a little slower, just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every 
meeti ng.  And so the C ommittee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace, if 
only slightly . 
Then there are benefits to that.  So that gives us more information to make decisions.  We 
may try to make better decisions.  I think it allows the ec onomy a little more time to adapt as 
we—as we make our decisions going forward , and we ’ll get to see, you know —we haven ’t 
really —we don’ t know the full extent of , of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we ’ve 
seen.  We, we—i t would be early to see those, but we don’ t know what the extent is.  We’ ll have 
some more time to see that unfold.  I mean, it ’s, it’s just the idea that we ’re trying to get this 
right.  And this is —if you think of the two things as separate variables , then I think —I think that 
the skip— I shouldn’ t call it a skip —the , the decision makes sense.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  I know you said July is live .  With only one June employment —with 
only the June e mployment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July 
meeting —you ge t the ECI after, you get the S enior L oan O fficer S urvey after , you get some 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 26  
 bank earnings at the end of next month—w hat incremental information will the C ommittee be 
using to inform their judgment on whether this is , in fact, a skip or a , a longer pause?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think you’ re adding that to the , the data that we’ ve seen since 
the last meeting, too.  You know, we —since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting, it ’ll 
really be a three- month period of data that we can look at.  And  I think that’s a full quarter, and I 
think you can—you can draw more conclusions from that than you can  from any six —any six -
week period. 
We’ll look at those things.  We’ ll also look at the evolving risk picture.  We’ll look at 
what ’s happening in the financial sector.  We’ll look at all the data, the evolving outlook, and 
we’ll make a decision.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions .  Jeanna Smialek , New York 
Times .  You obviously, in your forecasts , marked up the sort of path for growth, mark ed down 
the path for unemployment , and marked up the path for inflation pretty notably.  I wonder, you 
know , since March, what has changed to make you think that the economy’ s a lot more resilient 
and inflation is going to be a lot m ore stubborn?  And given that, you know, why do you feel 
confident that this is as high as you ’re going to have to revise the federal funds rate?  Or do you 
think it ’s possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 percent terminal by the end of this , this 
cycle?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I —I mean, on the first part, I just think we ’re following 
the data and also the outlook.  The economy is —the labor market, I think, has surprised many, if 
not all , analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience, really.  And it ’s, 
it’s just remarkable.  And that ’s really, if you think about it —that ’s what ’s driving it.  It ’s job 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 26  
 creation.  It ’s, it’s wages moving up.  It’s, it’s supporting spending, which in turn is supporting 
hiring.  And it ’s, it’s really the engine, it seems, that is —that is driving the economy.  And so 
it’s, it’s really the , the data .  In terms of, you know —we , we always write down at these 
meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year.  That ’s, 
that’s how we do it.  It ’s based on our , our own individual assessments of what the most likely 
path of the economy is.  It can be—it can actually, in reality, wind up being lower or higher.  
And, you know, there ’s really no way to know.  But it ’s—it is —it’ s, it’s what people think as of 
today, and as the —as the data come in, it , it can move around during the intermeeting period.  It 
could wind up back in the same place.  But it really will be data driven.  I can ’t—I can ’t tell you 
that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the—w here the federal funds rate 
will be that far in advance.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking my question.  You had said back at 
the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance.  Is that s till the 
case, or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there?  And also, could you give us 
an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate?  Is the —obviously, the current rate, 
according to the Committee, is not sufficiently restrictive .  Is it 5.6?    Is it 6?  Where is 
sufficiently restrictive ?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I, I would say again that I think that , over time, the 
balance of risks, as we move from very, you know —from interest rates that are effectively zero 
now to 5 percentage points with , with an SEP calling for additional hikes —I think we ’ve moved 
much closer to our destination, which is that sufficiently restrictive rate , and I think that means 
by—almost by def inition that the —that the risks of , of sort of overdoing it and under , 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 26  
 underdoing it are , are getting closer to being in balance.  I still think , and my, my colleagues 
agree, that, that the risks to inflation are to the upside still.  So we don’ t—we don’ t think we ’re 
there with inflation yet because we ’re just looking at the data.  And  if you look at the —at the full 
range of , of inflation data, particularly the core data, you just —you just aren’ t seeing a lot of 
progress over the last year.  Headline,  of course, inflation has come down materially, but , as you 
know, we look at core [inflation] as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going . 
Sufficiently —so I think, you know , what , what we ’d like to see is credible evidence that 
inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down.  That ’s, that ’s what we want to see—
of course that ’s what we want to see.  And I , I think it ’s—it’s also—we understand that there are 
lags, but remember th at it’s, it’s more than a year since financial conditions began tightening.  I 
think it ’s—I think the reason we ’re, we’re comfortable pausing is that we are still—much of the 
tightening took place over last summer and later into the year.  And I think it ’s, it’s reasonable to 
think that some of that may come into effect.  So we ’re, you know —I think stretching out into a 
more moderate pace is appropriate to , to allow you to make that judgment of sufficiency, you 
know, more —with more data over time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  I wanted to ask further on the lag effects—when you’ re considering 
when you would hike again throughout the course of the year, are there things that you would 
expect to kick in as those lag effects come , come into effect that would inform your decisions?  
Have you learned things over t he past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to 
expect those lags to come into effect?  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So it ’s a—it’ s a challenging thing in, in economics.  It’s, it’s 
sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable 
lags.  Of course, these days, financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes.  So if you—if you look back when we were lifting off, we started talking about lifting off—by the time we had lifted off , the two -year [interest rate], which is a pretty good estimate of 
where [monetary] policy is going, had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points.  
So in that sense, tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where —
where news was in newspapers and not, you know, not on, on the wire.  So that ’s, that ’s 
different.  But it ’s still the case that what you see i s interest -sensitive spending is affected very, 
very quickly —so housing, and durable goods , and things like that .  But broader demand , and 
spending, and, and asset values, and things like that —they just take longer. 
And you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on 
that.  So there ’s not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it ta kes.  So, you 
know, then that makes it challenging, of course.  So we ’re, we’re looking at the calendar.  We’re, 
we’re looking at what ’s happening in the economy.  We’ re having to make these judgments.  
Again, i t’s one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate 
pace now as we seek that , that  ultimate —I can ’t point to —that ultimate endpoint.  I can ’t point to 
a specific data point.  I think we ’ll see it when we see inflation, you know, really, really 
flattening out reliably and then starting to soften.   I think we ’ll know that we ’re—that it’ s 
working.  A nd, ideally , by, by taking a little more time, we won ’t go well past the level where we 
need to go.  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 26  
 RACHEL SIEGEL.  I was curious if you could give us an update on what you’ re seeing 
on credit tightening since the bank incidents for March and how you’ re teasing that out apart 
from these lag effects.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s, it’s too early still to , to try to assess the full extent of what 
that might mean.  And, you know , that ’s something we ’re going to be watching, of course.  And, 
you know, if we were to see what , what  we would view as significant tightening beyond what 
would normally be expected because of , of this channel, then, you know, we would factor that 
into acc ount on, on—in , in making rate decisions.  So that ’s, that ’s how we think about it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Chris.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thanks.  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You mentioned that 
many of the trends are in place that you want to see —core services ex. housing has come in 
pretty low in the past couple of months.  And , as you noted, a significant portion of core inflation 
is now housing prices. And then we ’ve had some quirks in used- car prices.  
So given that these trends are in place, I guess I ’m sort of asking the flip side of Nick ’s 
question :  Why signal additional rate hikes?  Aren ’t things headed in the direction you need?   
Why not simply give it even more time?  Or —it’s surprising to see so much hawkishness in the 
dots, given what w e’re seeing recently.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So, you know, we ’ve—remember, we ’ve—we’re two and a 
half years into this —or two and a quarter years into this.  And forecasters, including Fed 
forecasters, have consistently thought that inflation was about to tu rn down and, you know, 
traditional— you know, typically  forecasted that it would and been wrong. 
So I think if you—I think if you look at the —at core PC E inflation overall—look at it 
over the last six months —you’ re just not seeing a lot of progress.   It’s running, and it ’s running 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 26  
 at a level, you know, over 4½ percent —far above our , our target and not really, you know, 
moving down.  We want to see it moving down decisively.  That ’s all.  We’re, you know, of 
course, we ’re going to get inflation down to 2 percent  over time.   We, we  don’ t want to do—we , 
we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy, of course.  
But we have to get inflation down to 2 percent , and we will.  And we just don’ t see that 
yet.  So , hence, you see toda y’s policy decision:   both, both to write down further rate hikes by 
the end of this year but also to, you know, to take —to, to moderate somewhat the pace with 
which we ’re moving.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Q uick follow -up.  I mean, the last press conference you mentioned 
you didn’ t see wages driving inflation.  And, you know, there was some research from the San 
Francisco Fed suggesting wages aren ’t necessarily a key driver.  But you’ ve talked about the 
labor market today and the need for softening.  Can you give us a little more, specifically, of how 
you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I ’m, I’m not going to comment on any particular paper, 
but I, I would say that the —I think the over all picture is that at the beginning in, you know, early 
2021, inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for —largely for goods.  People 
were still at home .  They had money in the bank, and they wanted to spend—they spent a lot on 
goods. 
And, of course, at the same time—and because of that high demand, to some extent, 
supply chains got all snarled up.  So prices went way up.  Inflation went way up.  So that was 
the, the origin , and it wasn’ t really particularly about the labor market or wages.  B ut as you—as 
you moved into—through ’ 21, into ’22, and now in ’ 23, I think many, many analysts believe that 
it will be important—an important part of getting inflation down, especially in the nonhousing 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 26  
 services sector, to getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable, that is consistent with 
2 percent  inflation.  
We actually have seen wages broadly move down but just at  a quite gradual pace.  So —
and that ’s, you know, that ’s a little bit of the finding of the Bernanke paper with Blanchard of a 
few weeks ago, which is very consistent with, with  what I , I would think.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKE E.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  You said 
in the past that you don’ t like to surprise markets.  It’ s kind of been the Fed’ s view markets 
should have an idea of what you’ re going to do before you go in.  You also said a number of 
times that it would take a while to bring inflation down.  You reiterated that again today and that 
we, we’d get to a point where inflation could be sticky.  
So I’m wondering, as we go into the next meetings, how Wall Street or others should 
look at your reacti on function.  What will you be reacting to —time or data?  In other words, if 
nothing much changes —if we ’re looking at the same sort of labor market, the same sort of 
inflation levels in July or in September or November—will you move because you’ ve said you 
feel you need to?  Is it time that’ s going to require additional movement , or would it be reversal 
in inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I don’ t want to deal with , with  hypotheticals about different 
ways data might move.  And so, we, you know —we of course —we ’re not —we don’ t go out of 
our way to surprise markets or the public.  At the same time, our main focus has to be on getting the policy right.  And that ’s, that ’s wha t we’re doing here , and that ’s what we ’ll do for the 
upcoming meetings.  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 26  
 I will say the July meeting will be “ live,” and we ’ll just have to see.  I think you’ ll, you’ ll 
see the data,  you’ ll hear Fed people talking about it , and, and markets will have to make a—
make a judgment.  
MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down 
based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement?  Or are we going to be in a 
period where we ’re not going to know what ’s happening?  
CHAIR P OWELL.  You know, I , I think if you look at —if, if you just look at —I’ll just 
point you to the forecast.  So inflation is running —core PCE inflation is running at about 4½, a 
little higher than 4½ percent.  And the , the median FOMC participant thinks it will go down to 
3.9 on a 12- month basis.  This is by the end of this year.  
So that ’s expecting pretty substantial progress.  That ’s, that’s a pretty significant decline 
for half a year.  So that ’s, that’s  the forecast.  You know, we ’ll—we do try to be transparent in 
our reaction function.  W e’re, we’re committed to getting inflation down.  And that ’s the 
number -one thing.  So that ’s how I thin k about it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  Could you talk about the balance 
sheet and how you’ re thinking about it?   What , what are you looking for to judge whether we ’re 
approaching reserve scarcity?  And is Treasury issuance going to affect that?  Also, are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off banks?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say, first of all, on the Treasury part of it— if I can talk 
about that and then go back to the balance sheet.  So on that —of course , we’ve been very 
focused on that for a couple of months, as everyone has.  [The] Treasury has laid out its borrowing plans publicly.  I think we all saw —I saw the Secretary ’s comments yesterday to the 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 26  
 effect that [the] Treasury has consulted widely with market participants about how to avoid 
market disruption and that they ’re going to watch carefully for that.  
So that ’s, that ’s from the Treasury, which actually sets the, y ou know, the , the 
borrowings .  At the Fed , we’ll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the Treasury refills 
the, the TGA.  The adjustment process is very likely to involve both a reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves.  It’s really hard to say at the —at the beginning of this which will 
be—which will be greater.  
We are starting at a very high level of reserves—and still elevated over RRP take -up, for 
that matter —so we don’ t think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over 
the course of the year.  So that ’s, that ’s—that ’s the—that ’s the Treasury part of the answer.  We 
will, of course, continue to monitor conditions in money markets, and we ’re prepared to make 
adjustments to make sure that , that  monetary policy transmission works.  
Was there another part of your question?  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Yeah —are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take 
some pressure off banks? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we , we have a number of —I would say the [ON] RRP [facility ] 
doesn’ t look like it’ s, it’s pulling money out of —out of  the banking system.  It’ s actually been 
shrinking here lately.  So I don’ t think —that ’s not something, something we ’ve thought about a 
lot over time .  It doesn ’t really look like that ’s, that ’s som ething that we would do. I think it ’s—I 
think it ’s a tool that we have. 
If we want to use it, we can.  There are other tools we can —we can  use to address money 
market issues.  But I wouldn’ t say that that’ s something that ’s likely that we would do in the near 
term.  
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 26  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Jonnelle.  
JONNELLE MARTE.  Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.  Have you seen sufficient 
cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down?  For example, how does the recent 
rebound affect your forecasts , and how does it fact or into monetary policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So certainly housing—very interest sensitive , and it ’s the first place, 
really, or one of the first places , that’s either helped by low rates or, or  that is held back by, by 
higher rates.  And we certainly saw that o ver the course of the last year.  We now see housing 
putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit.  
You know, we ’re watching that situation carefully.  I do think we —we will see rents , 
rents and , and  house prices filtering into , into housing se rvices inflation.  And I , I don’ t see them 
coming up quickly.  I, I do see them kind of —kind of wandering around at a relatively low level 
now, and that ’s appropriate.  
JONNELLE MARTE.   Do you think you’ ll have to target that with further rate increases?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think we , we look at everything.  We don’ t just look at 
housing.  So I think, you know, the way it works is the individual participants sit in their offices all over the country, and they write down their forecast and —including their most likely 
forecasts— including their rate forecast.  And then they send it in on Friday afternoon, and we 
cumulate it, and then we publish it for you. 
So that ’s how —that ’s how they do that.  Well, I don’t know that housing is , is itself 
going to be driving the rates picture, but it ’s part of it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Edward. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.  Edward 
Lawrence with Fox Business.  So I want to go back to comments you made about , in the past , 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 26  
 about unsustainable fiscal path.  The CBO projects the federal deficit to be $2.8 trillion in 
10 years.  The CBO also says that federal debt will be $52 trillion by 2033.  At what point do you talk more firmly w ith lawmakers about fiscal responsibility?  Because —assuming monetary 
policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher -level 
spending.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t do that.  That’s really not my job.  We—we  hope and expect 
that other policymakers will respect our independence on , on monetary policy.  And we don’ t see 
ourselves as, as , you know, the judges of appropriate fiscal policy.  I will say, and many of my 
predecessors have said , that we ’re on an unsus tainable fiscal path and , and  that needs to be 
addressed over time.  But I think trying to get into , into that with lawmakers would be —would 
be kind of inappropriate , given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Is there any conversation then about the F ederal Reserve 
financing some of that debt that we ’re seeing coming down the pike?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No .  Under no circumstances.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Courtenay.  
COURTENAY BROWN.  Thanks for taking our questions , Chair Powell.  So  looking at 
the SEP, it looks like GDP for this year was raised significantly —your forecast for GDP this 
year.  The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was pulled downward.  And so should we take that as a sign that the C ommittee is more confident about the pros pects of a soft landing —at least 
more —at least as it relates to what you were expecting in , in March ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know , I—I would just say it this way.  I continue to think —and 
this really hasn ’t changed—that there is a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent  
without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and, and large losses of employment that we’ ve 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 26  
 seen in so many past instances.  It ’s, it’s possible .  A—in a way, a strong labor market is —that , 
that gradually cools  could, could aid that along— it could aid that along.  But I , I guess I want to 
come back to the , the main thing, which is , though, simply this.  We, we  see—the C ommittee —
as you can see from the SEP, the C ommittee is completely unified in the need to get inflation 
down to 2 percent  and will do whatever it takes to get it down to 2 percent  over time.  That is our 
plan.  And, you know, we , we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the —in 
the U .S. economy is the thing that we cannot, cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today’ s 
workers and families and businesses but also for the future.  Getting price stability back and , and 
restored will benefit generations of people as long as it ’s sustained.  And it really is the bedrock 
of the economy.  And , and you should understand that that is our top priority.  
COURTENAY BROWN.  Just a quick follow -up on that.  I’m just a little confused 
because you said the C ommittee will do whatever it takes to get in flation down over time , but 
when I look at the  SEP, inflation is still projected to be elevated next year, but the fed funds rate 
is lower than where it is now.  Can you help me understand that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, you know, if you look two and three  years out with , with  
the forecast —first of all, I wouldn ’t—I wouldn’ t put too much weight on forecasts even one year 
out because they’ re, they ’re so highly uncertain.  But what they’ re showing is that as inflation 
comes down in the —in the forecast, if you don’ t lower interest rates, then real rates are actually 
going up, r ight?  So just to maintain a real rate, the nominal rate at that point—two years out, 
let’s say —should come down just to maintain real rates.  And i f—and actually, you know, since 
we’re, we’re probably going to—we ’re, we’re having real rates that are going to have to be 
meaningfully positive and significantly .  So for us to get inflation down, t hat probably means —
that, that certainly means that, that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 26  
 coming down really significantly.  And again, we ’re talking about a couple of years out.  I think , 
as, as  anyone can see, not a single person on the Committee wrote down a rate cut this year, nor 
do I think it is at all likely to  be appropriate , if you think about it.  Inflation has not really moved 
down.  It has —it ha s not so far reacted much to our —to our existing rate hikes.  And so we ’re 
going have to keep at it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Julie.  
JULIE CHABANAS.  I ’m sorry.  Thank you.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Julie Chabanas, AFP 
News Agency.   The May job report showed a rebound in May in the B lack workers ’ 
unemployment.  Is it consistent with the Fed ’s maximum -employment mandate?  Are you 
worried about that —about this rebound?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we are, of course, worried about —there are—there are long -
standing differences in racial and ethnic groups across , across  our labor market.  That ’s a factor 
that we don’ t—we can ’t really address with our tools.  But we do conside r that when we ’re 
thinking about what constitutes maximum employment —it is, for us , a broad and inclusive goal.  
And so we do watch that.  But remember, all unemployment, including Black unemployment, 
has been bouncing around right near historic lows —histo ric modern lows here.  So we ’re still 
talking about , I mean, what is as strong a labor market as we’ ve seen in , you know, a half -
century here in the United States.  So overall unemployment of 3.7 percent i s, is higher —three -
tenths  higher  than it was measured to be at the last —a month ago.  But , still, it’ s extraordinarily 
low.  And so it ’s a very, very tight labor market.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Megan.  
MEGAN CAS SELLA.  Thank you.  I want to follow up first a little bit just on the rent 
question on housing.  We heard Governor Waller  talk about how —I’ll back up.  W e haven’ t 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 26  
 quite seen the slowdown in rents show up in CPI yet.  And we did hear Governor Waller talk 
about how an uptick in housing might mean that there ’s not going to be as much relief coming or 
a shorter bit of relief than we thought.  Can you talk about how you’ re thinking about that and 
how that played into today’ s outcome? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t say—that ’s, you know —as a factual matter, t hat’s correct.  
We do need to see, you know , rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their 
increases because we want —we want t he, you know, we want inflation to come down.  And 
rental is , is a very large part of the CPI—about a third—and it’s about half of that for the PC E.  
So it’s important.  And so we ’re—it’s something that we ’re watching very carefully.  It’s part of 
the overall picture.  I wouldn’ t say it ’s the decisive part, but take a step back.  What you see is—
look at —look at core inflation over the past six months, a  year.  You ’re just not seeing a lot of 
progress —not the kind of progress we want to see.  And that , that’s—it’s hard to avoid that.  
And, you know, the C ommittee —people on the C ommittee —the median went up significantly, 
so that the median participant now thinks that core PC E inflation  on a 12 -month basis will be 
3.9 percent this year.  So , once again, every year for the past three years, it ’s gone up over the 
course of the year , and that ’s doing that again.  So we see that , and we see that inflation forecasts 
are coming in low again,  and we see that —that that tells us that we need to do more.  And so 
we’re—that ’s why you see the SEP with—where it is.  
MEGAN CAS SELLA.  Could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages a nd, 
given the recent slowdown in core services excluding housing, how far you think w ages might 
need to fall in order to get inflation back in line ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So wages will continue to increase.  So we , we,  you know —what 
we’re talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that ’s 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 26  
 consistent with 2 percent  inflation over time.   And so I , I think we ’ve seen some progress—all,  
all of the major measures of wages have, have  moved down from extremely elevated— not 
extremely  elevated —highly elevated levels a year or so ago, and they’ re, they ’re moving back 
down but , but quite gradually.  And , and, you know, we want to see that , that  process continue 
gradually.  Of course, it ’s great to see wage increases, particularly for peo ple at the lower end of 
the income spectrum.  But we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to 
2 percent , which benefits everyone.  I mean, inflation hurts those same people more than anyone 
else.  People on a fixed income are hurt the worst , and the fastest , by high inflation.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you so much, Chair  Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  I just 
wondered if the Committee has talked at all about the labor market and , and—there, there ’s 
strikes now in  Hollywood and now the United Autoworkers are talking about a possible strike.  I 
mean, aren ’t workers —they have —we have some—workers have power now and a re going to be 
seeking higher wages.  Does t hat come up in your discussions ?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So the topic of wages in the labor market and dynamics in the labor 
market could—is about as central a topic to our discussions as, as  anything.  I mean, i t’s, it’s 
very—labor economics, you know, and the labor market are utterly central.  You know, it ’s half 
of our mandate.  So we spend a lot of time talking about that.  I think, you know, we —there , 
there  are structural issues that are really not for the Fed.  And so we don’ t spend a lot of time — 
although we take notice of , of what ’s going on, but we ’re not , you know —we ’re not involved in 
discussions or debates over, over strikes and things like that.  But we—you know, we , we look, 
and we see what ’s going on.  And, you know, we ’re making judgments about what it will take to 
get inflation down to 2 percent  in the aggregate.  And as I said, don’ t think that was about —I 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 26  
 didn’ t—most folks would say now  it wasn ’t really about that —about wages at the beginning.  
And it ’s becoming more about that as we —as we get into really service- sector inflation, which is 
the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Mark for the las t question.  
MARK HAMRICK .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mark Hamrick with  Bankrate. 
Wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk n ow that we ’re about three months 
past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank .  And also, specifically, what are the risks associated with 
commercial real estate as well as nonbank financials?  And could you further elevate those risks 
with higher still rates, possibly for longer?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’m trying to think where to start.  I’ll sta rt with commercial real 
estate.  We —of course, we ’re watching that situation very carefully.  There ’s a substantial 
amount of commercial real estate in the banking system.  A , a large part of it is in smaller banks.  
It’s well distributed —to the extent it ’s well distributedthen , then the system could, could take 
losses.  We do expect that there will be losses, but they ’ll be—the y’ll be banks that have 
concentrations , and those banks will experience larger losses.  So we ’re well aware of that.  
We’re monitor ing it carefully.  You know, it feels like —it feels like something that will be 
around for some time , as opposed to, you know, something that will suddenly hit and, and, you 
know, work its way into systemic risk. 
In terms of nonbank financials —financial sector —there ’s been a ton of work.  And, you 
know, clearly in the —in the pandemic, it really was —it was the nonbank financial sector w here, 
where issues really arose.  And, you know, there ’s a lot of work going on in—with the 
Administration , in particular, leading that to try to address issues in the Treasury market and , and 
in all kinds of areas in the  nonbank financial market.  And —but, you know, our jurisdiction at 
June 14, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 26  
 the Fed is over banks —actually bank holding companies and some banks.  So that ’s, that’s really 
our main focus .  
You know, in terms of the events of March—as I mentioned earlier, we will be carefully 
monitoring that situation.  You know, our , our job generally involves worrying about a lot of 
things that may go wrong, and that would i nclude the banks.  It might be hard for me to identify 
something that we don’ t worry about rather than that we do worry about.  So we ’re watching 
those things very carefully.  And as we see things unfold—as we see what ’s happening with 
credit conditions and, and  also all the individual banks that are out there, you know, we ’ll be able 
to take , to the extent it ’s appropriate , we can take, if they ’re macroeconomic implications, we 
can take that into account in our rate setting.  And so I guess that ’s what I would say. 
MARK HAMRICK .  Can I just follow up on the last part  of that?  Do you—do you risk 
further exacerbat ing those issues if you get  up to another 50 basis points?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that ’s—and, and I was —I guess I meant to address that by saying 
as we—as we watch, we’ ll see  what ’s happening.  And if we —if we ’re seeing the kind of 
tightening of conditions that , that  you could be referring to, then we can factor that —because 
really, we ’re—we use our —our rate tool is , is, you know, is —it really has macroeconomic 
purposes.  So we ’ll, we ’ll take that into account.  Of course, we have responsibility for financial 
stability as well.  And that also is a factor that we’ re always going to be considering.  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
July 26, 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  
We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.  Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve.  Without price stability, the economy doesn ’t work for anyone.  In particular, 
without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
Since early l ast year, the FOMC has significantly tightened  the stance of monetary 
policy.  Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate ¼ percentage point, and 
we are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.  We ’ve covered a lot of 
ground, and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt .  Looking ahead, we will 
continue to take a data -dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming 
that may be appropriate.  I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing 
economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a mode rate pace.  
Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year.  Although a ctivity 
in the housing se ctor has picked up somewhat, it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely 
reflecting higher mortgage rates.  And higher interest rates and slower output growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.  
The labor market remains very tight.  Over the past three months, job gains averaged  
244,000 jobs per month, a pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace.  The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6 percent.  There are some continuing s igns that supply and

Page 2 of 28 
 demand in the labor market are coming into better balance.  T he labor force participation rate has 
moved up since last year , particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.  Nominal wage growth 
has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.  While the 
jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of 
available workers.  
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Over the 12 months 
ending in M ay, total PCE prices rose 3.8 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 4. 6 percent.  In June, the 12-month change in the consumer 
price index, or CPI, came in at 3.0 percent, and the change in the core, core  CPI, was  4.8 percent.  
Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year.  Nonetheless, the process 
of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  Despite elevated inflation, 
longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range 
of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial 
markets.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the A merican people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant —significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, 
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and 
transportatio n.  We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our 
mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. 
At today’s meeting , the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
¼ percentage point, bringing the target range to 5 ¼ to 5½ percent.  W e are also continuing the 
process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  With today’s action, we ’ve raised our 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 28  
 policy rate by 5¼ percentage points since early last year .  We have been seeing the effects of our 
policy tightening on demand in the most interest  rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, 
particularly housing and investment.  It will take time, howeve r, for the full effects of our 
ongoing monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.  In addition, t he economy is 
facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions  for households and businesses, which are likely 
to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. 
In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return 
inflation to 2  percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening 
of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary  policy affects economic activity and inflation, 
and economic and financial developments.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by 
meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for 
economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks.  
We remain committed to bring ing inflation back to our 2 percent goal and to keeping 
longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is likely to require a period 
of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions.  Restoring price stability 
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  run. 
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  S teve.  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 28  
 STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  You have, I think a couple of times in 
your opening remarks , talked about this language “ in determining the extent of additional policy 
firming that may be appropriate. ”  Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on 
the way?  And should we also believe that all future meetings —say , September and November —
are live, or are you in a n every -other -meeting mode?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we haven’ t made a d ecision to go to every other meeting.  It ’s not 
something we ’ve looked at.  We ’re going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into 
each meeting, we’ re going to be asking ourselves the same questions.  So we haven’ t made any 
decisions about , about  any future meetings, including the pace at which we ’d consider hiking.  
But we ’re going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate —you 
read the language—“ to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”  
I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations :  
Economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit, and the 
June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change.  And the June CPI 
report, of course , was welcomed , but it ’s only one report, one month’ s data.  We hope that 
inflation will follow a lower path , as was—that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we 
don’t know that , and we ’re just going to need to see more data. 
So, what  are we going to be looking at?  Really , it will be the broader, the whole broader 
picture, and starting with —we ’re looking for moderate growth, right?  We ’re looking for supply 
and demand through the economy coming into better balance , including, in parti cular , in the 
labor market.  We’ ll be looking at inflation.  W e’ll be asking ourselves , does this whole 
collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further?  And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates.  So that ’s how we ’re thinking about 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 28  
 the next meeting and, you know, how we ’re thinking about meetings going forward potentially, 
but, you know, we ’re now mainly thinking about the next meeting.  
I will also say, since we ’re talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we 
get two more job reports, two more CPI reports .  I think we have an ECI report coming later this 
week —which is [an] employment compensation index—and lots of data on economic activity.  
All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting.  I would say it 
is certainly possible t hat we would raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warrant  
it, and I would also say it ’s possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.  We’ re 
going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting, and I ’ll close by saying 
we’ve raised the f ederal  funds r ate now by 525 basis points since March 2022 .  Monetary policy, 
we believe, is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  If I could just briefly follow  up on something you said there :  You 
said the data in the intermeeting period, it probably came in in  line with expectations.  Does that 
mean there ’s unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that 
two more hikes are necessary?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I’m just going to go back to what I said.  We, we —you know, that ’s 
the question.  We have eight weeks now until the September meeting , and all that data that I 
recited, we’ re going to be looking at all that and making that assessm ent then.  And it really —we 
did have the one good reading, and, of course , we welcome that .  But it’s just one reading, as 
everybody knows .  And, and, you know, we ’ve seen —we ’ve seen this before in the data.  Many 
forecasts call for, for rates —for , for inflation to remain low, but we just don’ t know that until we 
see the data.  So we ’ll be focusing on that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.

Page 6 of 28  
 JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thank you.  Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell.  
Obviously, you updated the language around growth in the statement today.  Y ou know, we ’ve 
seen the Barbie  movie numbers .  We’ve seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this 
summer.  It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape,  and it does see m like 
growth is sort of picking back up a little bit or at least doing well.  And I wonder , from your 
perspective , if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know, 
performing well this summer, is that a problem because it’ s inflationary , or is it good news 
because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely?  Just how are you thinking about that sort 
of trajectory?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Yeah .  So I would say it this way:   The overall resilience of the 
economy, the fact that , that  we’ve been able to achieve disinflation so far without any 
meaningful negative impact o n the labor market, the strength of the economy —overall, that’ s a 
good thing.  It’s good to see that, of course.  It ’s also —you see consumer , consumer  confidence 
coming up and things like that .  That will support activity going forward.  But you’ re, you’re  
right , though.  A t the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation, and that 
would require an appropriate response for monetary policy.  So we ’ll be watching that carefully 
and seeing how it evolves over time.  
MICHELE SMITH.  Neil.   
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin from Axios.  So , as you referenced 
earlier,  in the intermeeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating, JOLTS look 
good.  So if you’ re data dependent, why not pause again?  Why not stay on hold?  Why not take 
another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the directio n you want to see?  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So if you go back to what we ’re trying to do here, we ’re trying to 
achieve a stance of policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2  percent.  At 
the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimat es of that  would take —of what that would 
take, and the median  of that was, was  an additional two rate hikes.  So I would sa y, we looked at 
the interim intermeeting data  and, as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent, 
but broadly consiste nt with expectations .  And, as a result, we went ahead and , and took another 
step.  And that ’s, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but , but gradually 
slowing.  I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but , you 
know, we ’re, we’re  going to be careful about taking too much signal from , from a single reading.  
And, you know, growth came in stronger than expected.  So that ’s how we look at it, and, and so 
we did take that step today. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, markets 
widely believe the median FOMC participant ’s inflation forecast from June for  the fourth  quarter 
of this year will be too high , given autos and shelter , and t hat by S eptember , that may warrant a 
downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points.  Would that type of inflation 
progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below -trend growth and 
decelerating labor income growt h to be convinced that you ’ve done enough?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of 
this and how much of that .  You know, we ’ll be looking at everything.  And , you know, we ’ll, of 
course , we’ll be looking to see whether the signal from June’ s CPI is replicated or , or the 
opposite of replicated or whether it’ s somewhere in the middle.  We’ ll be looking at the growth 
data.  We’ll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 28  
 judgment about that.  It ’s the totality of the data, I think , but with a particular focus on, on 
making progress on inflation.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could follow up :  Last month you said there were benefits to 
moderating the pace of increases because it wou ld give you more information to make decisions.  
Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that 
slower pace and defer until the f all any decision on whether you need that second rate hike?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’m just going to tell you again what we ’re going to do.  I n 
September, we ’re going to look at , at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots 
of activity data, and that ’s what we ’re going to look at , and we ’re going to make that decision 
then.  And that decision could, could  mean another hike in , in September, or it could mean that 
we decide to maintain at that level.  And, again, the question we ’re going to be asking ourselves 
is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more , that we need to tighten further ?  And if we 
get that signal, whenever we get it, then—and that ’s the collective judgment of the Committee —
then we will move ahead.  If we don’ t, you know, then, then we’ll have the option of maintaining 
policy at that level, but it ’s, it’s,  you know, it ’s really dependent so much on the data , and we just 
don’t have it yet.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Hi .  Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.  So consumer 
confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part becaus e of, of the declines in headline 
inflation .  You also see wages are also rising faster than prices now after trailing them for a long 
time.  How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 
3 percent ?  And with that  in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side 
of the dual mandate?  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I ’d say it this way :  First, it is —it is  a good thing that 
headline inflation has come down so much, because that ’s really what the public experiences .  
And, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a —it 
will strengthen the broad sense that , that  the publ ic has that inflation is coming down, which will 
in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down.  So you are really —sorry, your question 
was? 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Well, I mean , you ’ve talked for many press conferences 
now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people.  So how much of that are we 
still seeing with inflation now down at 3 [percent]?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  I guess I would put it this way.  W e, we—I’d say it this way :  It’s 
really a question of , how  do you balance the two r isks, the risk of doing too much or doing too 
little?  And, you know, I would say that , you know, we ’re coming to a place where, where  there 
really are risks on both sides.  It ’s hard to say exactly whether , whether  they ’re in balance or not, 
but as our —as our  stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do 
increasingly face that risk.   But , you know, we , we need to see that inflation is durably down 
that far, you know . 
As you know, we think, and most economists think, that core inflation is actually a better 
signal of , of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by 
volatile energy and food prices .  So we would want core inflation to be coming down, because 
that’s what we think—that ’s—core is sign aling where headline  is going to go in the future.  And 
core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know?  There ’s reason to think it can come down now, 
but it ’s, it’s still quite elevated , and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we ’re 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 28  
 going to need to hold, certainly, hold policy at a restrictive level for some time.  And we need to 
be prepared to raise further if that—if we think that ’s appropriate.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Well, and then if inflation were to —just a  quick 
follow [up]: If it stays at 3 or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in 
unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation?  People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so -called last mile of inflation.   So—but  how much?  
Again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last  one— 
CHAIR POWELL.  So it is —it is  a very positive thing that, actually, the unemployment 
rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of ’22, at 3.6 percent .  So that ’s a real 
blessing in that we ’ve been able to achieve some disinflation, and we don’ t seek to it .  It’s not 
that we ’re aiming to , to raise unemployment, but I would just say, the historical record —we have 
to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and 
slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor  market 
conditions.  And so that is still the , the likely outcome here.  And, you know, we hope that that ’s 
as little as possible, but  we have to be honest that that is —that is  the likely outcome.  
The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not 
get it done .  Whatever the short -term social cost s of getting inflation under control, the longer -
term social costs of failing to do so are greater , and the historical record is very, very clear on 
that.  If you go through a pe riod where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is 
volatile, it interferes with people ’s lives and with economic activity , and, you know, that ’s the—
that’s the  thing we , we really need to avoid and will avoid.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Michael McKee.  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 28  
 MICHAEL MCKEE.  At this point, you say the policy is restrictive , but all year long we 
have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation,  lately, to 
the downside.  So I ’m wondering, by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now 
under these conditions ?  Do you think you might need to do more , because I ’m curious about 
what you see as inflation dynamics now ?  Is the economy still moving in a direction where it 
creates more inflation?  People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have 
some large labor settlements.  Or is the economy disinflating, and you’ re just, you’ re able to go 
back to the old F ed policy of opportunistic disinflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’ll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is, 
we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic -related distortions to 
demand and supply.  W e want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to 
help ease inflationar y pressures.  W e want to see continued restoration of supply and demand 
balance, particularly in the labor market.  A nd all of that should lead to declining inflationary 
pressures.  
Now what we see is, we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together .  And we ’re 
seeing evidence of those things now, but I would —I would say that what , what  our eyes are 
telling us is that policy has not been restrictive long , restrictive  enough for long enough to have 
its full desired effects.  So we intend, again, to keep pol icy restrictive until we ’re confident that 
inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we ’re prepared to further 
tighten if that is appropriate.  And we think the process, you know, still probably has a , a long 
way to  go. 
MICHAEL MCKE E.  Well , do you think under current conditions you are restrictive 
enough unless something changes?  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think —we think, you know, today’ s rate hike was 
appropriate , and I think we ’re going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at 
the next meeting about , is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more ?  And if it does 
tell us that —collectively , if that ’s our view —then we will do more.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby.  
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   If September is , 
in fact, a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the f unds rate steady at the 
June meeting?  
CHAIR POWE LL.  So a more gradual pace doesn ’t go immediately to [moving] every 
other meeting.  It could be two out of three meetings, right?  It could be —it just means if you ’re 
slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as , as we get closer and 
closer to , we think, our destination.  And I wouldn’ t want to go automatically to [moving] every 
other meeting , because I just don ’t think that ’s—we don’ t—I think it ’s not an environment 
where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance .  There’s a lot of uncertainty out there . 
We just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes 
all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so that’s what we did.  And so I , I think it’ s possible .  I mentioned it before .  It’s possible that we 
would move at consecutive meetings —we ’re not taking that off the table —or we might not.  It ’s 
really going to depend on what the data tell us.  That’s the best we can do.  
COLBY SMITH.  So we shouldn’ t assume that every other meeting is the lowest 
tightening frequency, let ’s say ?  It could be , you know, longer intervals in between as well ? 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  I think we ’re—look, I think we ’re going to—we’re going to  make a 
decision about the next meeting, an d then we ’re going to make a decision about the one after 
that.  And I think it ’ll sort itself out.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  So, among your 
colleagues, there have been people who’ ve said they feel that very little transmission has taken 
place so far from monetary policy into the economy, and there are those who feel, they say, it ’s 
happened very fast this time , and it ’s kind of up to date.  Where are you on that continuum?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the re’s a long -running debate about the lags between changes in 
financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right?  So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move in  anticipation of our 
decisions , and that has clearly been the case in this cycle.  So , in a sense, the clock starts earlier 
than it —than it  used to.  
But that doesn’ t necessarily change the process from that point on , and it ’s not clear that 
it has.  We also —this is —I’ll tell you what we  know and then what we don’ t know.  We know 
that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags , plural, that can be long and variable —a lot of uncertainty around the length of 
the lags.  A nd, by the way, that ’s just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face.  
So I’ll tell you how I—how I  think about this .  First, the first thing to say is, we ’re 
determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time , and we will use our tools to do that .  
No one should doubt that.  I would look at it this way, though.  T he real federal funds r ate is now 
in meaningfully positive territory.  If you take the nominal f ederal funds r ate, subtract the 
mainstream estimate of near -term inflation expectations, you get a real federal funds r ate that is 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 28  
 well above most estimates of the longer -term neutral rate.  So I would say, monetary policy is 
restrictive, more so after today ’s decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on 
economic activity and inflation.  We ’ll keep monetary policy restrictive  until we think it’ s not 
appropriate to do so.  So that ’s how I think about it. 
I mean , if I sum it up, I would say :  We’ve come a long way.  W e are resolutely 
committed to returning inflation to our 2  percent goal over time.  Inflation has proved, 
repeatedly , has proved stronger than we and other forecasts —forecasters have expected , and at 
some point , that may change.  We have to be ready to follow the data , and given how far we ’ve 
come, we can afford t o be a little patient , as well as resolute, as we let this unfold.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  On the —on the  credit side, I ’m wondering if you saw 
anything in the —in the  latest SLOOS data that made you think you’ re getting a quantum of 
credit contraction beyond wha t you’ d expect .  The bank lending data really is —the growth rate ’s 
edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually, you know, a recession 
indicator.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess that the SLOOS will come out  early next week , and I 
would just sa y it’s broadly condition —consistent with what you would expect.  You ’ve got 
lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter .  You’ve got weak demand, and, you know, it , 
it gives a picture of pretty tight credit conditions in the economy.  I think it’ s really hard to tease 
out whether —how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is , the 
overall picture is of tight and tightening lending condi tions.  And that ’s, that’s  what the SLOOS 
will say.

 RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Sieg el from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what 
share of that credit you would give to factors that don’ t stem directly from rate hikes or that 
might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So, interesting question.  So  let me start by saying that the 
inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and, and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and m onetary policy.  And we ’ve always expected that the 
disinflationary process would stem from , both from  the normalization of those broad pandemic -
related supply and demand conditions and from restrictive , restrictive  monetary policy , which 
would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand.  And we think 
that’s broadly what we ’re—what we’re  seeing.  
So to go, break it down a little further :  Of course , headline inflation has come down 
sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to [a] reversal of the effects [on those prices that resulted] from the war in Ukraine .  And that ’s, that’s  a 
good thing, and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier.  
For core inflation, I’ d say there also —there has been a role for , for most —for , for both 
factors, both that I mentioned.  Clearly , for goods, normalization of  supply conditions is playing 
an important role , as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal , of spending—back into 
services and away from goods. 
And take autos as an example .  The combination of an increase in sales and inventories, 
while , while  vehicle inflation has  decelerated, points to a substantial rol e for supply, but there ’s 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 28  
 also a role for demand , as, you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive .  So 
they’ re both working there.  Housing services inflation now starts to move down.  C learly , higher 
rates have, have  slowed the housing market.  You know, I would say, monetary policy is 
working about as we expect, and we think—we think  it’ll play an important role going forward, 
in particular in nonhousing services , where , really, we think that ’s, that’s  where the labor market 
will come in as a very , very  important factor.  So we think both of those —both of those  sources 
of disinflation are playing an important role.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  I see.  A nd just to follow  up, do you think that of those two sources, 
that core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes , or is there a more even split 
there , too? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward 
because we, we’ re sort  of reaping now the benefits of the —of the  reversal of some of the very 
specific pandemic things.  We’ re seeing that with goods , in particular, with s upply chains and 
shortages moving, and we ’re seeing —so I think going forward, monetary policy will be 
impo rtant, particularly in that, in the sector, in the nonhousing services sector.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  First, let me compliment your tie, 
the choice of tie.  I t’s a good color.  So thanks for taking our questions.  So the Beige Book, it 
said, “Input cost pressures remain ed elevated for services firms but eased notably ” for 
manufacturing sectors.  Is that an indication that there ’s a, a  wage inflation pressure?  And how 
do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into a recession?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  I think th at, as it relates to goods, it ’s really an indication that 
supply chains and, and shortages are easing.  And so , what was the first part of it?  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 28  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So, wage inflation.  Like , how do you—how do you target 
wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’t —I don ’t think we ’re targeting wage inflation.  I think what 
we’re—what we’re  looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions.  And that ’s what 
we’re seeing.  So wages have actually been gradually moving down.  T hey’re still at levels what 
would—that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation.  
Nonetheless, we ’re making progress there.  And by so many indicators, labor market demand is 
cooling.  You can —you can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that .  You can 
look at the quits rate normalizing .  You can look at job openings coming down.  You can look at 
just job creation in the , the establishment survey has, you know —it’ s still at a high level, but it 
was at , really , an extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years.  
So you see cooling, particularly in private sector , in the last, you know, in the last report.  
So I think we see that, and it ’s happening at a gradual pace.  So that ’s actually not a bad thing, in 
a sense, because if , if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is 
really the engine of the economy—p eople are getting hired, many people going back to work, 
getting wages, spending money—and that ’s really what ’s driving the economy but  that i t’s 
gradually slowing, it ’s gradually cooling, that ’s a good prescription for getting where we want 
to get. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  But still we see a push to raise minimum wage .  We’re seeing 
a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is , they come out with 
agreements like big pay increases, like UPS , and we have the autoworkers coming up.  Are you 
concerned  then about a trend of series of big unions, these contract s, pushing wage inflation 
then?  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Not for us to comment on , on contract negotiations.  Not our job, not 
our role.  You know, we , we monitor these things , and we ’ll keep an eye on them, but , really, 
that’s something that ’s, that’s  handled at that level and not — 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask about the S EP, 
which suggests that you would cut rates as overall  and core PCE get to around or under 
3 percent.  And so I ’m wondering, is the level of inflation what ’s sort of important there as you 
think about getting to 2 percent  and when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which 
inflation is falling also important?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think you’d  take both into account.  I think you’d  take everything 
into account when you start cutting rates.  It would —it would depend on the whole, on a wide 
range of things.  And when , when people  are writing  dow n rate cuts next year, you know, it just 
is a sense that inflation is coming down , and we ’re comfortable that it’ s coming down, and it ’s 
time to start cutting rates.  I think —but I mean , there ’s a lot of uncertainty between what 
happens , you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year , let alone the year after 
that.  So it ’s, it’s hard to say exactly what happens there , what’s motivating people.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  So if it’ s sort of —sort of stubbornly in maybe the high 2s, you 
wouldn’ t necessaril y cut rates ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m not going— I’m not saying that at all.  I ’m not giving you any 
numerical guidance  around that.  I’m saying we would—we ’d be comfortable cutting rates when 
we’re comfortable cutting rates, and that won ’t be this year , I don’ t think .  It would be —you 
know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year.  I think the median  was several for next 
year.  And that ’s just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now , 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 28  
 and it ’ll be about how confident we are that inflation is , in fact, coming down to our 2 percent 
goal.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.  A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the 
Fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing , and they’ ve reduced their forec ast for a 
recession.  And I ’m wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of  a recession 
being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident 
that you can achieve a soft landing.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s, it has been my view consistently that we do have a shot, and 
my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we ’ve seen in 
some past —in some past  instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours.  That ’s 
been my view .  That’s, that’s  still my view.  And I think, you know, that that ’s sort of consistent 
with, with  what I see today.  So —but it ’s a long way from assured, and, and, you know, we have 
a lot left to go to see that happen. 
So the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the 
forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer fore casting a 
recession.  I just want to note that it’ s—that our staff produces its own forecast , which is 
independent of the forecast s that we as FOMC participants produce.  H aving an independent 
staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecast s  is really a strength of our —of our  
process.  There ’s just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that , that  helps us make —
informs  our deliberations —helps us make , I hope , better decisions.  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 28  
 STEVE MATTHEWS.  And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and 
you still have a strong labor market?  I mean , does that add to the optimism?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t use the term “ optimism”  about this yet.  I would—I would 
say, though, that there ’s a pathway , and , yes, that ’s, that’s  a good way to think about it.  We’ ve, 
we’ve  seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market.  And 
that’s, that’s  a really good thing.  I would just also say the historical record suggest s that there ’s 
very likel y to be some softening in labor market conditions .  And consistent with having a soft 
landing, you would—you would have some softening in labor market conditions, and that ’s still 
likely as we —as we go forward with this process.  But it’ s a good thing to date that we haven ’t—
we haven’t  really seen that.  
We’ve seen softening through other —not through unemployment, not through higher 
unemployment .  We’ve seen softening through, you know, job openings coming down part of the 
way back to more normal levels ; the quits rate, so people are not quitting as much ; we’ve seen 
participation —people coming in, and so labor supply has , has improved, which has lowered the 
temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated , you know, going back a year or so.  
So we ’re seeing that kind of cooling, and that ’s, that’s  very healthy, and, you know, we hope it 
continues.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  J eff. 
JEFF COX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.  You and other Fed  
officials in the past have suggested that you don’ t need to keep hiking until inflation hits 
2 percent, that —as long as you see continued progress.  So I ’m wondering, how close do you 
need to get with the inflation numbers coming down?   How many months of data do you need to 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 28  
 see that will —that will give you sufficient confidence , and how , how  far does this fight need to 
go before you’ re willing to kind of declare victory on  it? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 
2 percent —it would be a prescription [for a policy] of going way past the target.  That ’s, that’s  
clearly not the appropriate way to think about it.  So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we , 
we—the median participant—and, again, these are forecast ing out years, so take them with a 
grain of salt.  But people are cutting rates next year because, because,  you know, the f ederal 
funds r ate is at a restrictive level now. 
So if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don’ t need to be at a 
restrictive level anymore .  We can , you know, we can move back to a —to a neutral level and 
then below a neutral level at a certain point.  I think we would, you know, we would—we , of 
course , would be very careful about that .  We’d really want to be sure that inflation is coming 
down in a sustainable level.  And it ’s hard to make —I’m not going to try to make a numerical 
assessment of when and where that would be.  Bu t that’ s the way I would think about it, is you ’d 
start—you’ d stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation , and you’ d start cutting before 
you got to 2 percent inflation , too, because we don’ t see ourselves getting to 2  percent inflation 
until—you know, all the way back to 2—until 2025 or so.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  It ’s been over four months since a handful  of regional banks, including Silicon 
Valley Bank, failed.  When you look at credit conditions now, given Banc  of California ’s 
acquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt , or are you 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 28  
 comfortable saying that we ’ve seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this 
point ?  And how does this play into your outlook for policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I don’ t want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I 
will say , things have settled down for sure out there.  Deposit flows have stabilized .  Capital and 
liquidity remain strong.  Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter and is up 
significantly year over year.  Banking- sector  profits generally are coming in strong this quarter.  
And, overall , the banking system remains strong and resilient.  Of course , we’re still watching , 
you know, the situation carefully and monitoring, you know, monitoring conditions in, in the 
banking sector. 
In terms of the , the actual effect on —if you think of a particular set of banks that were, 
were  affected because of their size and business model and things like that, that  were more 
affected by the turmoil in March than others , it’s very hard, as I mentioned;  it’s very hard to sort 
of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours from them tightening.  They may be 
tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks.  
The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year that banking conditions are 
tightening.  That process is ongoing, and that w ill restrain economic growth.  So I think —I think  
we have to take a step back from “ I can ’t separate those anymore.”   I think —I think , basically , 
we’re just looking at the overall picture , which is one of tightening credit conditions.  And that ’s, 
that’s  going to restrain economic activity .  It is restraining economic activity.  So that ’s how I 
would look at it.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  And how is that informing your outlook for setting 
policy?  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I think we —that goes —that ’s—an expected result of tightening 
interest rate policy is that—is th at bank credit conditions —bank lending conditions would 
tighten as well.  And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened 
in May?  I just don’ t think we know that.  I think we ’re looking at the current data in GDP , and 
we’re seeing strong spending.  We’ re seeing a strong economy, and it ’s made us confident that 
we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events.  And I —it 
seems like the economy is weathering this well, but , of course , we’re watching it carefully and, 
and expect to continue to do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Megan.  
MEGAN CAS SELLA.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Megan 
Cassella with Barron’ s.  I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any inflationary 
impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer 
sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we ’ve been seeing.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, [growth in nominal] wages in excess of inflation means [that 
increases in] real wages are positive.   Again, that ’s a great thing.  Of course , we want that .  We 
want people to have [gains in] real wages.  B ut we want wages to be going up at a level that ’s 
consistent with , with  2 percent inflation over time.  As I mentioned, [increases in] nominal wages 
have been coming down gradually, and that ’s what we want to see.  W e expect to see more of 
that.  That ’s just more of what’ s consistent o ver a longer period of time.  We don’ t really think 
that, that  wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak.  But I 
would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward.  Labor market conditions broadly a re going to be an important part of , of getting inflation back down, and that ’s why we 
think we need some further softening in labor market conditions. 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 28  
 MEGAN CAS SELLA.  This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you 
mentioned at the start how  you’ re keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might 
be some sort of a rebound there, and I ’m curious what the Fed ’s explanation would be to families 
if further interest rate hikes start to hit the labor market—start to , you know, drive that sentiment 
back down.  What ’s the message there of , of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise 
them?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get 
inflation under control.  And we think the , the single most important thing we can do to benefit 
those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get 
inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability.  We think that is the most 
important thing we  can do now , and we ’re determined to do that.  
And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away 
are people who are on a low fixed income, who, you know, when you’ re talking about travel or, 
you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those —if you’ re 
just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you’ re in trouble right 
away.  Even middle -class people have some resources and can absorb inflation .  People, people  
on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that.  So we need —we need  to 
get this done .  And, you know, the record is clear that if we —if we  take too long or if , if we 
don’t succeed , that the pain will only be greater.  So that ’s, that’s how I would explain what 
we’re doing.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVI TCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovi tch with t he 
Economist.  You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one.  In 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 28  
 the event , the market had assigned a, you know, a roughly 99  percent probability to the rate 
move that you announced today.  The decision was, of course , unanimous, and the  statement was 
basically unchanged from last month.  So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting 
actually a live one?  Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision was, was  actually going to be?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I mean , you could—“ Was there doubt? ”  Look, I would say 
there ’s a range of views on the Committee, and when you see the minutes in three weeks , you’ ll 
see that.  There ’s a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should 
do at the ne xt meeting, and it’s a—it’s a  process that we go through.  Many times when we go 
into a meeting, the decision is not , you know, fundamentally in doubt.  Nonetheless, we have the 
meeting , and some —some —some  meetings are , you know, less uncertain than others , and I ’ll 
just leave it at that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Evan.  
EVAN RYSER.   Evan Ryser, Market News International.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  
Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks —the dollar, the 
stock market, et cetera.  What does that mean for the Fed  and being sure that inflation will come 
down to target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we monitor , of course , financial conditions, broad financial 
conditions.  You’re right .  It’s the dollar and  equities, but —and, you know, we ’re, of course , 
very focused on rates and our own policy.  You know, we will —we ’re going to use our policy 
tools to —working through financial conditions —to get inflation under control  The implication 
is, you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down, and in principle, that , that  could 
mean that if financial conditions get looser, we have to do more.  But what tends to happen, 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 28  
 though, is , financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we ’re doing, and , and, 
ultimately , over time , we get where we need to go. 
EVAN RYSER.  If I could also ask about the S EP from June that showed rate cuts—d o 
you expect the Fed to cut nominal rates next year while also continuing QT?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that , that  could happen.  The question is, you know, is that 
consistent with , with —so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it ’s a world 
where things are okay , and it ’s time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more 
normal levels.  Normalization , in the case of , of the balance sheet , would be to reduce QT or to 
continue it , depending on where you are in the cycle.  So they are two independent t hings .  And, 
you know, really, the active tool of monetary policy is rates.  But you can imagine circumstances 
in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be just different 
ways.  But that wouldn’ t be the case.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Kyle.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Thanks , Chair Powell.  Kyle Campbell with American Banker.   I 
have a question about the discount window.  I ’m wondering if , since the bank failures of the 
spring, if you’ ve seen signs that  banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that 
they’ re ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether 
policies might be appropriate for making sure that banks sort of test regularly to , to show tha t 
they are prepared to use it .  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that ’s a very important thing .  Yes.  A nd yes to both sides of that .  
You know , yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window , 
and we are strongly encouraging them  to do that —banks broadly.  We did find, as you know, 
during the events of March and that , you know, that it ’s a little clunkier .  It can be a little 
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 28  
 clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes.  So why not be in a situation where , where  
you’re just much more ready in case you—in case you need to access the discount window ? 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Mark Hamrick. 
MARK HAMRICK.  Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  You ’ve talked in the 
past about getting the housing market back into better  balance —excuse me—and also that the 
market might have bottomed.  Where do you see that situation in  balance, or lack thereof, right 
now, particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might 
otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and, 
of course, also all of that happening with the 30 -year fixed -rate mortgage still around 7  percent 
on the heels of Fed  tightening and with what you’ re talking about tightening industry lending 
standards?   Are we getting closer to balance or farther away?  What ’s your sense?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think we ’ve got a ways to go to get back to balance , really , for the 
reasons that you talked about.  With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have 
low-rate mortgages, and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they ’re not going 
to because they have such, so much , value in their mortgage, whch means that supply of existing 
homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up.  
On the other hand, there ’s, you know, there ’s a lot of supply coming on line now , and, 
and there are people coming in .  A lot of the buyers  are, are, you know, first -time buyers coming 
in, buying at , you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates.  
But I think this will take some time to work through .  Hopefully, more supply comes on line , 
and, you know, we , we work through it.  We ’re still living through the , you know, the aftermath 
of the —of the  pandemic. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  We’ ll go to Nancy for the last question.  
July 26, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 28  
 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with 
Marketplace .  Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage 
through the Black Sea , and alternative routes at this point could be closed off.  Just wondering, 
how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally, a nd how closely are you 
watching that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We are watching it, of course, very closely.  And you’ re right .  The 
withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security, 
particularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food.  Grain prices did go up on this news , but they remain well below their peaks of last spring.  And the moves that we ’ve seen 
so far, I would say, are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation.  Of course , we will be watching that situation carefully.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  So you don’ t think it would have a big effect on Fed 
policy at this point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Doesn ’t.  You wouldn’ t say so looking at what we —what we  
know  now.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
September 20, 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone .  My colleagues and I remain squarely 
focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the 
American people.  We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain 
strongly committed to bringing inflation b ack down to our 2 percent goal .  Price stability is the 
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor m arket conditions that benefit all.  
Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary 
policy.  We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to 
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pac e.  We ’ve covered a lot of ground, and the full effects 
of our tightening have yet to be felt.  Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  Looking ahead, we ’re in a position 
to proceed carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate.  Our decisions will be based on our ongoing assessments of the incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.  I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace, and, 
so far this year, growth in real GDP has come in above expectations.  Recent readings on consumer spending have been particul arly robust.  Activity in the housing sector has picked up 
somewhat, though it remains well below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.  In our Summary of Economic Projections , or SEP, Committee participants revised up their assessments 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 
 
Page 2 of 28 
 of real GDP growth, with the median for this year now at 2.1  percent.  Participants expect growth 
to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.5 percent next year. 
The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into 
better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 150,000 jobs per month, a 
strong pace that is nevertheless well below that seen earlier in the yea r.  The unemployment rate 
ticked up in August but remains low at 3.8 percent.  The labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years.  Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined so far this year.  Although the 
jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.  
FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward 
pressures on inflation.  The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises from 
3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent over the next two years. 
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Based on the consumer 
price index, or CPI, and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 3. 4 percent over the 
12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.9 percent.  Inflation has moderated somewhat since the middle of last year, and longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad 
range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  Nevertheless, the progress—process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.3 percent this year, falls to 2.5 percent next year, and reaches 2 percent in 2026. 
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are g uided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 28  
 that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet th e higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We 
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we ’re 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
As I noted ea rlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage 
points.  We see the current stance of monetary policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure 
on economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  In addition, the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and businesses.  In light of how far we have come in tightening policy, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to conti nue the process of significantly reducing our 
securities holdings.  
We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is 
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time.  In our SEP, 
FOMC particip ants wrote down their individual assessments of an appropriate path for the 
federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely —sorry —the most 
likely  scenario going forward.  If the economy evolves as projected, the median parti cipant 
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.6 percent at the end of this 
year, 5.1 percent at the end of 2024, and 3.9 percent at the end of 2025.  Compared with our June Summary of Economic Projections , the median projec tion is unrevised for the end of this year 
but has moved up by ½ percentage point at the end of the next two years.  These projections , of 
course, are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve as projected, the path of  policy will ad just as appropriate to foster our maximum- employment and price -stability 
goals.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 28  
 incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflatio n, as well 
as the balance of risks.  
Given how far we have come, we are in a position to proceed carefully as we assess the 
incoming data and the evolving outlook and risks.  Real interest rates now are well above 
mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate, but we are mindful of the inherent uncertainties 
in precisely gauging the stance of policy.  We ’re prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, 
and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we ’re confident that inflation is moving 
down sustainably toward our objective.  In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary  policy 
affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.  
We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to 
keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is likely to require 
a period of below -trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions .  Restoring price 
stability  is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over 
the longer run. 
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby.  
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith wi th the Financial Times.   What makes the 
Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive, 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL 
 
Page 5 of 28 
 especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year?  
There ’s noted uncertainty about policy lags.  Headwinds have emerged from the looming 
government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt payments—things of that nature. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I would characterize the, the  situation a little bit 
differently.  So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is —at 
5¼ to 5½ percent —while continuing to reduce our securities holdings.  And we say we ’re 
committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive 
to bring down inflation to 2 percent  over time —we said that.  But the fact that we decided to 
maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn ’t mean that we ’ve decided that we have or have 
not at this time reached that —that  stance of monetary policy that we’re seeking.  If you looked  at 
the SEP, as you—as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that we will —that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates 
one more time in the two remaining meetings this year.  Others believe that we have already reached that.  So it ’s, it’s something where we ’re—by, by—we’re not making a decision by, by 
deciding to —about that quest ion by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data.  
COLBY SMITH.  So , right now, it’s still an open question about “ sufficiently 
restrictive ”—you’re not saying today that we’ ve reached this level?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’re not saying —yeah, no, no—c learly , we’re just —what we 
decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data.  We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we’re—we’ve —we ’ve seen progress, and, and  we welcome that.  But , you know, we need to see more 
progress before we’ ll be willing to —to reach that conclusion. 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 28  
 COLBY SMITH.  And just on the 2024 projections —what ’s behind that shallower path 
for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So I would say it this way:   First of all, interest rates —real 
interest rates are , are positive now.  They ’re meaningfully positive , and that ’s a good thing.  We 
need policy to be restrictive so that we can get i nflation down to target.  Okay.  And we need —
we’re going to need that to remain to be the case for some time.  So I think, you know —
remember that the —of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a 
plan.  It ’s a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians.  It ’s a cumulation of individual 
forecasts from 19 people, and then what you’ re seeing are the medians.  So I  wouldn’ t want to , 
you know, bestow upon it the idea that , that  it’s really a plan.  But what it reflects, though, is that 
economic activity’ s been stronger than we expected —stronger than I think everyone expected.  
And, and so what you’ re—what you’re  seeing is , this is what people believe, as of now, will be 
appropriate to achieve what we ’re looking to achieve, which is progress toward our —toward our  
inflation goal, as you see in the SEP.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Let ’s go to Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Ch air Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding 
steady?  Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing?  Could 
you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  So the proposal at the meeting was to —was to  maintain our 
current policy stance, and , and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that.  But this, 
of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think.  A nd you’ ve got —you 
have  some —you saw , I think —seven wrote down no hike  at this —at this  meeting —or between 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 28  
 now and t he end of the year .  And I think 12 wrote down another single hike  in one of the next 
two meetings that we have between the end of the year.   So it wasn ’t like we were arguing over 
that—people just stating their positions —and, really , what , what  people are  saying is , “Let’s see 
how the data come in. ”  You know, we , we want to see—you know what we want to see.  We 
want to see that , that this, this —these good inflation readings that we ’ve been seeing for the last 
three months —we want to see that it ’s more than just three months, right?  We want to see, you 
know —the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that  we received , was a good 
example of what  we do —of what we do want to see.  It was a combination of, of, you know, 
of—across a br oad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market.  So those are 
the two things —so those are our two mandate variables, and , and that ’s, that’s  the progress that 
we want to see.  But I think people —they want to be convinced, you know —they want to be 
careful to —not to jump to a conclusion, really , one way or the other —but just be convinced that 
the data, you know, support that conclusion.  And that ’s why, given how far we ’ve come and 
how quickly we ’ve come, we ’re actually in a position to b e able to proceed carefully as we 
assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting 
by meeting.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  I see.  And , in your view, what would— I know nothing has been 
decided yet —but what would one more hi ke at the end of the year do to the economy or to 
inflation?  And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out for us? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one 
way or the other won’ t matter .  But, for us, we ’re, we’re  trying—obviously, as a group, it ’s a 
pretty tight cluster of, of  where we think that , that  policy stance might be, but we ’re always 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 28  
 going to be learning from data.  You know, we ’ve learned all through the course of the la st year 
that, actually , we needed to go further than we had thought.  If you go back a year —and what we 
thought, what we wrote down—it’ s actually gotten higher and higher.  So we , we don’ t really 
know until —and that ’s why, again, we —we ’re in a position to proceed carefully at this point.  A 
year ago , we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up.  Now— now we’re fairly close, we think, 
to where we need to get.  It’ s, it’s just a question of reaching the right stance.  I wouldn’ t 
attribute huge importance to one hike in , in macroeconomic  terms.  Nonetheless, you know, we 
need —we need  to get to a place where  we’re confident that we have a stance that will bring 
inflation down to 2 percent  over time.  That ’s what we need to get to, and we ’ve been—you 
know, we’ve been  moving toward it.  As we ’ve gotten closer to it, we ’ve slowed the pace at 
which we ’ve moved.  I think that was appropriate.  And now that we ’re getting closer , we, we —
again, we have the ability to proceed carefully.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thanks.  Let ’s go to Steve. 
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Li esman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby ’s 
question here.  What is it saying about the C ommittee ’s view of the inflation dynamic in the 
economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a 
point of the funds rate on it?  Does it tell you that —does it tell us that the Committee believes 
inflation to be more persistent—requires more medicine , effectively?  And I guess a related 
question is , if you’ re going to proje ct a funds rate above the longer -run rate for four years in a 
row, at what point do we start to think, “ Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually 
higher ”?  Thank you. CHAIR POWELL.   So I , I guess I would point more to—rather than pointing to a sense 
of inflation having become more persistent , I wouldn’t think —that’s not —we’ve, we ’ve seen 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 28  
 inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn ’t say that ’s something 
that’s appeared in the recent data.  It’ s more about stronger economic activity, I would say.  So 
if, if I had to attribute one thing—again, we ’re, we’re  picking medians here and trying to 
attribute one explanation .  But I think , broadly, stronger economic activ ity means , means rates—
we have to do more with rates, and that ’s what —that’s what  that meaning is , is telling you.  In 
terms of , of what the neutral rate can be —you know, we —we  know it by its works.  We only 
know it by its works, really.  We can ’t—we can ’t—you know , the, t he models and, and—that we 
use, you—ultimately , you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts.  
And, again, that ’s another reason why we ’re—why we’re  moving carefully now , because, you 
know, there are lags here.  So it , it may —it may , of course, be that the —that the  neutral rate has 
risen.  You do see people —you don’ t see the median moving —but you do see people raising 
their estimates of , of the neutral rate, and it ’s certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher 
than, than the longer -run rate.  Remember —what we write down in the SEP is the longer -run 
rate.  It is certainly possible that, you know, that the —that the  neutral rate at this moment is 
higher than that , and that —that ’s part of the explanation for why the economy has been more 
resilient than , than expected.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thank you.  So you’ ve said 
several times that the economy needed a period of below -trend growth to get inflation 
consistently back to 2 percent.  You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit —1.5 percent  is just a 
touch below what ’s the estimate of potential.  So the fact that you ’re getting so much done at so 
much less cost , does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 28  
 you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction 
that’s necessary to achieve this?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, of course.  It is a —it is a  good thing that we, we ’ve seen now 
meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that ’s, 
that’s  because we’ re seeing that rebalancing in other places —in, for example, job openings and 
in the jobs –worker gap.  You ’re also seeing supply -side things —so, so that ’s happening.  I would 
say, though, we still —I still think, and I think , broadly, people still think, that there will have to 
be some softening in the labor market  that can come through more supply, as we ’ve seen as well.  
Also, remember, the natural rate , we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply- side thing, so 
that the , the gap between any given unemployment rate that ’s lower than that and the natural rate 
comes down .  That’s a way for supply—that ’s a way for  the labor market to achieve a better 
balance.  So all of those things are happening.  You ’re right —in, in the median forecast, we 
don’t see a big increase in unemployment.  We do see an increase, and— but that’s —that really is 
just “ playing forward ” the trends that we ’ve been seeing.   That is not guaranteed.  There , there  
may come a time when unemployment goes up more  than that, but that ’s, that’s  really what 
we’ve been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So ju st to, to boil that down for a second—you know, we ’ve 
gone from a very narrow path to a —to a soft landing to something different.  Would you call the 
soft landing now a baseline expectation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, no—I would not do that.  I , I would just say—w hat, what  would 
I say about that?  I ’ve always thought that the soft landing was , was  a plausible outcome—that 
there was a path, really, to , to a soft landing.  I’ve thought that , and I ’ve said that since we lifted 
off.  It ’s also possible that , that  the path ha s narrowed, and it ’s widened , apparently.  Ultimately, 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 28  
 it—this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day.  But I do 
think it ’s—I do think it ’s possible.  And, you know —I also think, you know, this is why we ’re in 
a position to , to move carefully again.  That —we, we will restore price stability.  We, we  know 
that we have to do that , and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we 
have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is 
an extended period—sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  We know that.  The fact that we’ ve come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying.  
So I think, you know, that ’s, that’s  the end we ’re trying to achieve.  I wouldn’ t want to handicap 
the likelihood of it, though.  It’ s not up to me to do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos , the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, both you and 
Vice Chair Williams have indicated that “ sufficiently restrictive ” will be judged on a real rather 
than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year —provided further 
compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside.  Is the FOMC focused on 
targeting a real level of policy restriction?  And can you explain what would constitute enough 
evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings  sufficiently restrictive?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I mean, yes —we , we understand that it ’s a real rate that will matter 
and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive.  And, again, I would say, you know —you know  
“sufficiently restrictive ” only when you see it.  You —it’s not something you can arrive at with 
confidence in a model or , or in various estimates, you know.  And so what are we seeing?  
We’re, w e’re seeing, you know, through a combination of the , you know, the  unwinding of the 
pandemic -related demand and supply distortions and monetary polic y’s work in suppressing 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 28  
 demand or , or, you know, alleviating very high demand—t he combination of those two things is 
actually working.  You ’re seeing, you know, inflation coming down.  It’ s principally now in 
goods —also in housing services.  You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well.  
So I think— we think that that is working.  And I , I think, you know —as we’ ve said, we , we want 
to reach that —we want to reach something that we’ re confident gets us to that level.  And I think 
confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, “Yes, okay, this feels 
like it—we can —we can,  for now , decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here. ”  
We’re not per manently deciding not to go higher, but , but we would—let ’s say , if we get to that 
level —and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level?  And that ’s a whole other set 
of questions.  For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there.  
And we haven’ t—we haven’t  gotten to a point of confidence about that yet.  That ’s, that’s  what 
we’re —that’s, that’s the stage we’ re at, though.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  But it looks like  there was— because there was an across- the-board 
drop in the core PCE projection—core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent .  
Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you —than you 
currently anticipate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The decision that we make  at, you know, at each meeting and, 
certainly , at the —at the  last two meetings this year —it’s going to depend on the totality of all the 
data:  so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the , the balance of risks, and 
the other events that are happening out there.  We’ll make —we take all of that into account, so I 
can’t really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that.  It’ll— it’ll be trying to reach a 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 28  
 judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that 
would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move , and it will help , help 
us be more confident that we ’ve gotten to the level that we need to get to.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Following up on Nick’ s question, 
actually —John Will iams, the New York F ed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of , 
“Next year , as we see inflation kind of ”—again, to Nick’ s point —“as, as we see inflation coming 
down, we ’re going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we ’re not squeezing the 
economy harder and harder over time.”   And I wonder if that ’s basically the logic that you 
apply—you know, i s that how you think about it?  And then I also wonder —in the la st press 
conference, you said something to the effect of , you know, “I t’s a full year out —those 
discussions, ” and people interpreted that to mean that you didn’ t see a possibility of a rate cut in 
the first half of next year.  And I wonder if that was what  you meant by that or whether, you 
know —how you’ re thinking about that timing.  
CHAIR POWELL.   No.  When —so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals 
about , about  cutting, I ’m never intending to send a signal about timing ; I’m just answering them 
as, as the question is expressed.  So , so please— I, I wouldn’ t want to be taken that way.  Sorry —
the first question was, is that how?  Yeah, so we’re —as we go into next year, th at’s the question 
we’ll be asking is —you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about 
the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the , the time will come at some 
point, and I ’m not saying when, that it ’s—that it’s  appropriate to cut.  Part of that may be that 
real rates are rising because infl ation is coming down.  Part of it just may be that— it’ll be all the 
factors that we see in the economy.  And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point.  
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 28  
 And you—what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that 
might be.  And, you know, there ’s—you know , there’s  so much uncertainty around that.  In, in—
when we —in the moment, we ’ll do what we think makes sense.  No one will look back at this 
and say, “H ey, we made a plan.”   It’s not like that at all.  It’s—this is —these are estimates made 
a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that ’s how it is.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks so much, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  I wonder —how 
do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we ’ve been seeing is driven 
by excess demand versus supply- side factors, productivity, labor force growth?  And , relatedly, 
if GDP keeps coming in “hot,”  even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own 
be a reason to consider more  tightening?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So on, on your first question —I mean, we ’re looking at GDP very, 
very carefully to try to understand really what ’s the direction of it—what ’s, what’s  driving it.  
And it ’s, it’s a lot of consumer spending, you know.  It’s been —the consumer ’s been very robust 
in its —in spending.  So that is, you know, that ’s how we ’re looking at it.   Sorry, your second 
question was — 
NEIL IRWIN.  Does GDP stay s “hot,” but without inflation ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I , I think the question will be —GDP is not our  mandate, right?  
Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates.  The question will be, is , is the 
level —is GDP —is the —is the heat that we see in GDP —is it really a threat to our ability to get 
back to 2 percent  inflation?  That ’s going to be the question.  It’s not —it’s not  a question about 
GDP on its own.  It’ s, you —you know, you’ re expecting to see the —this improvement, you 
know —continued rebalancing in the labor market and infl ation moving back down to 2 percent  
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 28  
 in a sustainable way.   We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we ’d be—we’d be  
looking at GDP just , just  to the extent that it threatens one or both of those.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guido with Politico.  There are multiple external 
factors that are playing out right now.  We see rising oil prices.  We see auto workers striking.  
There ’s the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown.  And I was just wondering, 
for each of those things, could you talk about how you’ re thinking about how that might affect 
the course for the F ed and the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So there is a—there is a long list, and you hit some of them.  But  it—
you know, it ’s, it’s the strike, it’ s government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, 
higher long- term rates, oil price shock.  You know, you could—there are a lot of things that you 
can—you can look at.  And, you know —so , what we try to do is assess all of them and , and  
handicap all of them.  And , ultimately, though, there ’s so much uncertainty around, around these 
things.  I mean, to , to start with the strike —first of all, we absolutely don ’t comment on the 
strike , as we have no view on the strike one way or the ot her.  But we , we do have to make an 
assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs.  So, you know, the , the thing about it is —so 
uncertain.  It will depend.  The e conomic effects —it could affect —you’ve looked— we’ve 
looked back at history— it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation.  But that ’s really 
going to depend on how broad it is and how long it ’s sustained for.  And we —and then it also 
depends on how quickly production can make up for , for lost production.  So none of those 
things are known right now.  It’ s very, very hard to know.  So you just have to leave that 
uncertain.  And, and we ’ll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period , 
much more about that.  And the same is true for the others.  We, we—I don’ t know if you 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 28  
 mentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list.  We don’ t comment on that.  It 
hasn’t traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect.  
You know, energy prices being higher —that’s —that is a significant thing.  We—e nergy 
prices b eing up can affect spending.  It can affect the consumer  over time.  A sustained period of 
higher —of higher  energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation.  We tend to 
look through short -term volatility and look at —look at  core inflation.  But  so the question is , 
how long are , are higher prices sustained ?  We have to —we have to  take those macroeconomic 
effects into account as well.  Those are —those are  some of them.  I’m not sure if I hit them all.  
But—I mean, ultimately, you know, you’ re, you’re  coming into this with an economy that 
appears to have significant momentum.  And that ’s, that’s  what we start with.  And we —but we 
do have this collection of risks that you mentioned. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Craig.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloombe rg News.  I was a little surprised, Chair 
Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective.  This economy’ s seeing 
added supply in a way that could create long- term inflation stability.  We have prime -age labor 
force participation mov ing up where people can add skills.  Workers want to work.  We have a 
boom in manufacturing construction.  We’ ve had a decent spate of homebuilding.  And since 
inflation ’s coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity.  All are 
which —good for the Fed’ s longer -run target of low inflation.  And if we lose that in a recession, 
aren’t we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010?  So are you taking this into 
account as you pursue policy?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  To begin:  A  soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say 
otherwise.  I mean, that ’s, that’s  what we ’ve been trying to achieve for all this time.  
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 28  
 The, the real point, though, is —the , the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price 
stability , because the record is clear on that :  If you , you don’ t restore price stability, inflation 
comes back, and you go through—you  can have a long period where the economy’ s just very 
uncertain , and it will affect growth ; it will affect all kinds of things.   It can be a miserable period 
to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and 
again.  So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to rest ore price stability.  I think 
now, today, we actually —you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move 
carefully, and that ’s what we ’re planning to do.  So we fully appreciate  that—you know, the 
benefits of being able to continue what  we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market 
and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important , large increase in 
unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles.  So — 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Chris.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.   Hi.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.  
When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of 
what some economists are calling “ the low -hanging fruit ”—such as the unwinding of supply 
chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions —or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that 
involves most goods and services across the economy?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So if I—i f I understood your question, it’s—I would say it this way :  
I thin k we knew from the time —from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we 
lift—we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response.   So that unwinding was going to be important.  In addition, monetary policy was going 
to help.  It was going to help supply side heal by, by  cooling demand off and, just in general, 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 28  
 better aligning supply with demand.  So those tw o forces were always going to be important.  I 
think it ’s very hard to pull them apart.  They work together.  I , I do think both of them are at 
work now, and I think they’ re at work in a way that shows you the progress that we —that we  are 
seeing.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Mike.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  In June, 
you forecast a 5.6 percent  year -end median fed funds rate, and since then , you’ve more than 
doubled your growth forecast.  You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly.   So, what 
would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation?  And given all 
the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or the American people have in your fo recasts?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, forecasts are highly uncertain.   Forecasting is very difficult.  
Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.  But to get to, to your question, 
though—what ’s happened is , growth has come in stronger, right ?  Stronger than expected—and 
that’s required higher rates.  Unemployment, you know —you also see that the , the ultimate 
unemployment rate is not as high, but that —that ’s really because of what we’ ve been seeing in 
the lab or market.  We ’ve seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing 
significantly higher unemployment.  So we’re, we ’re continuing that trend.  In terms of inflation, 
you, you are seeing— the last three readings are , are very good readings.  It’s only three readings, 
you know.  We—we ’re well aware that we need to see more than three readings.   But if you look 
at June, July, and August, you’ re looking at, you know, really significant declines in core 
inflation, largely in the goods sector —also to  some extent in housing services and just a little in 
nonhousing services.  Those are the three buckets.  Headline inflation, of course, has come way 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 28  
 down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing.  So I think —people 
should know t hat, that  economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain 
forecasts.  But these are —these are our forecasts.  You know, they’re, they’re —we have very 
high- quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other 
forecasters.  But just the nature of the business is , the economy is very difficult to forecast.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.   Given the —given the  forecast that you  have, what justified not 
moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming 
down?  In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I , I think we have come very far very fast in , in the , the rate 
increases that we’ ve made.  And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly, 
and we did.  And , and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think —the stance of monetary 
policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation dow n to 2  percent  over time, you know, the 
risks become more two  sided , and the risk of overtightening and the risk of , of undertightening 
becomes more equal.   And I think the , the natural, commonsense thing to do is , as you approach 
that, you move a little m ore slowly as you get closer to it.  And that, that’s what we ’re doing.  So 
we’re, we ’re taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more 
carefully now as we—as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need 
to get inflation back down to 2 percent . 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  With your focus on year -over-year PCE, isn ’t it true that base effects are huge 
and that by the time you meet in November , that it’ s more likely that you ’ll have a low PCE 
number that would make you feel more comfortable?  And , secondly, how would the lack of key 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 28  
 indicators —like CPI, the jobs report —impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to 
have a government shutdown?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry —yeah, I  missed the first question.  What was —missed what 
factors?  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  The base factors.  
CHAIR POWELL.   Base factors.  Ah.  Okay.  So on that , we’re, you know, we ’re 
looking at just monthly , right ?  You can look at just monthly readings  and see what the increase 
was from the prior month.  So you’ re right—when  you go back  3, 6, and 12 months, you get base 
factors.   But we can —we can  adjust for that.  In terms of not getting data —you know , again, we 
don’t—we don’t  comment on government shutdowns.  It—i t’s possible —if, if there is a 
government shutdown and it lasts through the , the next meeting, then it ’s possible we wouldn’ t—
we wouldn’t  be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get , and we —you know, we  
would just have to deal with that.  And I don’ t know.  It’ s hard for me to say in advance how that 
would affect that meeting.   It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don’ t know about now.  
But it’ s certainly a reality that , that  that’s a possibility.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects 
that—as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November, 
would you feel more comfortable at that point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, yes.  I mean, if you ’re looking —if—we, we can tell how 
much inflation has gone up in a given month, right?  And, you know, that ’s what we ’re looking 
at.  And month by month, what ’s the reading?  And, you know, I think —I think what we ’re 
really looking at is , there ’s a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but 
they’ re incredibly volatile , and they can be misleading.  That ’s why we look at 12- month [rates] .  
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 28  
 But I think , in this situation —where it looks like we ’ve had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in 
June—we ’re also looking at six months , and even three months, but really six months ’ inflation.  
So you’ re looking at it over that period and over longer periods.  T hat—that’s the right way to 
go.  And we don’ t—we don’t  need to be in a hurry to —in, in getting to a conclusion about what 
to do.  We can let the data evolve.   So— 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward . 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks for the question, Chair Powell.  Edward Lawrence 
with Fox Business.  So I want to focus back in on oil prices.  We’re seeing oil prices, as you 
mentioned, move up, and that ’s pushing the price of gas.  So how does that factor into your 
decision to raise rates or not —because i n the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we ’ve 
seen, the overall inflation has actually risen ? 
CHAIR POWELL .  Right.  So, you know, energy prices are very important for the 
consumer.  This, this  can affect consumer spending.  It certainly can affect consumer sentiment.  
I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that , that  affects consumer sentiment.  It , it really 
comes down to how persistent —how sustained these energy prices are.  The reason why we look 
at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that.  
And it doesn’t—energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don’ t contain much of a signal about how 
tight the economy is, and hence don ’t tell you much about where inflation’ s really going.  
However, we ’re well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high, 
that’ll have an effect on spending.  And , and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations 
of infl ation —things like that.   That ’s just things we have to monitor.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  On the consumer —they’re putting more and more of this on 
their credit card.  The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending.  How long do you 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 28  
 think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now?  And are you concerned 
about a , a debt bubble related to that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that ’s why we tend to 
look through energy moves that we —tha t we can see as, as  short -term volatility.  You know, 
turning to consumer credit,  you know —of course , we watch that carefully.  Consumer distress—
measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after—during and after the , the pandemic.  They ’re now moving back up to normal.  We’ re, we’re  
watching that carefully.  But, at this point, these , these  readings are not at troublingly high levels.  
They ’re, they’re  just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre -pandemic 
era. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean.  
JEAN YUNG.   Hi.  Jean Yung with M NI Market News.   Yields along the Treasury curve 
have risen to their highest in years.  What is the Fed ’s view about what ’s been driving that 
increase in recent weeks,  and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations —and how 
much to technical factors?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So you’ re right.  You know, rates have moved up significantly.  I 
think it ’s always hard to say precisely, but it’s —most , most  people do a common decomposition 
of the increase, and the y’ll, they’ll—the  view will be , it’s not —it’ s not mostly about inflation 
expectations.  It’ s mostly about other things, you know —either term premium or real yields —
and it ’s, it’s hard to be precise about this.  Of cour se, everyone ’s got models that ’ll give you a 
very precise answer, but they give you different answers.  So —but , essentially, they ’re, they’re  
moving up because— it’s not because of inflation.  It’ s because probably —it’ll  probably have 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 28  
 something to do with s tronger growth, I would say—more , more  supply of Treasuries.  You 
know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Kyle.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Kyle Campbell, American Banker.   Thank you for taking the 
questions —just two on, on housing.  You ’ve said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline 
and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there’ s also some questions out 
there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which 
are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental 
market.  So my question is , how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it ’s measured and 
felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply?  And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock- in effect of mortgages being higher now 
than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about 
taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So on the supply point —of course, supply is very important over 
time in , in setting house prices and, and , for that matter, rents.  And so—and supply is kind of 
structurally constrained.  But in terms of, of  where inflation ’s going in the near term, though, as , 
as you obviously know, a lot of it is , is leases that are running off and then being re -signed or re -
leased at a level that ’s, that’s  not as —it won ’t be that much higher.  A ye ar ago, it would have 
been much higher than it was a year before ; now it may be below or at the same level.  So as 
those leases are rolling over, we’ re, we’re  seeing what we expect, which is measured housing 
services inflation coming down.  Your second question was the lock- ins.  How much is that 
affecting things, really?  
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 28  
 KYLE CAMPBELL.   Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates 
down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a 
lock- in that sort of stagnates the housing market?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I, I think we look at the —I would look at the lock- in, the , the idea 
being that people are in, in v ery low mortgage —very low -rate mortgages, and if—even if they 
want to move now, they—it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive.  And that ’s explaining some of the —that’s one of the explanations for what ’s happening broadly 
in the labor market.  Would that play a role in , in our future decisions —in a —in a future tight—
in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates?  No, I , I don’t think it would.  I 
mean, I  don’t think that’s —I, I think we ’d be looking at , what , you know, fundamentally, what , 
what  rates does the economy need?  And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic 
or during the Global F inancial C risis, you, you know, the, the —you have to cut rates to the point 
that—you have to do, do  what you can to support the economy.  So I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’t  think 
that that would be a reason for us not to do that.  It ’s not something we ’re thinking about at all 
right now.  But , down the road, I wouldn’ t think so. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy. NANCY MARS HALL -GENZER.   Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, you’ ve mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence, 
maybe cut back consumer spending —possible government shutdown, high gas prices.  At this 
point, woul d the F ed welcome a decrease in consumer spending?  Would that help you get 
inflation closer to your 2  percent  target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I , I wouldn’ t say it that way.  We’ re not looking for a decrease in 
consumer spending.  It’s, it’s a good thing that the e conomy’ s strong.  It’s a good thing that the 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 28  
 economy has been able to hold up under , under  the tightening that we ’ve done.  It’ s a good thing 
that the labor market ’s strong.  The , the only concern—it , it just means this :  If the economy 
comes in stronger than expected, that just means we ’ll have to do more in terms of monetary 
policy to get back to 2 percent —because we will get back to 2  percent .  Does that answer your 
question?  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Yeah .  And I guess , on the other hand, would you 
worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Well, that ’s always a concern.  I mean, concern number one is , is 
restoring price stability , because in the long run, that’s, that’s  something we have to do so that 
we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight 
labor market conditions that benefit all, as  I—as I ’ve said a couple times.  So that , that  said—of 
course,  you know —we,  we also now, given how far we ’ve come with our rate hikes and how 
quickly we ’ve come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of 
that co nsideration.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVI TCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovi tch with t he 
Economist.  One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of 
rate sensitivity than in the past.  Obviously, we ’ve talked about households with long fixed- rate 
mortga ges—also companies that refinanced before last year.  What is your thinking about the 
efficacy of rates and how that ’s changed?  And then, related to that, how do you think about the 
distributional consequences in the sense that if you’ re a relatively weal thy household with a long 
fixed -rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 28  
 you’re relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a 
lot tougher a lot more quickly?  Thank s. 
CHAIR POWELL.   So, what —I guess it ’s fair— it’s fair to say that the economy has 
been stronger than many expected, given, given what ’s been happening with, with  interest rates.  
Why is that?  Many candidate explanations—possibly—a number of them make sen se.  One , one  
is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had 
understood, and so that , that  spending has held up —and that kind of thing.  We’ re not sure about 
that.  The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot.  The question is whether that ’s 
sustainable.  That could —it could just mean that the —that the  date of effect is, is  later.  It could 
also be that for other reasons , the neutral rate of interest is , is higher for —for  various reasons.  
We don’ t know that.  It could also just be that policy hasn’ t been restrictive enough for long 
enough.  And it’s —there are many candidate explanations.  We have to, in , in all this 
uncertainty, make policy, and I , you know, I  feel like what we have right now is what’ s still a 
very strong labor market —but that ’s coming back into balance.  We were making progress on 
inflation.  Growth is strong.  But I think by many forecasts —many, many, many forecasts call 
for growth to, to mode rate over the course of the next year.  So that ’s where we are, and , you 
know, we have to —we have to  deal with what comes.   On your second question, which was —
sorry, your second question was  distributional, but can you—can you be a little clearer 
about  that? 
SIMON RABINOVI TCH.  Yeah .  My point there was that if you ’re somebody who has a 
long fixed- rate mortgage, you’ ve been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily.   If you’ re 
somebody who’ s living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are  
punitive.  
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 28  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Yes .  And so the point I would make there is that we ’re trying to get 
inflation back down.  The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a 
fixed income.  If you’ re a person wh o spends all of your income, you don ’t really have any 
meaningful savings.  You spend all your income on the basics of life —clothing, food, 
transportation, heating —the basics— and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent , you’ re in trouble right 
away, whereas even , even  middle -class people have some savings and some ability to absorb 
that.  So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and, 
and we , we want to do it as quickly as possible.  Obviously, we —we ’d like to do that .  We’ d like 
the current trend to continue, which is that we ’re making progress without seeing the kind of 
increase in unemployment that we ’ve seen past —in past things.  But you’ re right, though.  When 
we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on cr edit cards and , and borrowing are going to 
feel that more.  They are.  And, of course, people with, with  lots of savings also have a —have a  
much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they’re not going to —it’ s not going to affect 
them as much. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Greg Robb for the last question.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  In the Beige 
Book recently, you can tell that the F ed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups 
about the economic hea lth of low -income Americans—moderate -income Americans.  I have two 
questions about this.  Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a 
quarterly survey of those groups —like the senior loan officer survey?  And from your —and also 
the second question is , from your recent look— readings of these surveys, how are low and 
moderate  Americans doing?  Is there this thing where, like, the  GDP is strong because of wealthy 
September 20, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 28 of 28  
 Americans kind of driving things?   I just want to get your sense of the he alth of that sector.  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.   So I , I don’ t know  about the quarterly survey.  That ’s an idea we 
can—we can  take away and think about.  In terms of how low and moderate  Americans —you 
know, they’re  clearly —were suffering from, from high inflation.  I think during the pandemic, 
the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful.  And, you know, if you know 
the—the  surveys that we take showed that —showed that  low- and moderate -income people were 
actually in very, very st rong financial condition.  I think now it ’s a very “ hot” labor market, and 
you’re seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you’ re starting to see [ that growth rates of] 
real wages are now positive by most —by most  measures.   So I , I think , overall , households are 
in good shape. 
Surveys are a different thing.  So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of 
that is just, people hate inflation —hate it.  And that , that  causes people to say , “The economy’ s 
terrible .”  But, at the same time , they’re spending money.  Their behavior is , is not exactly what 
you would expect from the surveys.  That’s kind of a , a guess at what the answer might be.  But 
I, I think there ’s a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets —and, certainly , in 
the labor market and with wages.  The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low -
wage jobs —and now [with] inflation coming down—you’ re seeing [increases in] real wages, 
which  is a good thing.  
Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
November 1 , 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone .  Welcome.  My colleagues and I remain 
squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for 
the American people.  We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing, and we remain strongly committed to bringing inflation b ack down to our 2 percent goal.  Price stability is the 
responsibility of the Federal Reserve.  Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.  In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor m arket conditions that benefit all.  
Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary 
policy.  We have raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.  The stance of policy is restrictive—meaning that 
tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation—a nd the full 
effects of our tightening have yet to be felt.  Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate 
unchanged and to continue to reduce our securi ties holdings.  Given how far we have come, 
along with the uncertainties and risks we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.  We will 
make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on th e totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of 
risks.  I ’ll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic 
developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a strong pace and 
well above earlier expectations.  In the third quarter, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an outsized annual rate of 4.9 percent, boosted by a surge in consumer s pending.  After picking up 
somewhat over the summer, activity in the housing sector has flattened out and remains well 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 27 
 below levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates also 
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.  
The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into 
better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 266,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.  The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8  percent.  Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the 
supply of workers.  T he labor force participation rate has moved up since late last year, 
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years, and immigration has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.  Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, and job vacancies have declined 
so far this year.  Although the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, l abor demand still exceeds the 
supply of available workers.  
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  Total PCE prices rose 
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September.  Excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 3.7 percent.  Inflation has moderated since t he middle of last 
year, and readings over the summer were quite favorable.  But a few months of good data are 
only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.  The process of getting inflation sustainably down to 2 percent has a long way to go.  Despite elevated inflation, longer- term inflation expectations appear to remain 
well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecast ters, as well as measures from financial markets.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 27  
 those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We 
are highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 perc ent objective.  
As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage 
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.  Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.  The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the  target range for the federal funds rate at 
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  We are committed to achieving a sta nce of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring 
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective.  
We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand 
for labor.  Evidence of growth persistently above potential, or that tightness in the labor market is 
no longer easing, could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further 
tightening of monetary policy.  
Financial conditions have tightened significantly in recent months, driven by higher 
longer -term bond yields, among other factors.  Because persistent changes in financial conditions 
can have implications for the path of monetary policy, we monitor financi al developments 
closely.  
In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is 
proceeding carefully.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks.  In determining the extent of additional policy firming 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 27  
 that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into 
account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.  
We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to 
keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Reducing inflation is likely to require 
a period of below -potential growth and some softening of labor market condit ions.  Restoring 
price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  Thank you, Chair Powell, 
for doing this.  To what —you referenced the rise in long- term bond yields —to what degree did 
that supplant  action  by the F ed at this meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks for your question.  So, I ’ll talk about bond yields, but I want 
to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we ’re looking at that.  So, if 
you—if you look at the situation —let’ s look at the economy first .  Inflation has been coming 
down, but it ’s still running well above our 2 percent target.  The labor market has been 
rebalancing , but it ’s still very tight by many measures.  GDP growth has been strong, although 
many forecasters are forecasting , and they have bee n forecasting, that it will slow.  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 5 of 27  
 As for the C ommittee, we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that ’s 
sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time , and we ’re not confident yet 
that we have achieved such a stance.  So that is the broader context into which this , this  strong 
economy and all the things I said —that’s the context in which we ’re looking at this question of 
rates.  
So, obviously we ’re monitoring , we’re attentive to the increase in longer -term yields 
and—which have contributed to a tightening of broader financial conditions since the summer.  
As I mentioned, persistent changes in broader financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy.  In this case , the tighter financial conditions we ’re seeing —[coming] 
from higher long -term rates , but also from other sources , like the stronger dollar and lower 
equity prices —could matter for future rate decisions, as long as two conditions are satisfied.  
The first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent .  And that is something 
that remains to be seen.   But that ’s critical .  Things are fluctuating back and forth— that’s not 
what we ’re looking for.  With financial conditions, we ’re looking for persistent changes that are 
material.  
The second thing is that , that  the longer -term rates that have moved up—they can ’t 
simply be a reflection of , of expected policy moves from us that we would then— that if we 
didn’ t follow through on them, then the rates would come back down.  So, and I would say on 
that, it does not appear that an expectation of higher near -term policy rates is causing the 
increase in longer -term rates.   So, in the meantime , though, perhaps the most important thing is 
that these higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing cost s for households 
and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and the mind ’s eye goes to the 8 percent —near 8 percent mortgage rate, 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 27  
 which could have pretty significant effect on housing.  So that ’s how I would answer your 
question.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Just as a quick follow -on, to be clear on this :  In your opening 
statement just now, you seemed to imply that you are not yet confident that financial conditions 
are restrictive enough to finish the fight.   Is that true?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes .  That’s exactly right.  You know, t o say it a different way :  We 
haven’ t made any decisions about , about  future meetings.  We have not made a determination , 
and we ’re not —I will say that we ’re not confident at this time that we ’ve reached such a stance.  
We’re not confident that we haven’ t; we’re not confident that we have.  And that ’s—that is —the 
way we ’re going to be going into these future meetings is to be , you know, just determining the 
extent of any additional further policy tighte ning that may be appropriate to return inflation to 
2 percent over time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean na. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  T hank you so much for taking our questions.  I 
wonder , you know, if you don’ t raise interest rates in December, would the presumption be at 
that point that we should expect that rates are at their peak, or is there a possibility of restarting 
rate increases next year?  And are there any costs to taking a more extended pause?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, let me start by saying we haven’ t made a decision about 
September .  You’re asking a hypothetical there .  But we ’re going into December meeting —we ’ll 
get, as you know, two more inflation ratings, two more labor market readings, some data on, on 
economic activity, and so we ’ll be taking —and also the broader situation , the broader financial 
condition situation and broader world situation.  W e’ll be looking at all those things as we make 
a decision in December.  We haven ’t made that decision.  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 27  
 I would say,  though, that , that  the idea that if you —the idea that would— difficult to raise 
again after stopping for a meeting or two , it’s just not right.  I mean , the C ommittee will always 
do what it thinks is appropriate at the time.  And , again, we haven’ t made any decisions  about —
at all about December.  We didn’ t even —we didn’ t talk about making a decision in December 
today.  R eally , it was a decision for this meeting and understanding broader things . 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, did the F ed 
staff put a recession back into the baseline forecast in the materials for today ’s meeting?   And 
how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening 
is persistent ?  You had said it was worth maybe a ¼ point when we had the bank failures in the 
spring.  What is it here on something that ’s presumably more straightforward and more familiar 
to simulate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I don’ t want to answer your question about the—about the 
recession .  But the answer is “ no.”  I think I have to answer it, since we did publicly say in the 
minutes —you’ll know anyway in the [next] minutes —the staff did not put a recession back in.  I 
mean , it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the —look at the  activity 
we’ve seen recently, which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term.   
In terms of how to think about translation into rate hikes, I think it ’s just too early to be 
doing that, and the main reason is we just don’ t know how persistent this will be.  You can see 
how volatile it is .  Different kinds of news will affect the level of rates , and I think any kind of an 
estimate that was precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly.  So I think what we can say is that financial conditions have clearly tightened, and you 
can see that in the rates t hat, that  consumers and households and businesses are paying now .  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 27  
 And over time , that will have an effect .  We just don’ t know how persistent it ’s going to be , and 
it’s tough to try to translate that in a way that I ’d be comfortable communicating in to how many 
rate hikes that is.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  I ’d like to follow  up and ask what makes you confident —what 
makes you confident in the tighter financial conditions will slow above -trend growth when 
500 basis points of rate hikes, QT, and a minor banking crisis have not thus far?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I just— that’s, you know, the way our policy works is —and 
sometimes it works with lags , of course, which can be long and variable, but ultimately , if you 
raise interest rates, you do see those effects .  And you see those effects in the economy now .  
You see what ’s happening in the housing market .  You’re seeing that now .  You’ll see, if you 
look at surveys of people, it ’s not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds 
because rates are so high now.   I mention again, we ’re getting reports from housing that the 
effects of this —of this could be quite significant.  But you’ re right.  This has been a resilient 
economy.  A nd it’s, I think , been surprising in its resilience.  A nd there are a number of possible 
reasons why that may be.  Our job is to—is to achieve maximum employment and price stability , 
and so we take the economy as it comes.  It has been resilient, so we just —we take it as it is.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Colby. 
COLBY SMTH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with t he Financial Times.  In terms of the 
thresholds that you’ ve laid out of what could warrant further tightening, the additional evidence 
of persistently above -trend growth, or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of labor market 
tightness —that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more ¼ point rate hike 
would be necessary.   And I ’m just curious if that’ s how the C ommittee sees it.  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’ve identified those factors .  Those were not meant to be the 
only factors or a specific test that we ’re going to be applying with some metrics behind it.  
Really , we’re going to be looking at the broader picture .  You know, what ’s happening with our 
progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal ?  Is the labor market continuing to , broadly, cool off 
and achieve a better balance?  W e’ll be looking at that.  You know, growth —we look at growth 
insofar as it has implications for our two manda te goals .  We look at that, and we look at broader 
financial conditions.  So we ’ll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment, you 
know, whether we need to further tighten policy.  A nd, if we do reach that judgment, then we 
will further tighten policy.  
COLBY SMITH.  Okay .  And just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions, if 
that is having some kind of offsetting e ffect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates, 
what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of rate cuts?  Could we see those maybe pulled 
forward or have to see more than what the September SEP indicated?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it ’s, it’s—the fact is the C ommittee is not thinking about rate cuts 
right now at all.  We ’re not talking about rate cuts .  We’re still very focused on the first question, 
which is , have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that ’s sufficiently restrictive to bring 
inflation down to 2 percent over time sustainably?  That is the question we ’re focusing on.  The 
next question, as you know, will be , for how long will we remain restrictive?  Will policy remain 
restrictive ?  And what we ’ve sa id there is that we ’ll keep policy restrictive until we ’re confident 
that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2 percent.  That ’ll be the next question, but 
honestly, right now we ’re really tightly focused on the first question.  The question of rate cuts 
just doesn ’t come up because I think the first —it’s so important to get that first question , you 
know, as close to right as you can.  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 27  
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, I guess I had assumed that 
there was a tightening bias in the C ommittee .  You say in the statement you ’re looking to assess 
the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the extent to which you may need to hike additionally.  You didn’ t say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive .  There were forecasts for two rate 
hikes among most members of the C ommittee .  But then you just said that , you know, we 
don’t—we haven ’t made a determination.  Would you say the bias right now is neutral, that there 
is no disposition to hike again and that the C ommittee largely has moved off of this forecast for 
two hikes?  Sorry, one additional — 
CHAIR POWELL.  No .  I wouldn’ t say that at all.  I would say—I mean , the language , 
looking at it here, “I n determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate 
to return inflation to 2 percent over time. ”  That ’s the question we ’re asking.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  So is it right to think of that as a hiking bias is still in the C ommittee 
here?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We haven ’t used that term, but it ’s fair to say that ’s the question 
we’re asking is, should we hike more ?  It’s not —it’s not, you know —that is the question, and 
you’re right that, in September , we wrote down one additional rate hike.  But, you know —and 
we’ll [each] write down another forecast, as you know, in December.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Thank you, Chris Rugaber, at Associated Press.  Well, since the last 
meeting, the auto workers ’ strike has finished, oil prices have leveled off, and yet , on the other 
hand, you have the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.  How do you see all those factors , 
taken together, affecting the economy going forward?   How are you thinking about those?  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So , there are significant issues out there, as you point out .  Global 
geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated .  And that goes for the war in Ukraine ; it goes for the 
war between  Israel and Hamas.  We’re monitoring that.  O ur job is to monitor those things for 
their economic implications.  So, the UAW strike, as you point out  is—appears to be coming to 
an end.  Oil prices have flattened out ; they haven ’t gone down.  I guess they ’ve gone down a 
little bit from their earlier peak.  Another one is the possibility of government shutdown; we 
don’t know about that one.  So there ’s plenty of risk out there.  But I would go back to—the 
bigger picture from our standpoint is, we ’ve got a very strong economy, strong labor market, 
making progress on the labor market, making progress on inflation .  And we ’re very focused on 
getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive.  That’s really our focus.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Great .  And just one quick thing:  Y ou, last month , had gone to 
York, Pennsylvania , where you talked to a lot of —or, yeah, last month, where you talked to a lot 
of small business owners.  Just curious, what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you pick up on and what would you—was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t say I was terribly surprised.  I was very impressed by 
York as a town with a real strategy.  And I would say it ’s very impressive what the people there 
have put together in the face of , you know, some difficult longer- run trends about offshoring of 
manufacturing and that kind of thing.  They ’ve done a great job as a city , I think.  You know, 
what you hear —and it ’s consistent there—which is people are really suffering under high 
inflation.  You were there .  We talked to some people who , you know, were feeling that in their 
businesses and other people who were feeling it in their home lives as well.  You know, i t’s 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 27  
 painful for people —particularly people who don’ t have a lot of extra financial resources who are 
spending most of their incoming, you know, income on the essentials of life.  So we know that .  
That wasn ’t new.  But that did come through very clearly in, in the conversations we had in 
York, and, you know, I walked away from that even —you know, I mean , just thinking that we 
really —the best thing we can do for the U.S. is to restore price stability —fully restore price 
stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible, but also with the least damage 
we can.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  You ’ve spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for 
the economy in order to get inflation down.  But since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected, have you changed your views on that at all —on 
how necessary or inevitable that kind of pain would be, say, for the labor market or overall 
growth?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we ’ve been 
able to achieve , you know, pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of 
increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking cycles like this one.  So 
that’s, that’s  a historically unusual and very welcome result.  And the same is true of growth.  
You know, w e’ve been saying that we need to see below -potential growth .  And growth has been 
strong, but yet we ’re still seeing this.  I think  I still believe , and my colleagues for the most part I 
think still believe, that is likely to be true.   It is still likely to be true —not a certainty —but likely 
that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market —in labor 
market conditions to get , you know, to fully restore price stability.   So—but it ’s only a good 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 27  
 thing that we haven’ t seen it , and I think we know why.  You know, s ince, since  we lifted off, 
we, we have understood that there are really two processes at work here .  One of them —one of 
which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand [that arose] from the 
pandemic and the response to the pandemic.   And the other is , is, you know, restrictive monetary 
policy, which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to recover —time and space 
to recover.   So you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation.  But it’ s 
that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth, it ’s just —it’s supply—you know, supply- side improvements like shortages and 
bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away.  It’ s getting , you know, a significant increase in 
the size of the labor market now, both from labor force participation and from immigration.  That’s a big supply- side, you know, gain that is really helping the economy, and it ’s part of 
why—part of why  GDP is so high is because we’ re getting that supply.  So, we welcome that.  
But I th ink those things will run their course , and we ’re probably still going to be left —we think, 
and I think —we ’ll still be left with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability .  And 
that’s where monetary policy and what we do with demand is still going to be important.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  A gainst that backdrop, if you’ ve gotten any clarity on lags —if you 
have an economy that ’s been so resilient to high rate  increases, does that suggest to you that 
there isn ’t necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and 
that it may have already come into effect?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I continue to think it ’s very hard to say.  So it ’s been one 
year at this meeting —one year ago , this was the fourth of our 75 basis points hikes .  So that ’s a 
full year since then.  I think we are seeing the effects of , of all the hiking we did last year and this 
year—we ’re seeing it.   It’s very hard to know exactly what that might be.  But you can, for 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 27  
 example —an example where you wouldn’ t have felt this yet is , is debt that had been termed out.  
But it’ s going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after.  So —and there 
are little things like that where the effects have just taken time to get into the economy.   So I 
don’t—I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags 
are.  I think trying to make a clear— get a clear answer and say, “ I’m just going to assume this is 
really not a good way to do it. ”  And this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process 
down this year , was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy.  A nd it takes time .  
We know that, and you can’ t rush it.  So, doing—slowing down is giving us , I think , a better 
sense of , of how much more we need to do, i f we need to do more.  
MICHEL LE SMITH.  Michael.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  I ’m 
trying to connect the dots here .  One quick clarification  I wanted to ask about Rachel ’s question 
is, you said you need slower growth.  You had always said before a period of lower -than-trend 
growth.  Has that changed?  And , two, it sounds to me like you’ re basically saying here that kind 
of the dot plot ’s out the window, that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase 
for right now —doesn’ t matter about the turn of the year—a nd that there ’s not an objective way 
to determine whether or not you’ ve got enough tightening in the system.  It ’s just going to be a 
subjective judgment, meeting by meeting.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well so, let ’s talk about the dot plot first.  So the dot plot is a picture 
in time of what the people in the C ommittee think is likely to be appropriate monetary policy in 
light of their own personal economic forecast.   In principle, when things change, it ’s not —that ’s 
not, like , planned that anybody’ s agreed to or that we will do.  That ’s a forecast that would 
change, for example —I mean , many things could change that would cause people to say, “ I 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 27  
 wouldn’ t write down that dot six weeks later. ”  Think of the number of things that could change 
your mind on that.  So  I think the efficacy of the dot plot probably decays over the three -month 
period between that meeting and the next meeting.  But , nonetheless, it ’s out there .  We don’ t—
we do personally update our forecast, but we don’ t formally update the dot plot.  So , you know, I 
think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we’ re thinking about these things .  
We’re laying out there our thinking , and, you know, as we approach the meeting, we ’ll all be —
my colleagues and I will be talking about how we ’re processing that data.  
In terms of —so we ’re not really changing the way—in terms of growth, what I said was 
“below potential .”  So what you have here recently is growth that is —that is temporarily —
potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its trend level.  So the right way to 
think about it is, what ’s potential growth this year?  People think trend growth over a long period 
of time is a little bit less than 2 percent , or I would say just around 2 percent.  But what we ’ve 
had is , with the—with the, you know, improvement in the size of the labor force, as I mentioned, 
through both participation and immigration, and with the , the, you know, the better functioning 
in the labor market and with the —with the, you know, the unwinding of the supply chain and 
shortages and those kinds of things, you’ re seeing actually elevated potential growth.  There ’s 
catch -up growth that can happen in potential.  And that means that if you ’re growing— you could 
be growing at 2 percent this year and still be growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy.  I hope that ’s clear.  That’s really what ’s going on.  That ’s why I would say it as 
below potential.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  But if you could clarify what I asked about the meeting by 
meeting, are we essentially now supposed to assume that it ’s a meeting by meeting, live meeting 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 27  
 with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on subjective criteria rather than objective at 
each meeting? 
CHAIR POWELL.  I mean, I don’ t know that I want to just accept anybody’ s 
characterization, but I ’ll tell you how we ’re doing this.  So, we ’re going meeting by meeting.  
We’re asking ourselves whether we’ ve achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive 
to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time .  That’s the question we ’re asking.  We ’re looking 
at the full range of economic data, including financial conditions  and all of those things that we 
look at, and then we ’re, we’re —you know, we’ve, we’ve  come very far with this rate hiking 
cycle, very far.   And you saw the spread at the September meeting of —you know, it’ s a 
relatively small spread of—people  think one or two additional hikes.  So  you’ re close to the —to 
the end of the cycle.  That’s —that was an impression as of, I believe, as of September.   It’s not a 
promise or a plan of the future.  And so we ’re going into these meetings one by one .  We’re 
looking at the data .  As I mentioned, w e’re also —we ’re being careful .  We’re proceeding 
carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time.  Monetary policy is restrictive .  We see 
its effects, particularly in interest -sensitive spending and other channels .  So that ’s how I think 
about it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  In light of the run -up 
in long- term yields we’ ve seen the last several weeks, have you given any consideration to the 
pace of your asset runoff program?   And if there were judgment that higher —that the higher -
term premium was endangering the dual -mandate goals, would that be reason to think about 
slowing or suspending QT or should we think of that as a more technical question around 
reserves?  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.   So the C ommittee is not considering changing the pace of balance 
sheet runoff.  It’ s not something we ’re talking about or considering, and I know there are many 
candidate explanations for why rates have been going up.  A nd QT is certainly on that list.  It 
may be playing a relatively small effect, although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves, it ’s 
not—I think —I think it’s hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point.   
So that ’s not something that we ’re—that we’re looking at right now.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.   I wanted to ask about the Basel 
III Endgame capital proposal.  You ’ve gotten a lot of “ pushback”  from people on different 
aspects of the proposal , and you yourself expressed some reservations .  And I’m just curious :  
Could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, that proposal is out for comment.  And we expect a lot of 
comment .  We won ’t get those comments until the end of, well , into next year .  You know, 
we’ve extended the deadline.  And we ’ll take them seriously.  We’ ll read them.  I’ll say what , 
what  I do expect is that we will—we will come to a—we ’re a consensus -driven organization.  
We’ll come to a package that  has broad support on the Board.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  So is broad support mean more support than the proposal had?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It means broad support.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jonnelle.  
JONN ELLE MARTE.  Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg.   So, in addition to persistence, 
when you look at long -term T reasury yields, what else are you watching to evaluate how those 
tighter financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further 
tightening?  Also, do you think that those higher yields could affect banking stress?  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So what do we look at ?  We look at a very wide range of financial 
conditions and, in fact, as you’ ll know, different organizations publish different financial 
conditions ’ indexes , which can have , you know, 7 or 8 variables, or they can have 100 variables, 
so there ’s a very rich environment .  And we tend to look at a few of them.   I’m not going to give 
you the names, but , you know, they’ re a few of the common ones that people look at.  And so 
they’ re looking at things like the level of the dollar, the level of equity prices, the level of rates, 
the credit spreads.  S ometimes they ’re pulling in credit availability and things like that, so it isn ’t 
any one thing.  We would never look at , for example, long -term T reasury rates in isolation , nor 
would we ignore them.  But we would look at them as part of a broader picture , and they do play 
a role , of course, in many of the major standard financial condition indexes.  Your second 
question was?  
JONN ELLE MARTE.  On the banking stress.  
CHAIR POWELL.   Banking stress —so it’s something we’ re watching .  As you know, 
we, we did have —there were issues with interest  rate risk and also funding uninsured deposits in 
the March —the things we went through in March and thereafter .  And so we ’ve been working a 
lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have good funding plans and good—and that 
they have a plan for how to deal with the kind of portfolio, unrealized , losses that they have .  
And we do think the banking system is quite resilient .  We had , you know, a handful of bank 
failures but —so that ’s, that’s  what we ’re out there doing.  And we don ’t have any reason to think 
that this—that these rate hikes are materially changing that picture , which is one of a strong 
banking system and one where there ’s a strong focus by banks and by supervisors on liquidity, 
on funding, and those sorts of things.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Scott.

Page 19 of 27  
 SCOTT HORSLEY.   Thanks , Mr. Chairman.  Scott Horsley from NPR.  Last week you 
and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for 
comment .  Could you just talk a little bit about the considerations there —what it would mean for 
merchants, for banks, for consumers, and also just what you all are seeing in terms of the use of both debit  and credit cards in the —in the payment system ? 
CHAIR POWELL.   You know, s o you’ re right .  We put a proposal out for comment , is 
what we did.  And , you know, this is a job that Congress assigned us , as you, of course , know, in 
Dodd- Frank, and all we can really do is faithfully implement the statute .  That’s, that’s  all we ’re 
trying to do.  What else can we really do?  It’ s a 90 -day comment period,  and we typically don ’t 
comment on these things once they ’re out for —out for comment .  And we do hope that 
stakeholders —and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views.  They 
haven’ t been shy about that.  So that ’s, that’s  critical and that ’s, that’s  what I can say about that 
now. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you.  T hanks , Chair.  Edward Lawrence with F ox 
Business.  So for the last three months, the year -over-year PCE inflation was at 3.4 percent, core 
well over 3 percent.  You ’ve said in the past, 2 percent remains the Federal Reserve target, but 
with no rate increase today, how long would you be okay then with a 3 percent or 3 percent plus overall inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.   You know, t he, the progress is probably going to come in lumps and 
be bumpy, but we ’re making progress.  You know, I think the core PCE [inflation rate] came 
down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter.  So  the best thing I could point you to would 
be the September SEP where , you know, the expectation was that , that  inflation by the end of 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 27  
 next year, on a 12- month trailing basis, would be well into the 2s  and the year after that, further 
into the 2s.   So that ’s, that’s —if you look historically, that ’s, that’s  sort of consistent with the 
way inflation comes down.  It does take some time, and as you get —you know, as you get 
further and further from those highs, it may actually take longer time.  But the good news is, you 
know, we ’re making progress and monetary policy is restrictive.  A nd we feel like we ’re on a 
path to make more progress , and it ’s essential that we do.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   But you’ ve said in the past that doing too little on interest 
rates could take years to fix, but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed.  How robust was the debate about this pause on the doing- too-little side?  
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s always the question we’ re asking ourselves.  And we know 
that, if we fail to restore price stability, the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get 
entrenched in the economy, and we know that that ’s really bad for people.  Inflation will be both 
more —both higher and more volatile .  That’s a—that’s a prescription for misery, and , and so 
we’re really committed to not letting that happen.  You know, f or the first year or so of our 
tightening cycle, the risk was all on the side of not doing enough.  We’ re, you know, we’re —
we’ve come far enough that , that  the risks , you know, have gotten more two sided.  You can’ t 
identify that with a lot of precision , but it does feel like the , the risks are more two  sided now.  
And—but we ’re committed to getting inflation back down to our target over time , and we will.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Simon. 
SIMON RABINOVI TCH.  Hi, Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist.  Quick follow -up 
to the question about banking stresses —you talked about how the banking system is resilient .  Of 
course , part of the resilience the past year stems from the B ank T erm F unding P rogram that you 
launched in March.  Given that bond prices have not recovered, that unrealized losses are 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 27  
 probably mounting, how likely  is it that you might have to extend that program in March next 
year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Good question.  W e haven ’t really —we haven’ t really been thinking 
about that yet.  We—you know, it’ s November 1, and that ’s a decision we ’ll be making in the 
first quarter of next year.  
SIMON RABINOVI TCH.  Okay .  Sorry.  Quick second question about inflation 
expectations —the U . Michigan  sentiment s urvey showed a big jump in one -year-ahead inflation 
expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2.  Last year you said that particular survey was a really 
decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions .  If it stays elevated next time around, how big 
of an input will that be into your December thinking?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Yeah .  We look at a range of , of things .  I think the , the, the, you 
know, the UM thing got blown out of proportion a little bit .  It was actually a preliminary 
estimate that got revised away .  And I said it was preliminary in it, but that didn ’t get picked up. 
So we look at many, many things .  So really, look across the broad array of surveys and also 
market- based estimates, and , you know, we do that really carefully at every meeting and between 
meetings .  And, you know, there ’s—it’s just cl ear that inflation expectations are in a good place .  
The public does believe that inflation will get back down to 2 percent over time, .  And it will—
they’re right.  So —and there ’s no real crack in that—in that armor.  Y ou can always find one 
reading that is a little bit out of whack , but, honestly, the bulk of them are just very clear that the 
public believes that inflation will come down .  And that ’s, of course —we believe that ’s critical 
in winning the battle.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Megan.  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 27  
 MEGAN CASSELLA.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Megan Cassella with Barron ’s.  Thanks for 
taking our questions.  I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate.  You mentioned 
today that you’ re still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive , and you’ ve recently said 
that evidence is suggesting policy is not too tight right now.  So I was curious if you could 
elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate, in your view , has risen.  
CHAIR POWELL.   Yeah .  So first thing to say is that it’ s very important .  It’s a very 
important variable in , in the way we think about monetary policy, but you can’ t identify it with 
any precision in real  time.  And we know that.  So you have to just take that —you have to take 
your estimate of it with a grain of salt.   What we know now is , you know, within a range of 
estimates of the neutral rate policy, is restrictive, and it ’s therefore putting downward pressure on 
economic activity, hiring, and inflation.  So we do—we do  talk about this .  There’s not any 
debate or attempt to , you know, to sort of agree as a group on what —whether r * has moved or 
not.  Some people think it has, some people haven’ t said —that don’ t think it has.   Ultimately , it’s 
unknowable, and so really again, what we ’re focused on is , you know, looking at the data and 
giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in our 
moves .  Does it —does it  feel like monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation down 
to 2 percent over time?  That’s the question we ’re asking ourselves.  I think , you know, years 
from now economists will be revising their estimates of r* as it existed on November 1, 2023.  
You can’ t—we can ’t really wait for th at in making policy.  We have to look—we have to have 
those models and look at them and think about them , and, ultimately , we’ve got to look at the 
effects that policy is having, accounting for the lags, which makes i t difficult.  
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 27  
 MEGAN CASSELLA.   If I could follow  up on a wages point .  Earlier you talked about 
the inflation outlook, but I ’m curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation at its 
current level could be —could risk pushing up overall inflation or re -acceleration ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So , if you look at the —look at the broad range of wages, they have —
wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a 
level where they ’re substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2 percent 
inflation over time, making standard assumptions about productivity over time.  So it ’s much 
closer than it was.   And that ’s true of the ECI, which is the one that ’s—the one that  we got this 
week .  It’s true of average hourly earnings and compensation per hour , too.  So —and all of them 
are kind of saying that, which is great.  And you have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be idiosyncratic from—in any given reading.  So that ’s what you see.  And so what 
you saw with the ECI reading was , if you look back a couple —it comes out four times a year— if 
you look back a couple of quarters, you’ ll see it was much higher , then it  came down 
substantially in June .  And then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the 
June reading .  So, in a way, it ’s just validating that decline, and it was very close to our 
expectations internally , too.  So I think we feel good about that.  Also I would say it isn’ t—in my 
thinking, it ’s not the case that , that  wages have been the princip al driver of inflation so far, 
although I think it ’s all—I do think it ’s fair to say that , as we go forward, as monetary policy 
becomes more important relative to the supply- side issues I ’ve talked about in the unwinding of 
the pandemic e ffects, it may be that the labor market becomes more important over time , too.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Nancy. 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 24 of 27  
 NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you 
are about getting inflation down to the 2 percent target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , as I mentioned, I think for much of the last year and a half, the 
concern was not doing too, too—not doing enough.  I t was not getting rates high enough in time 
to avoid having inflation expectations —higher inflation expectations become entrenched.  S o 
that was the concern.   I think we ’ve reached , you know, now more than 18 months into this .  
You can see by the fact that we have slowed down, although we ’re still —we’re still —we’re still  
trying to gain confidence in what the appropriate sta nce is.   But you can see that .  We think, and 
I think, that the risks are getting more balanced.  I’ll just say that they ’re getting more balanced.  
The risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little are getting —are getting more —
closer to balance, because policy is I think clearly restrictive at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent .  That range, if 
you take off a mainstream estimate of the expected inflation, take one year inflation, you’ re 
going to see that .  You’re going to see a real policy rate that is well abo ve mainstream estimates 
of a neutral policy rate.   Now that ’s arithmetic .  It doesn’ t really —the proof is really in how the 
economy reacts, but I would say that we ’re in a place where those risks are getting closer to 
being in balance.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Okay .  And you said the proof is how the economy 
reacts.  What are you looking at to be sure you’ re not overshooting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think what we ’re looking at is are we still— is inflation still 
broadly cooling?  Do we —is it sort of validating the path we saw over the summer, where 
inflation was clearly cooling and coming down.  Now we ’ve seen periods like that before, and 
they’ ve just —there hasn’t been follow -through.  T he data have bounced back.  So what are we 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 25 of 27  
 seeing?  Are we seeing —is inflation still coming down?  So that ’s the first thing.  The second 
thing is , in the labor market , what we ’ve seen is a very positive rebalancing of supply and 
demand, partly through just much more supply coming online .  And with labor demand still 
clearly remaining very strong—when you have the kind of job growth we ’ve had over the last 
quarter , it’s still very strong demand.  So —and you see wage increases coming down as we 
discussed but coming down in a kind of gradual way.  I think that ’s—we  want to see that, that 
whole set of processes continue.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Bryan. 
BRYAN MENA.  Bryan Mena, CNN.  Do you think that there has been any structural 
change in either consumption or in the job market that ’s pushing at consumption?   You 
obviously saw the third- quarter GDP figures, which were strong, and some economists expect 
everyone’s spending to have fizzled out by now .  So I’m kind of wondering if there ’s been any 
structural change in consumption.  
CHAIR POWELL.   I wouldn’ t say there ’s been a structural change in consumption .  I 
would say it ’s certainly been strong.  A nd so a couple of things .  We may have underestimated 
the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses, and that may be part of it.  There 
may be —you know, we ’ve been , like everyone else, trying to estimate the number —the amount 
of savings that households have from the pandemic when they couldn’ t spend on services really 
at all, or in -person services.   And , you know, there can still be more of that than we think, 
although at a certain point we have to—we ’re going to be getting back to pre -pandemic levels of 
savings.  We may not be there yet.   So things are —clearly , people are still spending.  The 
dynamic has been really strong job creation with now  wages that are—that are higher than 
inflation, in the aggregate anyway, and that raises real disposable income, and that raises 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 26 of 27  
 spending, which continues to drive more hiring.  A nd so you’ ve had a really —that whole —that 
whole dynamic has been, and also at the same time, the pandemic effects are wearing off , so that 
goods availability, automobile availability is better —or was better, I think it still is .  And, from a 
business standpoint, there are more people to hire.  And it is more labor supply.  So  the whole 
thing has led to more growth, more spending, and that kind of thing.  And i t’s been —you know, 
it’s been  good, and the thing is, we ’ve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this.  
So, it ’s been a dynamic .  The question is , how long can that continue?  And , you know, I just 
think this —the existence of this second set of factors at this time, which is the unwinding of the 
pandemic e ffects, that ’s what makes this cycle unique, I think, and, you know, we ’re still 
learning .  That took l onger for that process to begin than we thought, and we ’re still learning 
about how it plays out.  That’s all we can do.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Let’s go to  Daniel for the last question.  
DANIEL AVIS.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  I ’m Daniel Avis from Agence France -Press e.  
Just a quick question following up on an earlier one with regards to the Israel –Hamas conflict. 
The F ed’s Financial Stability Report said the Israel –Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine 
“pose important risks to global economic activity, including the possibility of sustained 
disruptions to regional trade and food, energy, and other commodities.”   You ’ve had 
organizations at the W orld Bank warning of a possibl e surge in oil prices if the war spreads to 
other countries in the region.  I ’m just wondering how the F ed is monitoring these developments 
in the Middle East —you mentioned they are —and just what the potential economic impact could 
be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region.  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t want to speculate too much, but I ’ll just say so —you 
know, really the question there is , does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things 
November 1, 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 27 of 27  
 like affect oil prices in particular, since this is the Middle East we ’re talking about.  The price of 
oil has really not reacted very much so far to this.   As the —you know , as the F ed—as the Federal 
Open Market Committee, our job is really to talk about  [and]  to understand the economy and 
economic e ffects.  A nd it isn’ t clear , at this point,  that the conflict in the Middle East is going 
to—is on track to have significant economic e ffects.  That doesn ’t mean it isn ’t incredibly 
important and something for p eople to , you know, to take really important notice of, but it may 
or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an 
economic body.  Bu t—so what the Financial Stability Report  does is it “ calls out ” risks .  And 
that’s what it ’s doing— [it] is calling out a risk of that . 
And the war in Ukraine, the same.  The w ar in Ukraine did have , immediately , very 
significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to commodities.  
So, thank you.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
December 13, 2023 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  
As we approach the end of the year, it ’s natural to look back on the progress that has been 
made toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come 
without a significant increase in unemployment.  That ’s very good news.  But inflation is still too 
high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.  As 
we look ahead to next year, I want to assure the American people that we’ re fully committed to 
returning inflation to our 2 pe rcent goal.  Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a 
sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.  
Since early last year, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary 
policy.  We ’ve raised our policy interest rate by 5¼ percentage points and have continued to 
reduce our securities holdings at a brisk pace.  Our actions have moved our policy rate well into 
restrictive territory, meaning that tight policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity 
and inflation, and the full effects of our tightening likely have not yet been felt.  
Today, we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to reduce 
our securities holdings.  Given how far we have come, along with the uncertainties and risks that 
we face, the Committee is proceeding carefully.  We will make decisions about the extent of any 
additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  I will have more to say about 
monetary policy after briefly reviewi ng economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity has slowed substantially from 
the outsized pace seen in the third quarter.  Even so, GDP is on track to expand around 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 24  
 2½ percent for the year as a whole, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving 
supply conditions.  After picking somewhat over the —up somewhat over the summer, activity in 
the housing sector has flattened out and remains well below the levels of a year ago, largely reflecting higher mortgage rates.  Higher interest rates also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.  In our Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP) , Committee participants 
revised up their assessments of GDP growth this year but expect growth to cool, with the median projection falling to 1.4 percent next year.  
The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into 
better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 204,000 jobs per month, a strong pace that is nevertheless below that seen earlier in the year.  The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7  percent.  Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the 
supply of workers .  The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year, particularly 
for individuals aged  25 to 54 years, and imm igration has returned to pre -pandemic levels.  
Nominal wage growth appears to be easing, and job vacancies have declined.  Although 
the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available 
workers.  FOMC participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressures on inflation.  The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP rises somewhat from 3.8 percent at the end of this year to 4.1 percent at the end of next year.  
Inflation has eased over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 2 percent.  
Based on the c onsumer price index and other data, we estimate that total PCE prices rose 
2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in November and that, excluding the volatile food and 
energy categories, core PCE prices rose 3.1  percent.  
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 24  
 The lower inflation readings over the past several months are welcome, but we will need 
to see further evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 
goal.  
Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a 
broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  As is evident from the SEP, we anticipate that the process of getting inflation 
all the way to 2 percent will take some time.  The median projection in the SEP is 2.8 percent this year, falls to 2.4 percent next year, and reaches 2  percent in 2026.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We 
are highly , highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and 
we are strongly committed to returning inf lation to our 2 percent objective. 
As I noted earlier, since early last year, we have raised our policy rate by 5 ¼ percentage 
points, and we have decreased our securities holdings by more than $1 trillion.  Our restrictive 
stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.  The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  
While we believe that our policy rate is likely at or near its peak for this tightening cycle, 
the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress —sorry —ongoing progress  toward our 2  percent inflation objective is not assured.  We 
are prepared to tighten policy further if appropriate.  We ’re committed to achieving a stance of 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 24  
 monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2  percent 
over time and to keeping policy restrictive until we ’re confident that inflation is on a path to that 
objective.  
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most 
likely scenario going forward.  While participants do not view it as likely to be appropriate to raise interest rates further, neither do they want to take the possibility off the table.  If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6  percent at the en d of 2024, 3.6 percent at the end of 2025, and 
2.9 percent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer -term rate.  
These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the economy does not evolve 
as projected, the path of  policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our maximum -employment 
and price -stability goals. 
In light of the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the Committee is 
proceeding carefully.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the 
totality of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation , as well as the balance of risks.  In determining the extent of any additional policy 
firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2  percent over time, the Committee will 
take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.  We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -
term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.

 To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Chris  Rugaber . 
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you.  Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.  I wanted 
to ask, how should we interpret the addition of the word “ any” before “ additional . . . firming ” in 
the statement ?  I mean , does that mean that you ’re pretty much done with rate hikes and the 
Committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and toward a more neutral stance?  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So —specifically on “any” :  We do say that “ in determining the 
extent of any additional policy firming that may be appropriate ,” so “any additional policy 
firming ”—that sentence.  So we added the word “any” as an acknowledgement that we believe 
that we are likely at or near the , the peak rate for this cycle.  Participants didn’t write down 
additional hikes that we believe are likely, so that’s what we wrote down.  But participants also didn’t want to take the possibility of further hikes off the table.  So that’s really what we were 
thinking.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Happy holidays, Mr. Chairman.  Fed 
Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall, then the Fed in the next several 
months could be cutting interest rates.  I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with Fed Governor Waller on that, that the Fed would become more restrictive if it didn ’t cut 
rates if inflation fell.  Thank you, sir.  
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So, of course, I don’ t comment on , on any other officials, even those 
who work at the F ed.  But I ’ll—but I’ll try to answer your question more broadly.  So the way—
the way  we’re looking at it is , is really this.  When we started out, right, we said the first question 
is, how fast to move, and we moved very fast.  The second question is, you know, really, how 
high to raise the policy rate ?  And that ’s really the question that we ’re still on here.  We ’re, we’re  
very focused on that , as I—as I  mentioned.  P eople generally think that we ’re at or n ear that and , 
and think it ’s not likely that we will hike, although they don’ t take that possibility off the table.  
So that ’s—when you get to that question, and that ’s your answer, there ’s a natural —naturally , it 
begins to be the next question, which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back 
the amount of policy restraint that’ s in place.  
So that ’s really the next  question, and that ’s what people are thinking about and, and 
talking about.  And I would just say this .  We are seeing, you know, strong growth that  is—that  
appears to be moderating ; we’re seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so 
many measures;  and we ’re seeing inflation making real progress.  These are the things we’ ve 
been wanting to see.  We can ’t know .  We still have a ways to go.  No one is declaring victory.  
That would be premature .  And we can ’t be guaranteed of this progress  [continuing] .  So we ’re, 
we’re  moving carefully in making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not.  And 
that’s, that’s  really the question that we ’re on.  B ut, of course, the other question, the question of 
when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that, that  begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion —topic of discussion out in the 
world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today?   
Thank you. 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So it , it comes up in this way today.  Everybody wrote down 
an SEP forecast .  So many people mentioned what their —what their rate forecast was .  And there 
was no back -and-forth, no attempt to sort of reach agreement like , “This is what I wrote down ; 
this is what I think, ” that kind of thing, a nd a preliminary kind of a discussion like that.  N ot 
everybody did that, but many people did.  And then, and I would say, there ’s a general 
expectation that this will be —this will be  a topic for us , looking ahead.  That, t hat’s really what 
happened in today’ s meeting.  I can ’t do the head count for you in real time .  But that ’s generally 
what happened today.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  At this point, can you confidently say that the economy has avoided a 
recession and isn ’t heading for one now ?  And if the answer is “ no,” I’m curious about what 
you’d still be looking for.   Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think you can say that there ’s little basis for thinking that the 
economy is  in a recession now.  I would say that.  
I think there ’s, there’s  always a probability that , that  there will be a recession in the next 
year, and it ’s a meaningful probability no matter what the economy is doing.  So it ’s always a 
real possibility.  The question is, is it —so it ’s a possibility here.  I have always felt, since the 
beginning, that there was a possibility, because of the unusual situation, that the economy could cool off in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening cycles.  So far, that ’s what we ’re 
seeing.  That ’s what many forecasters , on and off the C ommittee , are seeing.  This result is not 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 24  
 guaranteed.  It is—it is far to o early to declare victory .  And there are certainly risks.   It’s 
certainly possible that, that the economy will behave in an unexpected way.  It has done that 
repeatedly through the post —in the post -pandemic period.  Nonetheless, where we are is, is  we 
see the things that I —that I mentioned. 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  I ’m curious , if you ’re looking back on the past year, you talked 
about “ navigating by the stars under cloudy skies.”   Can you talk about some of the ways in 
which the economy surprised you most this year , where you thought it would behave in one way 
and had to pivot to respond?  Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think forecasters generally, if you go back a year, were very 
broadly forecasting a recession for this year, for 2023 .  And not only did that not happen—that 
includes F ed forecasters and really , essentially , all forecasters ; a very high proportion of 
forecasters predicted very weak growth or a recession —not only did that not happen, we actually 
had a very strong year, and that was a combination of , of strong demand but also of real gains on 
the supply side. 
So this was the year when labor force participation picked up, where immigration picked 
up, where the distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic —you know, the shortages 
and the bottlenecks —really began to unwind.  So we had significant supply- side gains with 
strong demand, and we got what looks like a 2½ percent -plus, or a little more than that , growth 
year at a time when potential growth this year might even have been higher than that, just 
because of the healing on the supply side.  So that was a surprise to just about everybody. 
I think the inflation forecast is roughly , roughly what people wrote down a year ago, but 
in a very different setting .  And I would say the labor market , because of the stronger growth, has 
also been significantly better.  If you look back at the SEP from a year ago, there was a 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 24  
 significant increase in , in unemployment.  It didn ’t really happen.  We’ re still at 3.7  percent.  So 
we’ve seen, you know, strong growth, still a tight labor market but one that ’s coming back into 
balance with the—with support from the supply side, a greater supply of labor.  It ’s a— you 
know, that ’s, that’s  what we see, and I think that combination was, was not anticipated broadly.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for 
taking the questions.  I, I wonder if you could give a little more color or detail on what —on what  
motivates the lower rates next year, whether it’ s a coincidence, for example, that the spread 
between PC E inflation, core inflation, and the federal funds rate stays constant over the year.  
Are you simply calibrating against the fall in prices, in the price level that you ’re expecting, in 
the rate of inflation that you ’re expecting as o pposed to supporting the economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Nothing quite that mechanical is happening.  The SEP really is , is a 
bottoms -up—built from the bottom up, right ?  So I think people are looking at what ’s happening 
in the economy.  A nd I think if you look at the big difference from September in the SEP, [it is 
that] the expectations for inflation this year, both headline and core, have come down, you know, 
really significantly in three months.  That’s a big piece of , of this.  At the same time, [real GDP] 
growth has turned out to be very stro ng in the third quarter .  [Now it]  is slowing, we believe, as , 
as appropriate .  And we’ve got —we ’ve had several labor market reports, which suggest, again, 
significant progress toward greater balance across a very —a broad range of indicators.  You’re 
seeing so many of the indicators coming back to normal, not all of them.  But so I think that 
people look at that, and they write down their —basically, each individual writes down a forecast 
and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast.  We tabulate them and , and publish it.  And s o it’s 
not—it isn ’t—you ask about real rates, I take it ? 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 24  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Yes.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Y ou know, that’s —that is —that is  something that we ’re very 
conscious of , and aware of , and monitor, and it ’s certainly a big part of —it’s a part of how we 
think about things .  But, really , it’s broader financial conditions that matter.  And , as you well 
know, it ’s so hard to know exactly, you know, what the —what the  real rate is or exactly how 
tight policy is at any given time.  So you couldn’ t follow that like it was a rule and think that you 
would get the right answer all the time, but it’ s certainly something that we ’re focused on .  And, 
indeed, if you look at the projections, I think the expectation would be that the real rate is 
declining as we—as we move forward. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  It sounds like the discussion—if I  could follow up—has , has 
already kind of begun.  I ’m wondering, just related to, to Steve ’s question, how the —how the  
tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 
2024, the closer you get to a presidential election.  Do you want to front -load this, in other 
words?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  No , we—we’re —we  don’ t think about political events.  We 
don’t think about politics.  We think about what ’s the right  thing to do for the economy.  The 
minute we start thinking about those things —you know, we just can’ t do that.  We have to think, 
what ’s the right thing ?  We’ll do the things that we think are right for the economy at the time 
we—when we think is the right time.  That ’s what we ’ll always do. 
So I mentioned we ’re moving carefully.  One of the things we ’re moving carefully about 
is that decision over —that assessment, really —over whether , whether  we’ve done enough, 
really.  And you see that people are not writing  down  rate hikes.  That ’s, that’s  us thinking that 
we have done enough but not , not feeling that really strongly , confidently and not wanting to 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 24  
 take the possibility of a rate hike off the table.  Nonetheless, it ’s not the base case anymore, 
obviously, as it was, you know, 60, 90 days ago.  So that ’s, that’s  how  we’re —that’s how  we’re 
approaching things .  And, and, you know, as I mentioned, we wrote down this SEP, and it talks 
about —people have individual assessments of when it will be appropriate to, you know, to start 
to dial back on, on the tight policy we have in place, and that ’s a discussion we’ ll be having 
going forward.  But that ’s another a ssessment that we’ re going to make very carefully, so as time 
goes forward. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, you ’ve 
argued over the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the 
market anticipated your moves and tightened on your behalf.  The market is now easing policy 
on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by next September that ’s a full point below the 
current level , with cuts beginning around March.  Is this something that you are broadly 
comfortable with?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  this last year has been remarkable for the , the sort of seesaw 
thing, the back -and-forth we ’ve had over the course of the year of markets moving away and 
moving back and that kind of thing.  So, and what I would just say is that we , we focus on what 
we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals, and that ’s what we really 
focus on.  And people are going to have different forecasts about the economy, and they’ re going 
to—those are going to show up in market conditions, or they won’ t, you know .  But in any case, 
we have to do what we think is right.  
And, you know, in the long run, it ’s important that financial conditions become aligned 
or are aligned with what we ’re trying to accomplish, and, in the long run, they will be, of course, 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 24  
 because we will do what it takes to get to our goals.  And , ultimately , that will mean that 
financial conditions will , will come along.  But in the meantime, there can be back- and-forth, 
and, you know, I ’m just focused on what ’s the right thing for us to do.  A nd my colleagues are 
focused on that , too.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  The markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly.  Do 
you believe we ’re at the point where inflation is coming down credibly?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Listen, I welcome the progress.  I think it’ s, it’s really good to see the 
progress that we ’re making.  I think if you look at the 12- month—look at the 6-month measures, 
you see very low numbers.  If you look at 12- month measures, you’ re still well above 2  percent.  
You’re actually above 3  percent on core , through November , PCE  [inflation].  That isn ’t to say —
I’m not, you know, calling into question the progress.  It ’s great.  We just need to see more.  We 
need to see, you know, continued further , further progress toward getting back to 2 percent.  
That’s, that’s  what we need to see.  
So, you know, our —it’ s our job to restore price stability.  And that —it’s one of our two 
jobs, along with maximum employment, and they ’re equal.  So we ’re very focused on, on, you 
know, doing that.  As I mentioned, we ’re moving carefully at this point.  We’re pleased with the 
progress, but , but we see the need for further progress, and I think—I think  it’s fair to say there is 
a lot of uncertainty about going forward.  We’ ve seen the economy move in surprising 
directions, so we ’re just going to need to see more further progress.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   Thanks for taking our 
questions.  In the SEP from today, [real GDP] growth is notably below potential in 2024.  If 
growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years now by being stronger than 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 24  
 expected next year, would it still be possible to cut rates ?  Or, put another way, is below -trend 
growth necessary to cut rates, or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’ll, we’ll  look at the totality of the data.  Growth is one thing, 
so is inflation , so is labor market data.  So we ’d, we’d  look at the totality .  As we—as we make 
decisions about policy changes going forward, we ’re going to be look ing at all those things and, 
particularly , about  the—as they affect the outlook.  So it ’s ultimately all about the outlook and 
the balance of risk s as well.  So that ’s what —that’s what  we’d be looking for.  
If we have stronger growth, you know, that ’ll be good for people.  That ’ll be good for the 
labor market.  It might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 
2 percent.  We will get it down to 2  percent, but , you know, if we see stronger growth, we’ll—we 
will set policy according to what we actually see .  And, and so that ’s how I would answer. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  I guess the —I guess the question I ’m asking, if you don’ t mind a 
quick follow -up, I guess the question I ’m asking is, is above -trend growth itself a problem?  
CHAIR POWELL.   It’s only a problem inso— it’s not itself a problem.  It ’s only a 
problem insofar as it makes it more difficult for us to achieve our goals.  And, you know, if you 
have —if you have  growth that ’s robust , what that will mean is probably it will keep the labor 
market very strong.  It probably will , will place some upward pressure on inflation.  That could 
mean that it takes longer to get to 2  percent inflation.  That could mean we need to keep rates 
higher for longer.  It could even mean , ultimat ely, that we would need to hike again.  It just is —
it’s the way , the way  our policy works. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  How do you interpret the state 
of the labor market right now ?  And, in particular, you’ ve referred even today to evidence that 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 24  
 it’s coming into better balance.  What would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that 
balance?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So on, on the better- balance side, there  are just a lot of things.  It’s—
you see —you see  job growth still strong but moving back down to more sustainable levels , given 
population growth and labor force participation.  The things that are not quite —but let me go on 
with that list.  You know, claims are low.  If you look at surveys of businesses, they ’re, they’re —
sort of the era of this frantic labor shortage , [those kinds of worker shortages]  are behind us, and 
they’ re seeing a shortage of lab or as being significantly alleviated.  If you look at shortages of 
workers, whereas they thought job, job availability was the highest that it ’d ever been or close to 
it, that’s now down to more normal levels  by so many measures —participation, 
unemployment —so many measures:   the unemployment —job openings, quits, all of those 
things.  
So wages are still running a bit above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation 
over a long period of time.  They ’ve been gradually cooling off .  But if wages are running around 
4 percent, that ’s still a bit above, I would say.  And I guess there , there  are just a couple of 
other —the unemployment rate is very, very low.  And these are —but , but I would just say, 
overall , the development of the labor market has been very positive.  It ’s been a good time for 
workers to find jobs and get solid wage inc reases.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire.  
CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   You know, I ’d say the mood among 
economists at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism, which is somewhat 
corroborated by your forecast by the sense that we  are going to have a soft landing.  Yet when  
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 24  
 we—when we hear from the general public, there’ s a lot of discord about economic conditions.  
What do you think explains this disconnect, and does it matter for policy makers ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  It may be.  A common theme is that, while inflation is coming down, 
and that ’s very good news, the price level is not coming down.  Prices of some , some  goods and 
services are coming down.  B ut overall, in the aggregate, the price level is not .  So people are 
still living with high prices, and that ’s, that’s  not—that is something that people don’ t like.  And, 
you know, so  what will happen with that is , wages are now —[changes in] real wages are now 
positive .  So [nominal] wages are now moving up more than inflation, as inflation comes down.  
And so that might help improve the mood of people.  
But we do see those —we see those public opinion surveys.  The thing that we can do is 
to do our jobs, which is to use our tools to foster price stability, which has such great benefits 
over such long periods of time , and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and 
achieve an extended period of high employment, which is so beneficial for, you know, families 
and, and companies around the country.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  I wanted to ask, you know, on, 
on the flip side of if things start to deteriorate rapidly, if we do fall into a recession, if we do start 
to see unemployment rise, at sort of the levels of inflation that we ’re seeing now, how would you 
all think about that in terms of rate cuts?  Would that be a sign that you ’ve, you’ve  done your job 
demand- wise?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry —if? 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  If, if the economy starts to —looks like it ’s starting to fall into a 
recession ; if, if the jobless rate starts to rise.  
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s not something we ’re hoping to see.  Obviously, we ’re hoping 
to, to see something very different —which is a continuation of what we have seen, which is the 
labor market coming into better balance without a significant increase in unemployment, 
inflation coming down without a significant increase in unemployment, and growth moderating without a significant increa se in unemployment.  That ’s what we ’re, we’re  trying very much to 
achieve and not something that we ’re looking to see.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  But, but would you take that as a signal that you should cut rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, obviously, what we ’ll do is we ’ll look at the totality of 
the data, as I ’ve mentioned a couple times, and , certainly, the labor data would be important in 
that.  And , you know, if you—if you can describe a situation like that where if, if  there were the 
beginning of a recession or something like that, then, yes, that would certainly weigh heavily on that decision.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio.  Mr. 
Chairman, you were, by your own admission, behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight 
inflation, and you said earlier, again, “ the full effects of our tightening (cycle)  have not yet been 
felt.”  How will you decide when to cut rates, and how will you ensure you’ re not behind the 
curve there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re, we’re  aware of the risk that we would hang on too long.  
You know, w e know that that ’s a risk, and we ’re very focused on not making that mistake.  And 
we do regard the two— you know, we ’ve come back into a better balance between the risk of 
overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it.  Not only that, we were able to focus hard on the —on 
the price -stability mandate .  And we ’re getting back to the point where —which is what you do 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 24  
 when you’ re very far from, from one of them, one of the two mandates —you’re getting now 
back to the point where both mandates are important, and they’ re, they’re  more in balance , too.  
So I think we ’ll be—we’ll be  very much keeping that in mind,  as we make policy going forward.  
And the things we ’ll be looking at, I ’ve already described.  You know, we ’re, we’re  
obviously looking hard at what ’s happening with demand, and what we see ?  We see the same 
thing other people see, which is a strong economy, which really put up quite a performance in 
2023.  We see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth will come in lower next year.  And you see what the forecasts are.  I think the median  growth—median  participant wrote 
down 1.4 percent growth, but , you know, we ’ll have to see.  It’s very hard to predict.  We’ll also 
be looking to see progress on inflation and, you know, the labor market remaining strong but , but 
ideally , without see ing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens sometimes.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  If I could  follow up:  W hen you begin the cutting cycle, will it be 
essentially run the same way you do it now with raising rates, where you basically do trial and 
error, cut and see what happens, or will you tie it to some particular measure of progress?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We haven ’t typically tried to articulate, with one exception, really 
specific target levels, which was if you —some of you will remember the thresholds that we used 
in, I guess, 2013.  I don’t —the answer is, these are things that we haven ’t, you know, really 
worked out yet.  We’re sort of just at the beginning of, of  that discussion.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence of Fox 
Business.  So if the Fed cuts rates as the dot plot is , is showing, about 75 basis points, does that 
signal that there ’s a belief of weakness next year in the economy?

 CHAIR POWELL.  It wouldn’ t, if that were  to—first of all, let me just say, that isn ’t a 
plan.  That ’s, that’s  just cumulating what people wrote down.  So that ’s not something —you 
know this, but allow me to say it again:   We don’ t debate or discuss what the right, you know, 
whose SEP is right.  We just say what they are, and we tabulate them and publish them.  So and 
it’s, you know, it ’s important for people to know that.  But it wouldn’ t need to be a sign of —it 
could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing, and it doesn ’t need the tight policy.  It 
depends on —the economy can evolve in many different ways, right ?  So b ut, but it could be 
more of what I just described.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  And you focused on core  inflation, we ’ve heard from— in 
other meetings.  How sticky is core inflation right now?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, that ’s what we ’re finding out, and we ’ve, you know, we ’ve 
seen real progress in , in core inflation.  It has been sticky, and famously, the service sector is 
thought to be stickier, but we ’ve actually seen reasonable progress in nonhousing services, which 
was the area where, where  you would expect to see less progress.  We are seeing some progress 
there , though.  And, i n fact, all three of the categories of core [prices] are now contributing :  
goods, housing services, nonhousing services.  They ’re all contributing in different—at different 
levels, you know, meeting by meeting—or , rather, report by report.  So, yeah. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  Let ’s go to Catarina.  
CATARINA SARAIVA.  Catarina Saraiva of Bloomberg News.  Thanks for taking our 
questions.  I just wanted to ask a little bit about, you know, we had some pretty positive data this , 
you know, this  morning and yesterday.  I’m assuming those were not incorporated into the 
forecast we see today, but I just wanted to ask, you know, how that kind of adds to your thinking, 
you know, on the inflation outlook.  
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Right.  So we got —we got  CPI the morning of the first day, and we 
got PPI the next day, which informs the, you know, the translation into PCE  [inflation].  So it ’s 
very late in the game, you know, to —but nonetheless, participants are allowed to, encouraged to 
update their SEP forecast until probably midmorning today.  After that, so staff has to —has to  
cumulate all of that and create the documents that you see.  So until about midmorning, a little, 
maybe late morning, it ’s okay to update, and I believe some people did update their forecast 
based on what we saw today.  
CATARINA SARAIVA.  Okay.  And do you see —I mean , how are you, when you think 
about, you know, starting to think about the rate cuts next year or whenever they come, how do 
you, you know, how do you think about the economy we ’re in now kind of post -pandemic ?  Do 
you think that there ’s been significant structural shifts, and is that going to change how you look 
at a rate cut path?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The question of whether there have been fundamental structural 
shifts is , is really hard to know the answer and a very interesting one right now.  The one that 
would affect —the one that comes to mind, though, is just the question of where the neutral rate 
of interest is.  And so, for example, if it ’s risen, and I ’m not saying that it  has, but if it were to 
have risen, that would mean that , that interest rates would need to be a little bit higher to convey 
the same level of restriction.  The t hing is, we ’re not really going to know that.  You know, 
people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it.  So it’s just 
that it’s going to be uncertain.  
So we ’re going to be making policy in this, you know, difficult, uncertain, really 
unprecedented environment.  Some —some one once said that you know the —you know the  
natural rate of interest by its works , and that ’s really right, but that’ s very difficult because policy 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 24  
 operates with a lag.  So that ’s one of the reasons why we slowed down this year.  We started 
slowing down at this meeting last year, reducing the pace at which we were adding restriction.  
And, over the course of this year, we really slowed down a lot to give those lags time to work. 
In terms of demand, has demand shifted more away from services into goods?  There’s—
you can make a case for that, that the shift back into services has not been complete, and it doesn’ t look like it’ s ongoing, but I don’ t know if that ’s right.  Maybe people just bought so 
much stuff that they temporarily don ’t want any more stuff.  They haven’ t got anyplace to put it.  
[Laughter]  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation.  As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3 ½ on core.  On a six -
month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent , though when you look at supercore and 
shelter, they are, of course, stickier.  So when looking in the different components of the data, 
how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I mean, the reason you wouldn’ t wait to get to 2  percent to cut rates 
is that policy would be, it would be too late.  I mean , you’ d want to be reducing restriction on the 
economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’ t overshoot, 
if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.  You know, it takes —it 
takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.  So I can ’t give you a precise answer .  But if you look at what ’s in the —in the  SEP, and , you 
know, I think you’ ll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would 
take.  
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 24  
 JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Do think below 3 percent would be reasonable?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t want to —I wouldn’t want to  identify any one precise 
point , because I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be 
right.  But we ’ll be looking at it and, and looking at the broad collection of factors.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Jean Yung. 
JEAN YUNG.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Jean Yung with Market News.  I wanted to go back to 
the stickiness- of-inflation question.  Over the past couple of years, a lot of central bankers have 
talked about the more difficult last mile of getting inflation back down to 2  percent, yet it ’s also 
been surprising how fast inflation has come down this year.  I’m curious, do you think something 
has changed in our understanding of inflation, or do you subscribe to this notion still ?  Or is it 
something different about the U.S. economy?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  I think —I think  this.  You know, we felt since the beginning that it 
would be a combination of two factors.  The first factor is just the unwinding of, of  what 
happened in the pandemic :  the distortions of supply and demand.  A nd the second thing would 
be our policy, which was weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the 
supply side to recover because of lower demand.  We thought those two things were going to be 
necessary.  Sorry, say your —say the last part of your ques tion again.  
JEAN YUNG.  If there was something different about the U.S. economy.  CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So it ’s not th at—it may or may not be about “different, ” the 
U.S. economy being different.  I think that this inflation was not the classic demand overload, pot-boiling -over, kind of inflation that we [typically] think about.  It was a combination of very 
strong demand, without question, and unusual supply- side restriction s, both on the goods side but 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 24  
 also on the labor side, because we had a—we had a  participation shock.  So this is just very 
unusual . 
And, you know, we had the view —my colleagues and I broadly had the view —that we 
could get a lot of —you know, you had essentially a vertical supply curve , because you ran into 
the limits of, of  capacity at very low levels, because there weren ’t workers and because people 
couldn’ t—the supply chains were all broken.  So we , we had the view that you could come 
straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent demand [was] lowered, reduced.  A nd, you 
know, something like that has happened.  It happened so f ar.  The question is, you know, once , 
once  that part of it runs out—and we think it has a ways to run;  we definitely think that the sort 
of supply chain and shortages side has some , some  ways to run—does labor force participation 
have  much more to run?  It might.  Immigration could help, but it may be that , at some point —at 
some point , you will run out of supply- side help, and then it gets down to demand, and it gets 
harder.  That ’s, that’s  very possible.  But to say with certainty that the last mile is going to be 
different, I’ d be reluctant to, you know, to suggest that we have any certainty around that.  We 
just don’ t know.  I mean , inflation keeps coming down.  The labor market keeps getting back 
into balance.  And it ’s so far , so good —although we kind of assume that it will get harder from 
here.  But so far , it hasn ’t. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Okay.  We’ ll go to Megan for the last question.  
MEGAN CASSELLA.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Thanks for taking our questions.  Megan 
Cassella with Barron’ s.  I want to ask about the balance sheet given the Fed’ s focus now on 
proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts .  And can you talk us through what the latest 
thinking is , and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening 
at all? 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 24  
 CHAIR POWELL.  We’ re, we’re  not talking about altering the pace of QT right now, 
just to get that out of the way.  
So the balance sheet seems to be working pretty much as expected.  What we’ ve been 
seeing is, you know, that we ’re allowing runoff each month.  That’s adding up.  I think we ’re 
down—we ’re close to  1.2 trillion  [dollars].  That ’s showing up.  The reverse repo facility [take -
up] has been coming down quickly, and reserves have been either moving up or —as a result —or 
holding steady.  At a certain point, you know, there won’ t be any more to come out of, or there ’ll 
be a level where [take -up at]  the reverse repo facility levels out.  And , at that point, reserves will 
start to come down. 
You know, we still have —you know that we intend to reduce our securities holdings until 
we judge that the quantity of reserve balances has reached a level somewhat above that 
consistent with  ample reserves, and we also intend to slow and then stop the decline in size of the 
balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level judged to be consistent with 
ample reserves.  We’ re not at those  levels, you know, with, with  reserves close to 3.5  trillion  
[dollars].  We’re not —we don’ t think we ’re at those [ levels judged consistent with ample] 
reserves.  There isn ’t a lot of evidence of that.  We’re watching it carefully .  And, you know, so 
far—so far , it’s working pretty much as expected,  we think.  
MEGAN CASSELLA.  Do you anticipate  adjusting that thinking at all by the time 
you’re, you’re  considering or moving forward with rate cuts?  Is that time to rethink, or are you 
still going to follow that thinking?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think they’ re, they’re  on independent tracks.  You ’re asking, 
though, the question, I guess you’ re implying the question of can you continue with QT at such 
time—QT, which is a tightening action—at such time as policy is still tight ?  And the answer is , 
December 13 , 2023   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 24  
 it depends on the reason.  You know, if you’ re—if you’re —if you’re  cutting rates because you ’re 
going back to normal, that ’s one thing, [ and distinct from] if you’ re cutting them because the 
economy is really weak.  So you can imagine, you’ d have to know what the reason is to know 
whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
January 31, 2024 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  
The economy has made good progress toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has eased 
from its highs without a significant increase in unemployment.  That’ s very good news.  But 
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.  I want to assure the American people that we’ re fully committed to 
returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.  Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditi ons that benefit all.  
Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to 
reduce our securities holdings.  Over the past two years, we ’ve significantly tightened the stance 
of monetary policy.  Our strong actions have moved our policy rate well into restrictive territory, and we ’ve been seeing the effects on economic activity and inflation.  As labor market tightness 
has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.  I will have more to say about monetary policy —
about monetary policy, after briefly reviewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.  
GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.3 percent.  For 2023 as a whole, GDP expanded at 3.1 percent, bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as im proving supply 
conditions.  Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates.  High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 27  
 The labor market remains tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to come into 
better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 165,000 jobs per month, a 
pace that is well below that seen a year ago but still strong.  The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent.  Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers .  The labor force participation rate has moved up , on balance , over the past year, 
particularly for individuals aged 25 to 54 years , and immigration has returned to pre -pandemic 
levels.  Nominal wage growth has been easing, and job vacancies have declined.  Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.  
Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 
2 percent.  Total PCE prices rose 2.6  percent over the 12 months ending in December; excluding 
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent .  The lower inflation 
readings over the second half of last year are welcome .  But we will need to see continuing 
evidence to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our goal.  Longer -
term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  
The Fed ’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We’re highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and 
we’re strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. 
Over the past two years, we have raised our policy rate by 5¼  percentage points, and 
we’ve decreased our securities holdings by more than $1.3 trillion.  Our restrictive stance of 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 27  
 monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.  The 
Committee decided at today ’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 
5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings.  
We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle and that, if the 
economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year.  But the economy has surpris ed forecasters in many ways since 
the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured.  The economic outlook is uncertain, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  We ’re prepared 
to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for longer if appropriate.  
As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to 
achieving our employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance.  We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal o f the progress we ’ve 
seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent.  At 
the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic 
activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target 
range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.  
We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to 
keeping longer -run— longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability 
is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer  run. 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 27  
 To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We at the 
Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  I look forward to our questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna . 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.   Thanks for taking our 
questions.  Obviously, in the statement and just in your remarks there, you note that you don’ t 
want to cut interest rates without greater confidence that inflation is coming —coming down 
fully.  I wonder —what do you need to see at this point to gain that confidence?  And as you 
make those decisions, how are you weighing recent strong growth in consumer spending data against the sort of solid inflation progress you ’ve been seeing? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sorry —say that last part again.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  How are —how are  you weighing the growth data and 
consumption data, which have been surprisingly strong, against inflation data?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay.  So, what are we looking for to get greater confidence?   Let 
me say that we have confidence.  We ’re—we’re  looking for greater confidence that inflation is 
moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  Implicitly, we do have confidence , and it has been 
increasing, but we want to get greater confidence .  What do we want to see?  We want to see 
more good data.  It ’s not that we ’re looking for better data.  It’s—we’re looking at continuation 
of the good data that we ’ve been seeing, and a good example is inflation.  So we have six months 
of good inflation data.  The question really is, that six months of good inflation data —is it 
sending us a true signal that we are, in fact, on a path—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation?   That ’s the question.  And the answer will come from some more data that ’s also good 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 27  
 data.  It doesn’t —it’s not that the six -month data isn’ t—isn’t  low enough.  It is.  It’s just a 
question of, can we take that with confidence that we ’re moving sustainably down to 2 percent?  
That’s really what we’ re thinking about. 
In terms of, of  growth, we ’ve had strong growth.  I mean, if you take a step back, we ’ve 
had strong growth—very strong growth [in real GDP] last year —going right into the fourth 
quarter.  And yet we ’ve had a very strong labor market, and we ’ve had inflation coming down.  
So I think —whereas a year ago , we, we were thinking that we needed to see some softening in 
economic activity—that hasn’ t been the case.  So I think we , we look at —we look at  stronger 
growth.  We don’ t look at it as a problem.  I think, at this point, we want to see strong growth.  
We want to see a strong labor market.  We’ re not looking for a weaker labor market.  We’re 
looking for inflation to continue to come down, as it has been coming down for the last six 
months.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  And I ’m sorry .  If I could just follow up very quickly, the —when , 
when  you say that you want to make sure that it ’s a true signal, is there anything that you ’re 
seeing in the data that makes you doubt that it ’s a true signal at this stage? 
CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think it’s —I, I would say it, it seems —it seems to be the likely 
case that , that we will achieve that confidence, but we have to achieve it, and we haven ’t yet.  
And so—I mean, it ’s a good story.  We have six months of good inflation [readings] .  But you 
can—and you know this —you can look behind those numbers, and you can see that a lot of it ’s 
been coming from goods inflation, for example, and goods inflation running significantly negative.  It ’s a reasonable assumption that , over time , goods inflation will flatten out —probably 
approximate zero.  That would mean the services sectors would have to contribute more. So, in 
other words, what we care about is the aggregate number —not so much the composition.  But 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 27  
 we, we just need to see more.  That ’s where we are, as a Committee.  We need to see more 
evidence that sort of confirms what we think we ’re seeing and that tells us that we are on —gives 
us confidence that we ’re on, on a path to—a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos  of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, it seems to 
me you raised rates rapidly over the last two years for two reasons.  One was the risk of a wage–
price spiral.  Two, there were risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.  This 
morning ’s ECI report for the fourth quarter shows private -sector payroll growth running at a 
sub–4 percent pace.  Inflation expectations are very close to where they were before the inflation 
emergency of the last three years.  And , given that you appear to have substantially cut off these 
two tail risks and that you ’ve judged here today current policy as well into restrictive territory, 
what good reason is there to keep policy rates above 5 percent?   Are you really going to learn 
more waiting six weeks versus three months from now that you have avoided those two risks?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, as you know, almost every participant on the C ommittee does 
believe that it will be appropriate to reduce rates and  for, for —partly for the reasons that you say.  
You know, we, w e feel like inflation is coming down.  Growth has been strong.  The labor 
market is strong.  We’re —what we ’re trying to do is identify a place where we ’re really 
confident about inflation getting back down to 2 percent so that we can then begin the process of dialing back the restrictive level.  So, overall, I thi nk—I think  people do believe —and , as you 
know, the median participant wrote down three rate cuts this year.  But I think to get to that place where we feel comfortable starting the process, we need some confirmation that inflation is, in fact, coming down sustainably to 2 percent.  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 27  
 NICK TIMIRAOS.  If I could ask differently :  If, if you hold rates high as inflation 
moderates, as it —as it  has been, target rates will exceed the prescriptions of the Taylor rule or its 
variants .  What would be the reasoning for holding rates higher than the levels recommended by 
those rules in the current instance?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I—look, I think, as you know, we consult the range of Taylor 
rules and , and  non- Taylor kind of rules.  We consult them regularly.  They ’re in our , our 
Tealbook, and, and they ’re in all the materials that we look at.  But, you know, I don’ t think 
we’ve ever been at a— at a place where we were —where we were setting policy by them.  And 
there —depending on the rule, it will tell you different things.  There are many different 
formulations.  Another way to think about it is, implicitly, is—so, in theory, of course, real rates 
go up if —holding all else equal —as inflation comes down.  But that doesn ’t mean we can 
mechanically adjust policy as real rates—sorry —as inflation comes down.  It doesn ’t mean that 
at all , because, for one thing, we , we don’t know —we, we look at more than just the fed funds 
rate.  We look at —broadly—financial conditions. 
But, in addition, we don’ t know with great confidence where the neutral rate of interest is 
at any given time.  But that also doesn’ t mean that we wait around  for—to see, you know, the 
economy turn down, because that would be too late.  So we ’re really in a risk -management 
mode :  of managing the risk —as I mentioned in my opening remarks —managing the risk that we 
move too soon and move too late.  And I think to move, which is —which is where almost 
everyone on the C ommittee is —is in favor of , of moving rates down this year —but the timing of 
that is going to be linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 
2 percent.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard.

Page 8 of 27  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Hi.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  I ’d like you to, to  key in on the 
use of the word in, in the statement that inflation still “ remains elevated. ”  You’ve pledged to cut 
rates before inflation reached 2 percent.  So that implies that there ’s some sort of intermediate 
step here on , on inflation and that a , a cut would be consequent with a change in the statement 
language that inflation “remains elevated. ”  What ’s the step -down from there?  
CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I , I don’ t know that we ’ve worked out the particular s—
statement language and that kind of thing.  I would just say, if you look at —you know, look at 
where , where  12-month inflation is, and it’s, you know, it ’s still well above —core is 2.9 percent, 
for example —12- month —which is way down from where it was.  Very, very positive 
development —very fast decline—a nd, and, you know, the , the case is likely that it will continue 
to come down.  So , so that ’s where —that ’s where it is.  But  we’re , you know, we ’re wanting to 
see, you know, more data. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So , if I—if I could follow up on that, the statement allows 
that you want greater confidence on inflation falling before you cut, but it doesn’ t mention the 
other side of the mandate —a slide in employment.  Would a slide in employment also bring you 
to the point of , of cutting rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  So let me say that we’ re not looking for that.  That ’s not 
something we ’re looking for.  But , yes, if you think about, you know —in, in the base case, the 
economy is performing well —the labor market remains strong.  If we saw an unexpected 
weakening in, in—certainly in the labor market, that would certainly weigh on cutting sooner.   
Absolutely.  And if we saw inflation being stickier or higher or those sorts of things —would 
argue for moving later.  In the base case, though, where , where  the economy is healthy and we 
have, you know, we have ongoing growth—solid growth —we have a strong labor market —we 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL

 have inflation coming down—t hat’s what people are writing their SEP  [submissions] around.  
And in that case, what we ’re saying is, based on that, we think we can and should take advantage 
of that and, and be careful as we approach that question of when to begin to dial back restriction . 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire.  
CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   Just to circle back to the “ greater 
confidence ” aspect of the statement, there’ s been a lot of unanimity in recent meetings.  I ’m just 
wondering, going forward, when it comes to all needing greater confidence, is the re unanimity 
or, at least , consensus among FOMC members about what the threshold for that greater 
confidence is?  And if not, could you maybe tell us a little bit about the discussion today on, you 
know, what the variations between FOMC members was on what constitutes enough confidence to cut rates  and also if there was any variation on how quickly that “ greater confidence ” 
threshold could be reached?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So we’re not —we’re not really at that stage. You know, we’re —
we’re —there was no proposal to cut rates.  Some people did, you know, talk about their view of 
the rate path.  I would point you to the [December  2023] SEP as , as, you know, as  good evidence 
of where people are, although it is —it is  [now] one [FOMC meeting] cycle later.  So , you know, 
we’re not —we’re not  at a place of , of really working out those kinds of details, because we 
weren ’t actively considering, you know, a —moving, moving the federal funds rate down.  I will 
say, there is a—there is a  wide disparity —a healthy disparity —of views, and you see that in 
public , public  statements , in the minutes , and the transcripts when they’ re released every five 
years.  So  we do have a healthy set of differences, and I think that ’s actually essential for making 
good policy.  We’ re also able to reach agreement , generally , because we listen to each other —
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 27  
 we, we compromise .  And even though not everybody loves what we do, they’ re able to —for the 
most part— able to join in.  To me, that ’s a well -functioning public institution. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  So , over the past few years, there have been all these real -time 
indicators that helped us gain a sharper understanding of where the economy was, like 
OpenT able data or office attendance.  You ’ve talked about vacancies in the past.  And I ’m 
wondering, at the start of this year, what might be on that dashboard for you that ’s giving you the 
clearest picture of the economy —including on rents —if you could touch on that. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Including?  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Rent.  Rent costs.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  Well , so we’re not —you know, it ’s not the pandemic, so we 
can actually rely on more , more  traditional forms.  People are working.  T hey’re getting wages, 
and, and the economy has largely reopened and is broadly normalizing, as you see.  So I wouldn’ t say we ’re looking at that , that  sort of more innovative data as much.  You know, you 
point to rent s.  So, of course, we follow the , the components of inflation very carefully.  W hich 
would be :  Goods inflation—I talked about that a little bit ; you mentioned housing inflation.  So 
the question is, when will these lower market rents find their way into measured rents , as 
measured, measured in PCE inflation?  
And we think that ’s coming, and we know it ’s coming.  It ’s just a question of when and, 
and how big it ’ll be.  So —but  that’s in, in everyone ’s forecast, I would say. So that will —that 
will help.  But at the same time, we think goods inflation will probably— it’s been giving a lot of 
disinflation to the effort —and probably that declines over time, but it may well have some , some  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 27  
 more time to run.  You know, the se—the  supply chains are not perfectly back to where they 
were.   In addition, it takes time for the , the healing process to get into prices.  So  there may be 
still a tailwind.  We’ ll find out with, with  that.  So we look at the things that relate to our 
mandate very carefully , and—as you would imagine.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  I guess , just as a quick follow -up—do you feel comfortable at this 
point saying the economy has reached a soft landing, or is that part of looking for more 
confidence?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, I wouldn’ t—I wouldn’t  say we’ ve achieved that.  And I , I think 
we have —we have  a ways to go.  Inflation is still —you know, core inflation is still well above 
target on a 12- month basis.  Twelve months is our , our target, certainly.  I’m encouraged, and 
we’re encouraged by the progress.  But, you know, we ’re, we’re not —we’re not declaring 
victory at all at this point.  We think we have a ways to go.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You ’ve said that you would know the 
neutral rate by its works.  So I ’m wondering what you could tell me —how do you believe the 
neutral rate is working or telling you right now that growth is stronger?  In other words, how much is the economy really being restrained right now by the current funds rate?  And how much restraint does it really need, additionally, if inflation is still coming down?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s —I think you, you do see in the interest -sensitive parts of the 
economy— you do see, for example, housing.  You see the effects.  You do.  Your , your  second 
question, though, really, I think, is important, and that is , a lot of this has come through—a lot of 
the disinflationary process has come through the healing of supply chains and also of the labor market.  So you’ ve seen  the—you know, that other set of factors is really different from other 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 27  
 cycles and has brought that working with tighter , tighter  policy, which has enabled the supply 
side to recover —I think is that, that mixture has been behind what has enabled this.  So, no—we 
really do think that we ’re having an effect broadly across the economy.  I would point to the 
interest -sensitive parts of the economy as well as spending, generally.  But it ’s a—it’s a  joint 
story.  It ’s a complicated story.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  But , but how much restraint are you actually imparting to the 
economy, would you say, relative to the neutral rate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It’s —so I think it’s, it’s —of course , you know that it ’s not something 
you can identify with any precision.  But if you— a standard approach would be to take the 
nominal rate —5.3 percent, let ’s say —and subtract sort of a , a forward measure of inflation.  If 
you do that —and there are many, many ways to calculate th e neutral rate —but that ’s one I like 
to do.  And , you know, you’ re going to get to something that is materially above mainstream 
estimates of neutrality —of the neutral rate —you will.  And —but at the same time, you look at 
the economy, and you say, “T his is an economy that grew 3.1 percent last year. ”  And , and you 
say, “What does that tell you about the neutral rate? ”  What ’s happening, though, is , the supply 
side has been recovering in the middle of this.  So that , that  won ’t go on forever.  So a lot of the 
growth we ’re seeing  is not —is—it isn ’t just a tug of war between , between interest rates and 
demand.  You ’re getting , you know, more activity because of the —of labor market healing and 
supply chains healing.  So I think the question is, when that peters out, I think the , the, you 
know, the, the  restriction will show up probably more , more  sharply.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rich.  
RICH MILLER.  Thank you—sorry.  Thanks for taking the question, Mr. Chairman.  
You mentioned earlier we ’re not seeking a weaker labor market, I think you, you said.  Can you 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 27  
 talk a little bit more about that?  Do you—do you think the labor market now is back to quote, 
unquote, “ normal”  and that the —we can achieve the inflation target without wage gains coming 
back down to what they were pre -pandemic?  Even with today’ s ECI levels, they were still above 
those pre -pandemic levels.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I , I think the labor market by many measures is at or nearing 
normal —but not totally back to normal.  And you pointed to one or more of them.  So  I think, 
you know, job openings are not quite back to where they were.  Wages —wage  increases, rather, 
are not quite back to where they— to where they would need to be in the longer run.  I , I would 
look at it this way, though.  The , the economy is broadly normalizing, and so is the labor market.  
And that process will probably take some time.  So wage setting is something that happens —it’s, 
it’s—you know, probably will take a couple of years to get all the way back.  And that ’s okay.  
That’s okay.  But we do see —you saw today’ s ECI reading —you know, the evidence is that , that  
wage increases are still at a healthy level —very healthy level —but they’ re gradually moving 
back to levels that would be more associated —given, given assumptions about productivity, are 
more typically associated with 2 percent inflation.  It’s, it’s an ongoing process —a healthy one —
and, and, you know, I think we ’re, we’re  moving in the right direction.  
RICH MILLER.  So that process can continue without a weakening of the labor market, 
basically, you’ re saying?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think the , the labor market is —it— I don’t know if I’d —it’s 
rebalancing.  Clearly , that the —there was a fairly severe imbalance between demand for workers 
and supply at the beginning of the pandemic.  So we lost several million workers at the 
beginning of the pandemic from people dropping out of the labor force.  And then when the economy reopened—you remember 2021—you had a severe labor shortage , and it was just —it 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 27  
 was everywhere —panic on the part of businesses —couldn’ t, couldn’t  find people.  So , what ’s 
happened is —we expected labor —the labor supply—labor market to come back quickly, and it 
didn’ t.  And 2022 was a disappointing year, and, you know, we were kind of thinking, “Well, 
maybe we won’ t get it back. ”  And then 2023, we did, as you know —so labor force participation 
came back strongly in ’ 23, and so did immigration.  Immigration came to a halt during the 
pandemic.  
So—and so those two forces have significantly lowered the temperature in the labor 
market to what is still a very strong labor market.  It’ s still a good labor market for wages and for 
finding a job, but it ’s getting back into balance , and that ’s what we want to see.  And , you know, 
one great way to look at that is what ’s happening with, with  wage increases.  And you see it now 
across the, the  major things that we —that we  track.  It isn ’t every quarter, but , overall , there ’s a 
clear trend —still at high levels, but back down to where —what would be consistent with, with  
where  we were before the pandemic and with 2 percent inflation.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Thank you.  I 
wanted to follow up on Rich’ s question.  It sounded like you suggested that you’ re not worried 
about faster growth so much—s o wanted to see if you’ re seeing anything that suggests that 
inflation could reaccelerate from here .  And it sounds like you ’re saying you’ re not worried that 
solid growth from here on out poses any risk to inflation.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think that that is a risk —the risk that inflation would , would 
reaccelerate.  I think the , the greater risk is that it would —that it would  stabilize at a level 
meaningfully above 2 percent.  That ’s, that’s,  to me , more likely.  Of course, if —if inflation were 
to surprise by moving back up, that would—we would have to respond to that , and that would—
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 27  
 that would be a surprise at this point.  But I have to tell you, that ’s why we keep our options open 
here and why we ’re not , you know, rushing.  So I , I think both of those are risks, but I think the 
more likely risk is the one that I mentioned, which is , you’ ve had six good months —very good 
months —but what, what ’s really going to “ shake out ” here?  You know, where —what will—
when we look back, what will we see?  Will , will  inflation have dipped and then come back up?  
Are the last six months flattered by factors that are —that are  one-off factors that won ’t repeat 
themselves?  We don’ t think so.  We don’t —you know, that ’s not what we think, but that ’s the 
question we are asking .  We have to ask  [that], and we want to get comfort on that.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  And just one quick follow -up—Governor Waller had 
mentioned the revisions that are coming on February 9th for the CPI data.  Is that something 
you’re watching as well?  And if , if we see those revisions fairly minor, is that going to give you 
more confidence where things are going?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ ll just have to see.  Yeah.  We’ ll—we look at those.  Last year 
was a—was a, a surprise.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television.  If you don’ t 
want to use the term “ soft landing,”  would you say, at least , that, from your point of view now, 
the other scenario of a hard landing caused by the F ed is off the table or the risks have 
diminished very much?  And you mentioned below –2 percent inflation for —on a three -month 
basis, core PCE has been running at 1 ½ percent.  And there are those on Wall Street who think 
that if you maintain the level of restriction you have right now, you could end up with inflation running below your target.  How do you see that?  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So , how to—your first question—how to describe where we are?   So 
I guess I would just say this —executive summary would be that growth is solid to strong over 
the course of last year.  The labor market —3.7 percent unemployment indicates that the labor 
market is strong.  We’ ve had just about two years now of , of unemployment under 4 percent.  
That hasn ’t happened in 50 years.  So it ’s a good labor market.  And we ’ve seen inflation come 
down.  We’ ve talked about that.  So  we’ve got six months of good inflation data and an 
expectati on that there ’s more to come.  So this is a —this is a  good situation.  Let ’s be honest.  
This is a— this is a good economy.  
But what ’s the outlook?   That ’s looking in the re arview —the outlook—we do expect 
growth to moderate.  Of course, we have expected it for some time, and it hasn’ t happened, but 
we do expect that it will moderate as supply chain and labor market normalization runs its 
course.  The l abor market is rebalancing , as, as I mentioned .  Job creation has slowed.  The base 
of job growth has narrowed.  And , of course, 12- month inflation is, is above target and getting, 
you know, getting down closer to target.  It ’s not guaranteed, but we do seem to be getting on 
track for that.   So those are the risks and , and questions we have to answer.  But , overall, this is a 
pretty good picture.  It, it is a good picture.  Your second question was —sorry.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Could you get inflation that is below target —end up with inflation 
below target , and you have to do something about that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we —the thing is, we ’re not looking for inflation to tap the 
2 percent base once.  We ’re looking for it to settle out over time at 2 percent.  And the same 
thing is true  if we have a month or two of lower —and we have that now —of, of inflation that ’s 
annualized at a —at a lower level—that wouldn’ t be good.  We’ re not —you know, we’re not  
looking to have inflation anchor below 2 percent.  We’ re looking to have it anchor at 2  percent.  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 27  
 So if we do face those circumstances, then we’ ll have to deal with that.  I think —I think as of 
now, you know, the , the question, which—we want to take advantage of this situation and finish 
the job on inflation while keeping the labor market strong.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence from Fox Business.  Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman, for taking this.  So , as I ’ve—as I’ve  heard from some District F ed presidents, is 
it, in your view , a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?   And then 
when we do see that first rate cut, is that —should we interpret that as the beginning of a rate -cut 
cycle, or is it a one -off? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I ’ll point you to that language on your first question.  We, we  
included that language in the statement to signal clearly that —with strong growth, strong labor 
market, inflation coming down —the C ommittee intends to move carefully as we consider when 
to begin to dial back the restrictive stance that we have in place.  So if you take that to the current 
context —current context, we’re going to be data  dependent.  We’re going to be looking at this 
meeting by meeting.  Based on the meeting toda y, I would tell you that I don’ t think it’ s likely 
that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify 
March as the time to do that.  But that’ s, that’s  to be seen.  So I wouldn’ t call —you know, when 
you say —when you ask me about “ in the near term, ” I’m hearing that as March.  I would say I 
don’t think that’s —that’s, that’s  probably not the most likely case or what we would call the base 
case.  And your second question is — 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  On, on the —is this the start of a —when we see a cut, is it the 
start of a cutting cycle , or is it —could it just be a one -off? 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  You know, that ’s going to depend on the data.  The whole thing is, 
this is going to depend on the data.  We’re going to be looking at the economic data as it affects 
the outlook and the balance of risks.  And we ’re going to make our decisions based on that.  And 
it could wind up—you know, we ’ll, we’ll have another SEP at the March meeting , and, and 
people will write down what they think.  But , in the end, it ’s really going to depend on how the 
economy evolves.  We talked about, there are risks that would cause us to go slower —for 
example, stronger inflation—more , more  persistent inflation.  There are risks that  would cause us  
to—if they happen—that would cause us to go faster or —and sooner.  And that would be a 
weakening in the labor market or , for that matter, very, very persuasive lower inflation.  Those 
are the kinds of things.  So we ’re just —we’re just  going to be reacting to the data.  That ’s the—
that’s re ally the only way we can do this.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.  Could you talk a little bit more 
about productivity growth?  You know, you’ ve mentioned multiple times about, you know, the 
level of wage growth that’ s consistent with 2 percent inflation.  We’ ve obviously seen, you 
know —you were talking about ECI this morning,  in which it ’s cooled a little bit but still sort of 
above what you wanted to see.  Growth has been very strong.  How much of those numbers do 
you attribute to productivity?  And do you see that productivity as sort of just temporary because of the factors—the labor and supply chain factors you were talking about —or do you think that 
productivity growth will , will fade over time?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So this is a really interesting question.  And I think— my, my own 
view is —I think if you look, look back to the pandemic, you , you saw a spike in productivity as 
workers were laid off , and , and activity didn’ t decline as fast.  And then you saw a deep trough 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 27  
 of productivity.  And then, over the last —you saw high productivity last year , in ’23.  I think 
we’re, we’re  basically in the throes of getting through the pandemic economy.  And the question 
will be, what, what is it that has changed the—you know, the productivity tends to be based on, 
you know, fundamental aspects of our economy.  Is there —is there a case—will it be the case 
that we come out of this more productive on a sustained basis?  And I don’ t know.  I don’t know.  
What would it take?  It would take —you know, people talk about AI, but I would— my guess is 
that we may shake out and be back where we were, because I don’t —I’m not sure I see—work 
from home doesn’ t seem like it ’s a big productivity increase .  Or AI, artificial intelligence —
generative  it may  be, but probably not in the short run—probably, maybe in the longer run.  So 
I’m not —I’m not seeing why it would, but , you know, right —you know, right now I would say 
that productivity is kind of what falls out of the , the broader forces that are driving people in and 
out of the labor force and , and activity returning and supply chains getting fixed.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Right.  So would that be behind why we ’ve seen such strong 
growth, but we ’ve also seen inflation fall —that maybe there ’s just a higher level of productivity?  
CHAIR POWELL.  That ’s one way to look at it.  Yeah.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy.  NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with 
Marketplace.  I want to ask a little bit more about housing.  I ’m wondering—how closely are you 
watching rent and housing prices as you evaluate whether and when to cut rates?  And it seems like housing prices are not coming down as quickly as you expected.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So when we think about, you know —our , our statutory goals are 
maximum employment and price stability, and that ’s what we ’re targeting.  We’ re not targeting 
housing price inflation, the cost of housing, or any of those things.  Those are very important 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 27  
 things for people ’s lives.  But they’re not —you know, those are not the things we ’re targeting.  
We’re also well aware that when we cut rates at the beginning of the pandemic, for example, the 
housing, housing industry was helped more than any other industry.  And when we raise rates, 
the housing industry can be hurt , because it ’s a very interest -sensitive sector.  
On top of that, we have longer -run problems with the availability of housing.  You know, 
we have a, a  built -up set of cities , and, and, you know, people are moving further and further out.  
So there ’s—there hasn ’t been enough housing built.  And these are not —these are not  things that 
we have any tools to address.  But , you know, where it comes into play very specifically in our 
work is inflation, which is a combination.  It ’s, it’s really rental inflation.  You’re taking owners ’ 
equivalent rent and then ac tual rent paid by tenants.  And you’ re, you’re  running that through the 
CPI calculation .  Or the PCE [inflation] calculation —the one we look at.  And what that ’s telling 
you is that market rents are increasing at a much lower rate or even being flat and that that will 
show up in inflation over time.  It has to as long as that remains the case.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   And just real quick—what is your response to the 
letter that was sent to you by some members of Congress asking the F ed to lower interest rates to 
make housing more affordable?  
CHAIR POWELL.  My response is what I started with, which is that our , our job—the 
job Congress has given us is price stability and maximum employment.  Price stability is 
absolutely essential for people ’s lives, m ost importantly for —well, not most importantly— most, 
mostly for people at the lower end of the income spectrum who are living at the edges —at the 
margins.  And so someone —for someone like that, high inflation in the —in the  necessities of 
life—right away , you’ re in trouble, whereas even middle -class  people have  some , you know, 
some scope to absorb higher costs.  So we have to get —it’s our job.  It’s what society has asked 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 27  
 us to do, is to get inflation down , and t he tools that we use to do it are interest rates.  So that ’s 
how we think about that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Court enay. 
COURTENAY BROWN.  Court enay Brown from Axios.  Can you give us some insight 
into whether the C ommittee discussed the possibility of slowing balance sheet runoff in the 
months ahead?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Yes.  So I would start by saying that balance sheet runoff so far has 
gone very well.  And as the process has continued, you know, we ’re getting to that time where 
questions are beginning to come into greater focus about the pace of runoff and all that.  So at 
this meeting, we did have some discussion of the balance sheet, and we ’re planning to begin in -
depth discussions of balance sheet issues at our next meeting in March.  So those , those  
questions are all coming into scope now, and we ’re focusing on them.  But we ’re, we’re  at the 
beginning of that process, I would say. 
COURTENAY BROWN.  Quick follow -up—i s it the case that the F ed would decide to 
lower rates and make adjustments to the balance sheet runoff in tandem?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Yes, we  do—we see those as independent tools.  And so  they 
don’t —for example, if you ’re—if you’re  normalizing policy, you might be reducing rates but 
continuing to run off the balance sheet.  In both cases, that ’s normalization, but from a strict 
monetary policy standpoint, you could say we ’re loosening along with tightening.  So that , that  
could happen.  It’ s not something we ’re planning or thinking about , but right now, we ’re 
thinking about getting to a place where —we ’re going to see the balance sheet runoff to continue.  
We’re watching it carefully, and, as I said, we’ ll—we’ll be  looking into that as a C ommittee 
starting in March.  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL

 COURTENAY BROWN.  Thanks. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he Economist.  Thank you, Chair 
Powell.  You ’ve mentioned six good months of inflation data, but that not being enough to build 
up confidence.  Based on your previous response that your base case is you probably wouldn’ t 
start easing yet in March, the implication is that eight good months might not be enough, either.   
Roughly how many months do you think you might need of , of good inflation  data to be —to be  
confident?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m, I’m not in a position to put a number on it.  I ’m just going to 
say—and it ’s not that we don’ t have any confidence.  We, we  have growing confidence, but not 
to the point where we —where we  feel like —it’s a highly consequential decision to start the 
process of , of dialing back on restriction.  And w e want to get that right, and we feel like the 
strong economy, strong labor market, inflation coming down—it gives us the ability to do that.  
We think that ’s the best way we can serve the public, because , ultimately, we, we ’ve made a lot 
of progress on inflation.  We just want to make sure that we do get the job done in a sustainable 
way.  That ’s how we ’re thinking about it.  In terms of when that ’ll be, you know, that, that ’ll all 
come out of our communications, and , you know, we won’t —we won ’t keep that a secret.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Evan . 
EVAN RYSER.   Hi, Chair Powell .  Evan R yser with MNI Market News.  Can you 
explain a little bit more on what you’ re considering when tapering QT?  Do you need to see the 
overnight reverse repo facility all the way down to zero, or is it something that you can start with a couple hundred billion dollars there?

 CHAIR POWELL.  Not a decision that we ’ve made, but I , I wouldn’ t think we ’d, we’d  
be—we wouldn’t be taking a position that it ’s got to go to zero.  I mean, if it—if it  were to 
stabilize at a different level—but that ’s, that’s  not a decision that we ’ve made.  That ’s, that’s  
what we ’ll be talking about at the March meeting.  A whole range of issues will be briefed up, 
and the C ommittee will get into —get into  all of the issues that will be arising over the course of 
the next, let ’s say, year or so.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg . 
GREG ROBB.  Thanks.  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.  Chair Powell, I want to change 
gears a little bit.  In the presidential primary campaign that’ s been going on for the last nine 
months or so, your name has come up often, and many Republican candidates ha d said that they 
probably wouldn’ t want to give you a third term.  So I wanted to give you a chance to talk about 
that.  Do you want another term —you’ve had— on the F ed?  What , what ’s your stance on that?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I don’ t have a stance on that.  It’ s not something I’ m focused on.  
[We’re] focused on doing our jobs.  We have—t his year is going to be a highly consequential 
year for , for the F ed and for monetary policy.  A nd we ’re, all of us , very buckled down, focused 
on doing our jobs.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  As you mentioned, core PCE  [inflation] has been running at 1.9 percent over 
the past six months .  And you guys are actually expecting core inflation higher this year , at 2.4 
percent , compared to that six -month measure.  Given that forecast and that the median is for 
three rate cuts this year, what happens if inflation stays where it ’s been over the last six months 
for the next six months?  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So I —you know, we’re going to do—w e’ll update our , our inflation 
forecasts at the next meeting.  You referred to the December meeting.  That ’s, that’s, you know, 
three months old  [by March] , so it might be lower now , given the data we ’ve gotten.  So , look, as 
I mentioned, we ’re going to be reacting to the data.  If, if  we get —if we get  very strong inflation 
data and it , it kicks back up, then it’ll—then we ’ll go slower or later or both.  If we got really 
good inflation data soon, that would matter for both the —that, that would  tell us that, that  we 
could go sooner and perhaps go faster.  So we’re just going to be —but , of course, we ’ll weigh 
that with all the other factors.  We ’re setting policy based on the totality of , of the data.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.   But just to follow —if inflation stays where it is currently, 
that would probably mean that the real interest rate becomes more restrictive.  Would that mean 
you’d have to trim more, perhaps, than you already have factored in?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Well, I think if we —if we  came to the view that , that inflation 
were —that the six -month inflation numbers, which are very close to 2 [percent] , were , in “ PCE 
world ”—if we came to —if that’s —if we thought that is really where we ’re going to be, then, 
yes, our policy would be in a different place.  It would.  But , you know, that ’s the whole point is , 
we’re trying to get comfortable and gain confidence that that is where —that inflation is on a 
sustainable path down to 2 percent or toward 2 percent.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Daniel.  
DANIEL AVIS.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Daniel Avis, Agence France- Presse.  I just wondered 
if I could get your comment on the recent consumer confidence data.  It seems to suggest that 
consumers are sort of moving towards a much more optimistic view of the economy.  I just 
wonder —is it fair to say that they ’re moving towards where the Fed appears to have been in 
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 27  
 recent months?  And , you know, do you think that inflation and falling inflation perhaps has 
played a role in that?  And what challenges do you see , going forward?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so it ’s been —it’s been  interesting that confidence surveys 
have been weak , at a time when unemployment has been low —very low, historically low —for a 
couple of years.  And —but , nonetheless, that ’s been the case.  And we ’ve asked ourselves why 
that is.  And , you know, one obvious answer —we don’ t pretend to have perfect wisdom on 
this—is—but one obvious answer is that the price level  is high.  So  prices went up much more 
than 2 percent for year —per year for a couple of years.  And people are going to the store, and 
they’ re paying much more for the basics of life than they were two years ago—three years ago.  
And they’ re not happy about it.  And it ’s fine that inflation is coming down, but the price —the 
prices they ’re paying are still high.  
So that , that is what —that, that has to be some part of why people are unhappy.  And 
they’ re, they’re  right to be unhappy.  You know, t his is why we need to keep price stability.  It ’s 
why we need to do our jobs —so that people don’ t have to deal with things like this.  
In terms of [surveys] —you’re right.  In, in recent , recent  surveys, a couple of —you’ ve 
seen a couple of significant increases in , in consumer confidence or , or happiness with the 
economy.  I guess that ’s a good thing.  That can —that can  support spending—can support 
economic activity.  There ’s some evidence of that.   But it is —it is  a fact that we have seen , you 
know, a meaningful increase.   I think levels of confidence are still maybe not as high as they’ ve 
been at various times.  But it’s —they certainly have come up.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Bryan . 
BRYAN MENA.  Thank you for taking our questions.  B ryan Mena , CNN Business.  
Committee members have said they ’d like to meet with business leaders and stakeholders in

Page 26 of 27  
 person to learn more about the economy in real time, given that some data is subject to large 
revisions, the issue of seasonal adjustments being thrown off balance, and many readings of the economy being quarterly.  So did any members say they’ ve learned anything not reflected in the 
data?  Or have you yourself learned anything through anecdotal evidence that hasn’ t been 
captured in the data yet?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, yes.  I’m, I’m a big believer that— yes.  So we , we do meet 
with outside groups who come from all different parts of the economy.  And I always feel like 
you—I mean, I spent most of my life in the private sector looking at companies —individual 
companies —individual management teams —and then building out from that. And so,  starting 
with GDP data is —and working into what ’s actually affecting people ’s lives is—is  challenging.  
It’s very hard.  So I , I really like anecdotal data.   In addition, as you know, the 12 R eserve B anks 
have really the best network of anyone.  In all their D istricts, they ’re talking to , you know, not 
just the business community, but the educational, medical, all, all—you know, nonprofit 
community.   They have arms into all of that.  And so when they come back —that ’s what goes 
into the Beige Book.  But they come back, and what each R eserve B ank president does is, during 
the outlook go- around, they ’ll say, “I n my D istrict  . . .”   And they’ ll talk about 100 conversations  
they—not —they won’t talk—t hey, they will give you input , based on 100 conversations that 
they’ ve had with people of all different walks.  And it’s —I personally find it very helpful in 
understanding what ’s going on.  And also, I think you hear things before they show up in the 
data sometimes.  
BRYAN MENA.   Did any of them —did any of them  notice slowing economy based on 
what they’ ve heard from, like, their D istrict?  
January 31, 2024   Chair Powell ’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.   Yes.  I mean, if you—if you look back at the last —not this Beige 
Book, but the one before , it was more —there was a lot of “ slower activity. ”  I think that , that  
what you’ re hearing now is , is, things are picking up a bit.  You’re hearing —not , not in every 
District and not every , every person that we talk to, but  you’re —overall, it feels like you ’re 
hearing things picking up at the margin.  So that ’s what comes through.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Let’s go to Jeff Cox for the last question. 
JEFF COX.   Thank you, sir.  Jeff Cox from CNBC.com.  Just kind of looking to put it all 
together :  You talked about basically the , the economy looking strong with 3.3 percent 
annualized growth in the fourth quarter.  Does the strength of the economy speak more loudly to 
you now than any inflation threat might?  That, you know —you’ re in a position, in other words, 
to keep rates elevated as long as the economy stays strong, and you’ re more —you’ re more  tilted 
towards that.  And also, perhaps, are you worried at all that the economy is maybe a little too 
strong right now and that inflation could come back at some point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m not so worried about that.  You know, it’s —again, we ’ve had 
inflation come down without a slow economy and without , you know, important increases in , in 
unemployment, and there ’s no reason why we should want to get in the way of that process , if 
it’s going to continue.  So I , I am —you know, I  think—I think  declining inflation —continued 
declines in inflation  are, are really the main thing we ’re looking at.  Of course, we want the labor 
market to remain strong, too.  
We don’ t have a growth mandate.  We ’ve got a , a maximum -employment mandate and a , 
a price -stability mandate, and those are the two things we look at.  Growth only matters to the 
extent it influences our achievement of those two—of those two mandates.  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference  
March 20 , 2024  
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  
The economy has made considerable  progress toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has 
eased substantially  while the labor market has remained strong , and that  is very good news.  But 
inflation is still too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path 
forward is uncertain.  We are fully committed to returning inflation to  our 2  percent goal.  
Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefit s all. 
Today, the  FOMC  decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to 
reduce our securities holdings.  Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been putting 
downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.   As labor market tightness has eased and 
progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals 
are moving into better balance .  I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly 
reviewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid  pace.  
GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent.  For 2023 as a whole, GDP 
expanded 3.1 percent , bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supply 
conditions.  Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year , largely reflecting high 
mortgage rates.  High interest rates also appear to have weigh ed on business fixed investment.  In 
our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth  to 
slow  from last year’s pace , with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent over 
the next two years.  Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December, 
reflecting the strength of incoming data, including data on labor supply.  
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 24 
 The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions continue to 
come into better balance.  Over the past three months, payroll job gains averaged 265,000 jobs 
per month.  The unemployment rate  has edged up but  remains low at 3.9 percent.  Strong job 
creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers , reflecting increases in 
participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.  
Nominal wage growth  has been easing, and job v acancies have declined.  Although the jobs -to-
workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers.   FOMC 
participants expect the rebalancing in the labor market to continue, easing upward pressure on 
inflation.   The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this 
year and 4.1 percent at the end of next year.   
Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer -run goal of 
2 percent.  Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total PCE 
prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February and that, excluding the volatile 
food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.   Longer -term inflation 
expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of 
households, businesses, and forecasters as well as  from  measures from financial markets.   The 
median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation falls to 2.4 percent  this year , 2.2 percent 
next year,  and 2 percent in 2026.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes purchasing power, espe cially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We 
are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.  
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 24 
 The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities 
holdings.  As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks 
to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.  We believe that 
our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle  and that, if the economy evolves 
broadly as expected, it will likel y be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some 
point  this year.  The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to 
inflation risks.  We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for 
longer, if appropriate.  
We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of 
the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation 
back to 2 percent.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too  late or too little could unduly 
weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range 
for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving 
outlook, and the balance of risks.  Th e Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce 
the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably  down  
toward 2 percent.  Of course, we’re committed to both sides of our dual mandate , and  an 
unexpected weakening in the labor market could also warrant a policy response.   We will 
continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.  
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate based on what each participant judges to be the most 
likely scenario going forward.   If the economy evolves as projected, the median participant 
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 percent at the end of this 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 24 
 year, 3.9 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026 , still above the medium —
median longer -term funds rate.  These projections are not a Committee decision or plan; if the 
economy does not evolve as projected, the path for policy will adjust as appropriate to foster our 
maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Turning to our balance sheet, our securities holdings have declined by nearly $1.5  trillion 
since the Committee  began reducing our portfolio .  At this meeting, we discussed issues related 
to slowing the pace of decline in our securities holdings.  While we did not make any decisions  
today on this , the general sense of the Committee is that it will be appropriate to slow the pace of 
runoff fairly soon , consistent with the plans we previously issued.   The decision to slow the pace 
of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less  than it would 
otherwise  but rather allows us to approach that ultimate level more gradually.  In particular, 
slowing the pace of runoff will help ensure a smooth transition , reducing the possibility that 
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities 
holdings  consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves . 
We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to 
keeping our longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability is 
essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and price stability  over the long 
term. 
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We , at the 
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.

 STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.   Mr. Chairman, the projections show 
somewhat higher core inflation .  They also show somewhat stronger growth.  What should we 
infer from this notion that, on average , rates were kept the same this year , but inflation is higher 
and growth is higher.  Does it mean more tolerance for higher inflation and less of a willingness 
to slow the economy to achieve that target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, it doesn ’t—no, it doesn ’t mean that.  What it means is that , you 
know,  we’ve seen incoming —as I pointed out in my opening remarks, we did mark  up our 
growth forecast and so have many other forecasters, so the economy is performing , performing  
well.  And the inflation data came in a little bit higher is a separate matter , and I think that caused 
people to write up their inflation .  But nonetheless, we continue to make good progress on 
bringing inflation down .  And so — 
STEVE LIESMAN.  When you —just to follow  up:  When you say that you ’re willing to 
either maintain the rate for longer, is —what is the tolerance of the Federal Reserve for inflation 
coming in above its 2 percent target?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’re strongly committed to bringing inflation down to 2 percent 
over time.  That is —that is our goal , and we will achieve that goal.  Markets believe we will 
achieve that goal .  And they should believe that, because that ’s what —that’s what will happen 
over time.  But we stress “over time. ”  And so I think we ’re, we’re  making projections that do 
show that happening .  And we ’re committed to that outcome , and we will bring it about.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.   Thanks 
for taking our questions.  You and other s have been saying that relief on housing inflation is 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 24 
 coming, but it still hasn ’t shown up meaningfully in the CPI or the PCE.  Does that challenge 
your assumption about when the shift will finally break through , since it hasn ’t at that point ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think there ’s some confidence that the market rents —lower 
market rent increases that we ’re seeing will show up in measures of housing services inflation 
over time.  There ’s a little bit of uncertainty about when that will happen , but there ’s real 
confidence that they will show up eventually over time.  But, again, uncertainty about the exact 
timing of that . 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Okay.   And will you be able to get overall inflation down to target if 
housing doesn ’t break through quickly, and does that affect the timing for eventual cuts this 
year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We will get aggregate inflation down to 2 percent over time.  We 
will.  And, and  I would assume that we ’ll continue to see is —we’ll see goods prices coming into 
a new equilibrium where they ’re going down  perhaps not as quickly as they had been earlier this 
year, where housing services inflation will come back down as , as current market rents are 
suggesting will happen and where nonhousing services will move back down.  Some 
combination of those three things —and it may be different from the combination we had before 
the pandemic —will be achieved and will bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, during your 
congressional testimony this month, you said that your test for making the first change to interest 
rates does not require you to be terribly comfortable that inflation is at 2 percent because interest 
rates are well  above neutral.  At the same time, you said here after the last meeting that the first 
cut is highly consequential.  Can you reconcile these views for me?   If rates are well  above 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 24 
 neutral, why would the first cut be highly consequential?  Is that because you anticipate one cut 
would be followed by one or two more along the lines of the recalibration you made in 2019, 
which itself was modeled on the mid -cycle adjustment of 1995?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It’s more —I would put it more in the context of what I said in our —
in my opening remarks that the risks are really two -sided here .  We—we’re in a situation where , 
you know, if we ease —if we ease  too much or too soon, we could see inflation come back, and if 
we ease too late, we could do unnecessary harm to employment and people ’s working lives.  And 
so, you know, we do see the risks as two -sided, so it is consequential .  We want to be careful .  
And, fortunately , with the economy growing, with the labor market strong, and with inflation 
coming down, we can approach that question carefully and let the data speak on that.  That’s 
really what I was thinking.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  How much of that inflation that we ’ve seen so far this year do you 
chalk up to one -off calendar adjustment effects following a period of high inflation versus some 
change in the trend we saw  in the second half of last year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I want to start by being —saying I always try to be careful about 
dismissing data that we don ’t like.   So you need to check yourself on that , and I ’ll do that .  But—
so I would say the January number, which was very high —the January CPI and PCE numbers 
were quite high .  There’s reason to think that there could be seasonal effects there.  But, 
nonetheless, we don ’t want to be completely dismissive of it.  The February number was high, 
higher than expectations, but we have it at currently well below 30 basis points core PCE, which 
is not terribly high.  So it’s not like the January number.   But I take the two of them together , and 
I think they haven ’t really changed the overall story , which is that of inflation moving down 
gradually on a sometimes -bumpy road toward  2 percent.   I don ’t think that story has changed.  I 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 24 
 also don ’t think that those readings added to anyone ’s confidence that we ’re moving closer to , to 
that point .  But, you know,  we didn ’t—the last thing I ’ll say is we didn ’t excessively celebrate 
the good inflation readings we got in the last seven months of last year.  We didn ’t take too much 
signal out of that .  What you heard us saying was that we needed to see more that we could , you 
know —we wanted to be careful about that decision , and we ’re not going to overreact , as well , to 
these two months of data, nor are we going to ignore them.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Ann.  
ANN SAPHIR.  Hi, yes , Chair Powell.   Could you speak a little bit more about the 
timing?  Is there enough data between now and , say, May to be able to get the kind of confidence 
that you say you still need ?  Or, by June , is there enough data for you?   Just give us a sense of 
your thinking there.  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  So we make decisions meeting by meeting .  And we didn ’t 
make any decisions about future meetings today.   Those are going to depend on our ongoing 
assessment of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  So I really don ’t 
have anything for you on any specific meeting , looking forward.  
ANN SAPHIR.   I mean just a question of —I mean , is there even enough data for you to 
be able to — 
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ll take —you know, things can happen during an inter meeting 
period , if you look back —unexpected things.  So I don ’t want to —I wouldn ’t want to dismiss 
anything.   So I just would say that the Committee wants to see more data that gives us higher 
confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.  I also mentioned —and 
we don ’t see this in the data right now, but if there were a significant weakening in the data, 
particularly in the labor market, that could also be a reason for us to begin the process of 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 24 
 reducing rates .  Again, I don ’t—there ’s nothing in the data pointing at that , but those are the 
things that we ’ll be looking at , at coming meetings and —without trying to refer to any specific 
meeting.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRIS TOPHER  RUGABER.  Hi, Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press.  Thank you.  In 
the projections , there is an increase in the neutral rate , as you know, and higher rates —¼ point 
higher rates projected in 2025, 2026.   Can you speak about why, [ what ] might be behind that?  Is 
there a real sense here that the economy has perhaps changed in some way that higher rates will 
be needed in the future?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So you ’re right.  They ’re pretty modes t changes , but you ’re right .  
There was an uptick in the longer -run rate, and also there ’s a 25 basis point increase in  ’25 and  
’26.  In terms of , are rates going to be higher in the longer run, if that ’s really your question, I 
don’t think we know that.  I think it ’s, it’s—we think that rates were generally low during the 
pre-pandemic post –Global Financial Crisis era for reasons that are mostly , you know,  important, 
slow -moving , large things like demographics and productivity and that sort of thing —things that 
don’t move quickly.  But I don ’t think we know.  I mean , my instinct would be that rates will not 
go back down to the very low levels that we saw , where , all around the world , there were long -
run [real interest] rates that were at or below zero in some cases.  I don ’t see rates going back 
down to that level .  But I think there ’s tremendous uncertainty around that.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Great, and just a quick follow [-up].  On the projections , you also 
have 2. 6 percent core inflation for the end of this year.  It’s already at —or you mentioned it 
being 2.8 in February .  I mean , that doesn ’t sound like much disinflation at all.   So are you really , 
are you still confident or —at the last press conference , you sounded pretty optimistic [that] you 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 24 
 would get more confidence at the end of this year.  Is it right to say that this suggests you ’re not 
seeing a lot of disinflation this year compared to what we ’ve seen 2023 and so forth?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think that that higher year -end number reflects the data we ’ve seen 
so far this year  because you ’re now —you’re now in this year .  So I think that —sorry, say your 
last part of your question again.  
CHRIS RUGABER.   Are you still optimistic that you ’ll get the confidence you need this 
year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I, you know , I think , if you look at the SEP, what it says is that it is 
still likely in most people ’s view that we will achieve that confidence and that there will be rate 
cuts.  But that ’s really going to depend on the incoming data .  It is.  The other thing is, in the 
second half of the year , you have some pretty low readings , so it might be harder to make 
progress as you move that 12 -month window forward.  Nonetheless, we ’re looking for data that 
confirm the kind of low readings that we had last year and give us a higher degree of confidence 
that what we saw was really inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent —toward 2 percent.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times.   Thank you for taking our 
questions.   Per your comment to Ann that a weakening in the labor market would be a reason to 
potentially cut rates or at least a consideration in making a rate cut, would continued strength in 
the labor market be a reason to hold off on rate cuts ?  And just in general, if labor supply 
continued to rebound in 2024, the way it did in 2023, what would stronger hiring and possibly 
stronger growth mean for the path forward on policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  So, so, if what we ’re getting is a lot of supply and a lot of 
demand , and that supply is actually feeding demand because workers are getting paid and they ’re 
spending and that ’s, you know —what you would have is potentially kind of what you had last 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11 of 24 
 year, which is a bigger economy where inflationary pressures are not increasing.  In fact, they 
were decreasing .  So you can have that if you have a continued supply -side activity that we had 
last year with —both with supply ch ains and also with , with growth in the size of the labor force.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  But—so strong hiring in and of itself would not be a reason to 
hold off on rate cuts?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, not all by itself .  No .  I mean , we saw —you saw last year very 
strong hiring and inflation coming down quickly.  We now have a better sense that a big part of 
that was supply -side healing, particularly with , with growth in the labor force.   So, in and of 
itself, strong job growth is not a reason , you know,  for us to be concerned about inflation.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Neil Irwin with Axios.  How do you assess the state of 
financial conditions right now , and particularly —in particular , do you view the kind of easing  in 
financial conditions since the fall as consistent and compatible with what you ’re trying to 
achieve on the inflation mandate?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we think —there are many different financial conditions 
indicators , and you can kind of , you know,  see different answers to that question.  But, 
ultimately, we do think that financial conditions are weighing on economic activity , and we think 
you see that in —a great place to see it is in the labor market , where you ’ve seen demand cooling 
off a little bit from the extremely high levels .  And there I would point to job openings, quits, 
surveys, the hiring rate .  Things like that are really demand.  There are also supply -side things 
happening, but I think those are demand -side things happening.  You know, w e saw—that’s been 
a question for a while .  We did see progress on inflation last year —significant progress , despite 
financial conditions sometimes being tighter, sometimes looser.  
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 24 
 MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television.  Can you 
give us more color on how the Committee is thinking about inflation dynamics now?  What 
we’ve seen at the beginning of the year, are they more one -off increases that will fade , or is there 
more of a secular turn with goods prices rising again and service prices staying sticky ?  And also 
housing prices have been sort of the  Godot of this cycle , in that you keep expecting them to go 
down , and they don ’t.  How does the Committee see this playing out forward, since you ’ve 
raised your inflation forecast?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I see the Committee looking at the two months of data and asking 
the same question you ’re asking and saying we ’re just going to have to see what the data show.  
As I mentioned, you can look at January, which is a very high reading and you can —and I think 
many people did see the possibility of seasonal adjustment problems there .  But, again, you don ’t 
want to —you’ve got to be careful about dismissing the parts of the data that you don ’t like.  So 
then February wasn ’t, wasn’t  as high, but it was higher.   So the question is, what are we going to 
see?  You know, w e tend to see a little bit stronger —this is in the data —a little bit stronger 
inflation in the first half of the year, a little bit less strong later in the year.   We’re going to —
we’re going to let the data show.   I don’t think we really know whether this is a bump on the 
road or something more.  We’ll have to find out.  In the meantime, the economy is strong , the 
labor market is strong , inflation has come way down, and that gives us the ability to approach 
this question carefully and feel more confident that inflation is moving down sustainably at 
2 percent when we take that step to begin dialing back our restrictive policy.  
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 24 
 MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well , you’ve talked about the desire to have confidence that 
inflation is continually moving down.  Have the recent numbers we ’ve gotten for inflation data 
dented that confidence at all?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It certainly hasn ’t improved our confidence —it hasn’t  raised 
anyone ’s confidence .  But I would say that the story is really essentially the same and that is of 
inflation coming down gradually toward 2 percent on a sometimes -bumpy path, as I mentioned.   
I think that ’s what you still see.  We’ve got nine months of 2 ½ percent inflation now , and we ’ve 
had two months of kind of bumpy inflation.  We were saying that we ’ll—it’s going to be a 
bumpy ride.  We consistently said that.  Now here are some bumps , and the question is , are they 
more than bumps?  And we just don ’t—we can ’t know that.  That’s why we are approaching this 
question carefully .  It is very important for everyone that we serve that we do get inflation 
sustainably down .  And I think the historical record, it ’s—every situation is different , but the 
historical record is that you need to approach that question carefully and try to get it right the 
first time and not have to come back and raise rates again perhaps if you cut inappropriately —
prematurely.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Go to Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence with FOX 
Business.  I wanted to ask you, you received a letter from —well, the Federal Reserve is an 
independent body , understanding Congress has oversight over that.   You received a letter from 
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse that said —calling on you to lower interest 
rates —to cut interest rates because this has “the potential that it  may remain too high for too 
long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant 
climate and economic benefits from these projects. ”  So has higher interest rates caused that?  
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 24 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Have they —well, first of all, I respect our —you know, in our system 
of government , it is Congress that has oversight responsibility over the Fed.  We place a 
tremendous amount of importance on our engagements with Congress and always treat them 
with great respect.   In this case, I would say, those are , you know —our mandate is for maximum 
employment and price stability and the other things that we do , and that ’s what we ’re trying to 
accomplish.  We’re trying to do that in a way that sustains the strong growth we ’re seeing, the 
strong labor market we ’re seeing, but allows us to make further progress with inflation.   That’s 
how we can best serve the public and leave the other issues, which in many cases are incredibly 
important, such as those you mentioned, leave those to the people who have responsibility for 
those.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  There was another letter from two dozen lawmakers saying 
that the higher rates are squeezing the working people.  How do these letters affect what you 
guys are doing , policy -wise?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We receive these letters with respect , and we write careful responses 
and address concerns .  We listen, again, because we ’re talking to the people who , in our system 
of government , have oversight over our activity.  So that ’s—but at the end of the day, we take 
that on  board , but we have to make our judgments , and we have to “stick to our knitting ”—
which is maximum employment, price stability, supervise and regulate the banks, work on the 
payment system :  the things that we do.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire.  
CLAIRE JONES.  Thank you.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   Thanks a lot for the 
opportunity to ask a question.  As Chair of the FOMC, would you want to see unanimity on the 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 24 
 Committee or something close to it, meaning no more than one dissent, before you begin cutting 
rates?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’re a very consensus -oriented organization , and we do try to 
achieve consensus and , ideally , unanimity .  People do dissent .  It’s something that happens.   Life 
goes on , and it ’s not a problem.  We’ve always had dissent s.  But—and so I —you know, you 
respect thoughtful dissents very much.   It’s like, you may not agree with some arguments, but 
you really want to understand them .  So you may read a book that takes a position that you have 
long opposed , just to understand [the position of] that book.  So I treat dissents with real respect 
as well.  
MICHELLE SMITH. Simon.  
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist.   Can you hear me?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes. 
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Okay .  Great.  Obviously , inflation is some ways away from 
target .  Unemployment , though, if you look at the projection for the full year of 4.0 percent, in 
February , we were already at 3.9 percent, so quite close to the median projection.  Are you 
concerned at all that —notwithstanding the very strong jobs growth —that in fact there may be 
some cracks appearing in the employment market?  You talked about a significant deterioration 
in the labor market being a condition for easing rates.   What would constitute that in your books?  
Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL. So we , of course , monitor —it’s one of our two goal variables .  We all 
monitor the labor market very, very carefully.  And I don ’t see those cracks today.   And I, you 
know —we follow all the possible stories that are out there about , about there  being cracks , but 
the overall picture really is a strong labor market .  The extreme imbalances that we saw in the 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 24 
 early parts of the pandemic recovery have mostly been resolved.  You’re seeing high job growth .  
You’re seeing big increases in supply .  You’re seeing strong wage growth , but wage growth is 
gradually moderating down to more sustainable levels .  In many, many respects , the things are 
returning more to their state in 2019, which we can think of as normal for this purpose .  That’s 
job openings and quits .  And surveys of workers and businesses are always interesting on this :  
You know, h ow tight is the —how easy is it to find a job ?  How hard is it —how easy it is to find 
a worker ?  Those have both —those surveys have both come down.   
So the labor market is —it’s in good shape .  You know, y ou do see things like the low —
the low  hiring rate , and people have made the argument that if , if layoffs were to increase, that 
would —that would  mean that the net would be fairly quick increases in unemployment.  So 
that’s something we ’re watching, but we ’re not seeing it.  Of course , initial claims are very, very 
low and, if anything, have tracked down a little bit.   So—watching it carefully .  Don’t see it.  
And when I say something —I, I use the term “unexpected ” weakening of the labor market.  So, 
you know,  we do expect the unemployment rate to —the forecast is that it would move up, I 
think , closer to what we see as the longer -run sustainable level .  That’s just—that’s just people ’s 
forecast, individual forecasts.   But we ’re talking about something that ’s unexpected.  That’s 
where I ’ll leave it , though.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.  Steve Matthews with Bloomberg.  You mentioned at the 
beginning of the press conference that the Committee thought it might be appropriate to slow the 
pace of asset runoff fairly soon.  I’m wondering is —when you say fairly soon, does that mean 
that the Committee would meet about this again in May and a decision could be reached that 
soon?  And I was wondering if you could also just describe the scope of what the Committee is 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 24 
 discussing here.  You’re at $95 billion of caps right now .  Would that be cut about in half or 
something in that nature?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL. So that is what we ’re discussing essentially is —and we ’re not 
discussing all the other many other balance sheet issues.  We will discuss those in due course .  
But what we ’re really looking at is slowing the pace of runoff.  There isn't much runoff among 
MBS—in MBS right now , but there is in Treasuries .  And w e’re talking about going to a lower 
pace.   I don ’t want to give you a specific number because we haven ’t made a —haven ’t had an 
agreement or decision, but that ’s the idea.  And that ’s what we ’re looking at.  
In terms of the timing, I said fairly soon.  I wouldn ’t want to try to be more specific than 
that, but you get the idea.  The idea is —and this is in our longer -run plans —that we may actually 
be able to get to a lower level, because we would avoid the kind of frictions that can happen.   
Liquidity is not evenly distributed in a system .  And there can be times when , in the aggregate, 
reserves are ample or even abundant , but not in every part .  And those parts where they ’re not 
ample, there can be stress , and that can cause you to prematurely stop the process to avoid the 
stress .  And then it would be very hard to restart , we think .  So something like that happened in  
’19 perhaps .  So that ’s what we ’re doing .  We’re looking at what would be a good time and what 
would be a good structure , and “fairly soon ” is words that we use to mean fairly soon.  
STEVE MATTHEWS.   And will there be a discussion about returning to an all -
Treasuries balance sheet at some point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So that —our, our longer -run goal is to return to a balance sheet that 
is mostly Treasuries.   I do expect that , once we ’re through this , we’ll come back to the other 
issues about the composition and the maturity and revisit those issues, but it ’s, you know,  not 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 24 
 urgent right now.  We want to get this , this  decision made first and then we can, when the time is 
right, come back to the other issues.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico.  Also on the balance sheet, you 
know, can you talk a little bit about how the outlook for the banking sector might impact your 
balance sheet plans?   Do you worry that , as deposits start to shrink , that we could see more 
turbulence?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, w e’ll be watching carefully .  But one of the reasons 
we’re slowing down —we will soon enough, fairly soon I should say, slow down —is that we 
want to avoid any , any  kind of that turbulence.  I wasn ’t think ing particularly about the banking -
sector turbulence, but we —and we had some indicators the last time.  This is our second time in 
doing this, and I think we ’re going to be paying a lot of attention to the things that started to 
happen and that foreshadowed what eventually happened at the end of that tightening cycle 
where we wound up in a short [-of-]reserves situation.  And w e don’t want to do that again.  And 
I think now we have a better sense of what are the indicators.   It isn ’t—it wasn ’t so much in the 
banking system as it was around, for example, where federal funds  are trading relative to the 
administered rates and where secured rates are relative to the administered rates.  Those sorts of 
things.  We will always be watching the banking system for similar signs , though.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Well, is it also because you ’re not sure exactly how the reserve 
supply will react once the overnight reverse repo facility drops near —at zero?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , I think we broadly think that , once  [take -up at]  the overnight 
[reverse] repo [facility] stabilizes, either at zero or close to zero, that , as the balance sheet 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 24 
 shrinks , we should expect that reserves will decline pretty close to dollar -for-dollar with that.  
That’s what we think.  
MICHELLE SMI TH.  Let’s go to Jean.  
JEAN YUNG.  Hi Chair Powell .  Jean Yung with MNI Market News.   I wanted to ask 
also about the balance sheet.  Will you —you said that starting the taper sooner could get you to a 
smaller balance sheet size.   Does that mean you don ’t have to make a decision on when to end 
QT at this point ?  And will you be setting up the process for deciding that sooner , or will you 
wait until we ’re close to the end?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So it’s sort of ironic that , by going slower , you can get farther .  But 
that’s the idea.  The idea is that , with a smoother transition, you won ’t—you’ll run much less risk 
of kind of liquidity problems , which can grow into shocks , and which can cause you to stop the 
process prematurely.   So that ’s—in terms of how it ends, we ’re going to be monitoring carefully 
money market conditions and asking ourselves whether they —what they ’re telling us about 
reserves.  Are they —right now , we would characterize them as “abundant, ” and what we ’re 
aiming for is “ample ” and, you know, which is a little bit less than abundant.   So there isn ’t a—
you know, there ’s not a dollar amount or a percent of GDP or anything like that where we think 
we have a really pretty clear understanding of that.  We’re going to be looking at what these —
what ’s happening in money markets , in particular —a bunch of different indicators, including the 
ones I mentioned, to tell us when we ’re getting close.  Then , though, you reach a point ultimately 
where you stop allowing the balance sheet to run  off and you —but then, from that point, there ’s 
another period in which nonreserves —nonreserve liabilities grow organically , like currency, and 
that also shrinks the reserves at a very slow pace.  So you have a , you know, a  slower pace of 
runoff, which we ’ll have fairly soon .  Then you have another time where you effectively hold the 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 24 
 balance sheet constant and allow nonreserve liabilities to expand .  And then that ultimately 
brings you, ideally, in for —brings it into a nice, easy landing at a level that is above —you know, 
above what we think the lowest possible ample number would be.  We’re not trying for that .  We 
want to have a cushion, a b uffer , because we know that demand for reserves can be very volatile .  
And we don ’t want to, again , find ourselves in a situation where there aren ’t reserves , and w e 
have to turn around and buy assets and put reserves back in the banking system the way we did 
in 2019 and  ’20. 
MICHELLE SMITH:  Nancy.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair 
Powell, you said you ’re waiting to become more confident that inflation ’s getting to your  
2 percent goal before you cut rates.   Can you just sum up more specifically what data you ’re 
looking at that would give you that confidence?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Sure.  So we ’re—most importantly , we’re looking at the incoming 
inflation data and the contents of it and what they ’re telling us , so that ’ll be—and also the 
various components —so obviously that ’s what we want .  We want more confidence that 
inflation is coming down sustainably toward 2 percent.  And, I mean , of course we ’ll also be 
looking at all the other things that are happening in the economy .  We’ll look at the totality of the 
data, including everything essentially as we make that assessment .  But the most important thing 
will be the inflation data coming in.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Well, are there things that you would give more 
weight to , like wages?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Wages is one thing.   We don ’t—our target is not wages .  It’s really 
inflation.  But we would look to the fact that wages are still coming in very strong .  But, but 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 24 
 they’ve been —wage increases , that’s to say —wage increases have been quite strong, but they ’re, 
they’re  gradually coming down to levels that are more sustainable over time.  And that ’s what 
we want.  We don ’t think that —the inflation was not originally caused —we think, I don ’t think, 
by mostly by wages.   That wasn ’t really the story.  But we do think that , to get inflation back 
down to  2 percent sustainably, we ’d like to see , you know,  continuing gradual movement of 
wage increases at still high levels but back down to levels that are more sustainable over time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let’s go to Greg.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you .  Greg Robb from MarketWatch.   Chair Powell, could you say 
at this meeting whether there were more officials who want ed to be careful and go slower than —
about rates —than there were at the last meeting?   Was there —was there  that sense of maybe it ’s 
smart to wait?  Thanks.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I guess I ’d put it this way :  The—if you look at the incoming 
inflation data that we ’ve had for January and February, I think very broadly that suggests that we 
were  right to wait until we ’re more confident.  So I think , I think —I didn ’t hear anyone 
dismissing it as not information that we should look at or anything like that.   So I think , generally 
speaking , it does go in the direction of saying , yes, it ’s appropriate for us to be careful as we 
approach this question.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Brendan.  
BRENDAN PEDERSEN.  Thanks Chair Powell.  Brendan Pedersen with Punchbowl 
News.   I wanted to ask you about central bank digital currency stuff.  We’ve been hearing a lot 
from Republicans in Congress about what the Fed is or isn ’t doing in a digital dollar, but I know 
you have said to Congress that you ’re going to wait for approval before the Fed does anything —
launches anything .  But folks like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer have said that the Fed is 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 24 
 either actively researching or hiring personnel to study the implications of the CBDC.   Can you 
give us any clarity on what the Fed is doing right now on a digital dollar?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.   So I think we ’ve been pretty transparent on this, but I will —
I’ll try harder.  So we are not getting ready to —we haven ’t proposed —we haven ’t come to a 
conclusion that we should propose , or anything like that, that Congress consider legislation to 
authorize a digital dollar.   And it would take legislation by Congress signed by the President to 
give us the ability to do what we think of as a CBDC, which is really a retail CBDC with the 
public.   So we ’re just a long, long way from that.  What we are doing , and I think what every 
major central bank is doing, is we ’re trying to stay in the frontiers of what ’s going on in digital 
finance , and it has many, many different areas .  It has applications in wholesale finance, in the 
payment system, and so we need —to serve the public —these issues have become very front 
burner in the last five or six years —we need to be knowledgeable about all that.   So we actually 
do have people trying to understand things that are —but it ’s wrong to say that we ’re working on 
a CBDC and that we ’ve secretly got a lab here where we’ve got one , and we ’re just going to 
spring it on Congress at the right moment.  We don ’t.  I haven ’t at all , in my own mind , made a 
decision that I think this is something the U.S. should be doing.   I just think it ’s something we 
need to be —we need to understand.  We do have people who are keeping up with that, as part of 
the broader payments landscape.  That’s, that’s  how I would characterize it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Mark.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you.  It’s Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.   Mr. Chairman, 
April  27 will mark the 13th anniversary since a Fed Chairman began holding regular news 
conferences.   How important is that higher transparency been in your view, both for the proper 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 24 
 functioning of the central bank and also in accomplishing your mission ?  And is there more that 
you and your colleagues can do on the transparency front ?  And what might that look like?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I generally think —I mean , this movement actually started 30 years 
ago—30 years ago, when some academics posited that a more transparent central bank, if the 
public understands your reaction function, the markets will do your work for you .  They’ll react 
to the data.  And so it all happens that way and so there ’s been a march toward greater and 
greater transparency.  And that —certainly Chairman Bernanke advanced that, Chairman 
Greenspan did, Chair Yellen did, and I .  You know, s o we went from four press conferences a 
year to eight, so now every meeting really is “live” now.   I think that ’s a good innovation .  I 
wouldn ’t want to turn it back.  
We also have done a bunch of other things .  You know, w e have an annual supervision 
report, Financial Stability R eport .  I mean , there ’s a long list of things that we ’ve done.  I think 
you—I mean , nothing comes to mind as really desperately  in need of doing  at this moment .  
We’re very transparent .  We have no shortage of FOMC participants speaking to the public 
through the media.   And so that channel is full , I would say.  So I think it ’s generally broadly 
helped and made things better .  But not every day and in every way.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Well , to follow up :  Has there ever been a day where you wanted to 
put that genie back in the bottle somewhat?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Of course not.   [Laughter]  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Let’s go to Jennifer , for the last question.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you , Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.   Not to harp too much more on confidence and inflation , but you did say earlier 
in this press conference that the recent inflation data hasn ’t raised anyone ’s confidence.  But 
March 20, 2024  Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 24 
 when you testified before the Senate a couple weeks ago, you told lawmakers that you are “not 
far from receiving the confidence needed on inflation to begin cutting rates. ”  So are you still of 
that belief or not?  What are we to take by those words, “not far? ” 
CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say my main message at that —in those two days of 
hearings was really that the Committee needs to see more evidence to build our confidence that 
inflation is moving down sustainably toward our 2 percent goal , and we don ’t expect that it will 
be appropriate to begin to reduce rates until we ’re more confident  that that is the case.  I said that 
any number of times , so those were kind of the main part of the message.   We repeated that 
today in our statement.   I also —to the language you mentioned, I , I really pointed out that we 
had made significant progress over the past year, and what we ’re looking for now is confirmation 
that that progress will continue.   We had a series of inflation readings over the second half of last 
year that were really much lower .  We didn ’t overreact , as I mentioned .  But that ’s what I had in 
mind.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  But given that you said that PCE for February, 
2.8 percent the estimate , and that we have been seeing PCE —core PCE coming down by a tenth 
of a percent every month, I mean , wouldn ’t you be at about 2.4 percent this summer, June , July, 
to a point where you could cut then?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we ’ll just have to see how the data come in.  We would , of 
course , love to get great inflation data.  We got really good inflation data on the second —in the 
second part of last year .  Again, we didn ’t overreact to it .  We said we needed to see more , and 
we said it would be bumpy .  And now we have January and February, which I ’ve talked about a 
couple of times.  So, you know,  we’re looking for more good data , and we would certainly 
welcome it.   Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s  Press Conference 
May 1, 2024 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  
The economy has made considerable progress toward our dual -mandate objectives.  Inflation has 
eased substantially over the past year , while the labor market has remained strong .  And that’s  
very good news.  But inflation is still too high, further progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.  We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.  Restoring price stability is essential to achi eve a sustainably strong labor market 
that benefits all.  
Today , the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to 
reduce our securities holdings, though at a slower pace.  Our restrictive stance of monetary 
policy has been putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation, and the risks  to 
achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past 
year.  However, in recent months , inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 
2 percent objective, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  I’ ll have more to say about 
monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.  
Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 
1.6 percent in the first quarter, private domestic f inal purchases—which excludes inventory 
investment, government spending and net exports , and usually sends a clearer signal on 
underlying demand—was 3.1 percent in the first quarter, as strong as the second half of 2023.  Consumer spending has been robust over the past several quarte rs, even as high interest rates

Page 2 of 26 
 have weighed on housing and equipment investment.  Improving supply conditions have 
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year. 
The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply  and demand conditions have come 
into better balance.  Payroll job gains averaged 276,000 jobs per month in the first quarter, while the unemployment rate remains low at 3.8 percent.  Strong job creation over the past year has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of immigration.  Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year and the jobs- to-workers gap has narrowed, but labor 
demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. 
Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above our longer-run goal of 
2 percent.  T otal PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in March; excluding the 
volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent.   The inflation data 
received so far this year have been higher than expected.  Although s ome measures of short -term 
inflation expectations have increased in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective. 
The Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent and to continue the process of significantly reducing our securities

Page 3 of 26  
 holdings, though at a slower pace.  Over the past year, as labor market tightness has eased and 
inflation has declined, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance.  The economic outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  
We’ve stated that we do not expect  that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range 
for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  So far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence.  In particular, and as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations.  It is likely that gaining such greater confidence will take longer than previously expected.  We are prepared to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for as long as appropriate.  We’re also prepared to respond to an unexpected weakening in the labor market.  
We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of 
the progress we ’ve seen on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too 
little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully ass ess incoming data, 
the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in  pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.  We will continue to 
make decisions meeting by meeting.  
Turning to our balance sheet :  The Committee decided at today’s meeting to slow the 
pace of decline in our securities holdings, consistent with the plans we released previously.  Specifically, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from the current $60  billion per 
month to $25 billion per month as of June 1.  Consistent with the Committee’s intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run, we ’re leaving the cap on agency securities 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 26  
 unchanged per month, and  we will reinvest any proceeds in excess of this cap in Treasury 
securities.  With principal payments on agency securities currently running at about $15 billion 
per month, total portfolio runoff will amount to roughly $40 billion per month.  The decision to slow the pace of runoff does not mean that our balance sheet will ultimately shrink by less than it would otherwise but rather allows us to approach its ultimate level more gradually.  In particular, slowing the pace of runoff wi ll help ensure a smooth transition, reducing the possibility that 
money markets experience stress and thereby facilitating the ongoing decline in our securities holdings that are consistent with reaching the appropriate level of ample reserves.  
We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to 
keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stability is essential to 
set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.  
To conclude :  We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and 
businesses across the country.  Everything we do is in service to our public mission.  We , at the 
Fed, will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  A question and 
follow -up if I could, do you consider the current policy rate still —are you confident that it ’s 
sufficiently restrictive to get inflation back to 2 percent?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I do think the evidence shows , you know, pretty clearly that 
policy is restrictive and is weighing on demand, and there are a few places I would point to for that.  You can start with the labor market .  So demand is still strong—the demand side of the 
labor market , in particular—but it ’s cooled from its extremely high level of a couple years ago, 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 26  
 and you see that in job openings .  You saw it —more evidence of that today in the JOLTS report , 
as you’ ll know.  It’ s still higher than pre -pandemic .  But it has been coming down both in the 
Indeed r eport and the JOLTS  report .  That’s, that’s  demand cooling.  The same is true of quits 
and hiring rates, which have essentially normalized.  I also look at the —we look at surveys of 
workers and —pardon me —surveys of workers and businesses , and [they] ask workers , “Are jobs 
plentiful? ” and ask businesses, “ Are workers plentiful?   Is it easy to find workers ?”  And you’ ve 
seen that the answers to those have come back down to pre -pandemic levels.  You also see in 
interest -sensitive spending, like housing and investment —you also see that higher  interest rates 
are weighing on those activities.  So I do think it ’s clear that , that  policy is restrictive.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Sufficiently restrictive, I guess.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I would say that we believe it is restrictive , and we believe  [that] 
over time it will be sufficiently restrictive.  That will be a question that, that  the data will have to 
answer.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So as a follow -up, if inflation continues running roughly 
sideways as it has been, the job market stays reasonably strong, unemployment low, and 
expectations are anchored and maintained, would you disrupt that for — 
CHAIR POWELL.  Expectations are not anchored?  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Are anchored.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Are anchored.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Stable, roughly .  Would you disrupt that for the last half point 
on PCE?  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don’ t want to get into complicated hypotheticals .  But I 
would say that , you know, we ’re committed to retaining our current restrictive stance of policy 
for as long as is appropriate .  And w e’ll do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna .  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Thanks for taking our questions , Chair Powell.  I wonder —you 
know, obviously Michelle Bowman has been saying that there is a risk that rates may need to 
increase further, although it ’s not her baseline outlook.  I wonder if you see that as a risk as well, 
and, if so, what change in conditions would merit considering raising rates at this point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it ’s unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. 
I’d say it ’s unlikely.  You know, our policy focus is really what I just mentioned, which is —
which is  how long to keep policy restrictive.  You ask , what would it take ?  You know, I think 
we’d need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring 
inflation sustainably down to 2 percent over time.  That’s not —that’s not  what we think we ’re 
seeing, as I —as I  mentioned, but that’s —something like that is what it would take.  We’d look at 
the totality of the data in  answer  to that question .  That would include inflation, inflation 
expectations, and all the other data too. 
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Would that be —would that be  a reacceleration in inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, I think , again, the test —what I ’m saying is , if we were to come 
to that conclusion that policy weren’ t tight enough to achieve that , so it would be the totality of 
all the things we ’d be looking at.  It could be expectations .  It could be a combination of things .  
But, if we —if we reach that conclusion—and we don’ t see evidence supporting that 
conclusion —that ’s what it would take I think for us to take that step.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Chris.  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 26  
 CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  You 
didn’ t mention the idea that rates are at a peak for the cycle and didn ’t mention the idea that it 
might be appropriate to cut rates later this year as you have in previous press conferences.  So 
has the F ed sort of dropped its easing bias?  Where are you standing on that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, on —let me address cuts.  So, obviously , our decisions that we 
make on our policy rate are going to depend on the incoming data, how the outlook is evolving, and the balance of risks, as always.  And we ’ll look at the totality of the data.  So I think, and we 
think, that policy is well  positioned to address different paths that the economy might take.  And 
we’ve said that we don’ t think it would be appropriate to dial back our restrictive policy stance 
until we ’ve gained greater confidence  that inflation is moving down sustainably toward 
2 percent.  So, for example, let me take a path :  If we did have a path where inflation proves 
more persistent than expected and where the labor market remains strong , but inflation is moving 
sideways and we’ re not gaining greater confidence, well, that would be a case in which it could 
be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts. 
I think there ’s also other paths that the economy could take , which , which would cause us 
to want to consider rate cuts .  And those would be —two of those paths would be that we do gain 
greater confidence, as we ’ve said, that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent , and 
another path could be , you know, an unexpected weakening in the labor market, for example.  So 
those are paths in which you could see us cutting rates.  So I think it really will depend on the data.  In terms of peak rate, you know, I think , really , it’s the same question .  I, I think the dat a 
will have to answer that question for us. 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 26  
 CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  And could you just follow —on the path where you might 
not cut, is that —you mentioned that would be inflation persistent —I mean, is inflation —would 
that be the key data in making that decision, or could you expand a bit more on that?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Again, it ’s, it’s—we ’ve set ourselves a test that we —for us to begin 
to reduce policy restriction, we ’d want to be confident that inflation is moving—you know, 
moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and, for sure , one of the things we ’d be looking at is the 
performance of inflation.  We’d also be looking at inflation expectations .  We’d be looking at the 
whole story .  But clearly, incoming , incoming inflation data would be at the very heart of that 
decision.  
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, to what 
extent has the easing in financial conditions since November contributed to the reacceleration in 
growth, and do you now expect a period of sustained tighter financial conditions will be needed 
to resume the sort of disinflation the e conomy saw last year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it ’s hard to know that.  I think we ’ll be able to look back, 
you know, from down the road and look back and understand it better.  You know, i f you look 
at—let ’s look at growth.  R eally , what we ’ve seen so far this year in the first quarter is growth 
coming in about consistent with where it was last year.  I know GDP came in lower , but you 
don’t see an acceleration in growth .  I mean , the thought would be that financial conditions 
loosened in, in, December , and that caused an uptic k in activity , and that caused inflation.  
Presumably , that’s what we ’re tightening in the labor market.  You don’ t really see that 
happening.  What you see is economic activity at a level that ’s roughly the same as , as last year.   
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 26  
 So, you know, what ’s causing this inflation ?  You know, we ’ll, we’ll  have a better sense of that 
over time .  I don’ t know that there ’s an obvious connection there , though, with easing of 
financial conditions.   In terms of tightening, you ’re, you’re  right .  Rates are certainly higher now 
and have been for some time than they were before the December meeting .  And they’ re higher , 
and that ’s tighter financial conditions .  And, you know, that ’s appropriate , given what inflation 
has done in the first quarter.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  You’ve said in the past that stronger growth wouldn’ t necessarily 
preclude rate cuts.   I wonder , would continued strength in the labor market change your view 
about the appropriate stance of policy if it was accompanied by signs the wage growth was 
reaccelerating ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I just want to be careful that we don ’t target wage growth or the 
labor market .  And remember what we saw last year :  very strong growth, a really tight labor 
market, and a historically fast decline in inflation.   So—and that ’s because we know there are 
two forces at work here .  There’s the unwinding of the pandemic -related supply- side distortions 
and demand -side distortions, and there ’s also monetary policy, you know, restrictive monetary 
policy.  So I wouldn’ t rule out that something lik e that can continue .  You know, I wouldn’ t give 
up, at this point, on further things happening on the supply side either because , you know, we do 
see that companies still report that there are supply -side issues that they ’re facing .  And also , 
even when the supply- side issues are solved , it should take some time for that to affect economic 
activity and ultimately inflation.   So there are still those things.  So I don’ t like to say that either 
strong—either growth or , or a strong labor market , in and of itself , would automatically create 
problems on inflatio n, because , of course , it didn’ t do that last year.  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 26  
 You ask about wages .  We also don ’t—we don’ t target wages.  We target price inflation.  
It is one of the inputs .  The point with wages is , of course , we, like everyone else, like to see high 
wages, but we also want to see them not eaten up by high inflation.  A nd that ’s really what we ’re 
trying to do,  is to cool the economy and work with what ’s happening on the supply side to 
bring—to bring the economy back to 2 percent inflation.   Part of that will probably be having 
wage increases move down incrementally toward levels that are more sustainable.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell .  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  You talked about needing time to gain more confidence that inflation is 
sustainably moving back down to 2 percent .  It’s May now .  Do you have time this year to cut 
three times, just given the calendar?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  I’m not really thinking of it that way.  You know, the —what 
we said is that we need to be more confident , and we ’ve said —my colleagues and I today said 
that we didn ’t see progress in the first —in the first quarter .  And I’ve said that it appears , then, 
that it’ s going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence .  So I don’ t know how long 
it’ll take .  You know, I can just say that when we get that confidence, then rate cuts will be in 
scope .  And I don’ t know exactly when that will be. 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And, with hindsight, are there any signs that you can look back on 
now, looking at the reports from January or February or March, that suggested something more 
worrying than just expected bumpiness?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I —you know, not really .  You know, what , what —so I thought it was 
appropriate to reserve judgment until , until  we had the full quarter ’s data, until we saw the March 
data.   And so take a step back .  What do we now see in the first quarter?  We see strong economic 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11  of 26  
 activity, we see a strong labor market, and we see inflation.  We see three inflation readings , and 
so I think you’ re at a point there where you should take some signal.  We don’ t like to react to 
one or two months ’ data, but this is a full quarter .  And I think it ’s appropriate to take signal now, 
and we are taking signal.   And the signal that we ’re taking is that it ’s likely to take longer for us 
to gain confidence that we are on a sustainable path down to 2 percent inflation.  That’s the 
signal that we ’re taking now .  Yeah. 
MICHELLE SMITH.   Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chair, if I could —Steve Liesman, CNBC.   If I could follow  up 
on that :  What particular areas were sort of temporary or blips in the inflation data in the first 
quarter?   What’s the dynamic by which you expect them to work out in the coming months and 
quarters?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So we will —you know, we will put the thing —we have put 
the thing under a microscope.  I will say , nothing is going to come out of  that that ’s going to 
change the view .  I think that, in fact, we didn’ t gain confidence and that it ’s going to take longer 
to get that confidence —but—confidence.   I just think —you know the story .  What’s happened 
since December is you’ ve seen higher goods inflation than expected, and you’ ve seen higher 
nonhousing services inflation than expected.  A nd those two are working together to, to  sort of be 
higher than we had thought.  And there are stories behind how that happened, and, you know, 
we—I think —I thin k my expectation is that we will, over the course of this year, see inflation 
move back down.  That’s, that’s  my forecast .  I think my confidence in that is lower than it was 
because of the data that we’ ve seen.  So, you know, we ’re looking at th ose things .  We also 
continue to expect, and I continue to expect , that housing services inflation, given where market 
rents are, those will show up in measured housing services inflation over time.   We believe that it 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 26  
 will.  I t just —it looks like the lag— that there are substantial lags between when , you know, 
lower market rates turned up and —for new tenants and when it shows up for existing tenants or 
for in -housing services.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  If I could just follow  up:  Is there a bit of a contradiction in the idea 
that you are reducing quantitative tightening, which is sort of an easing, while you ’re holding 
rates steady at a restrictive rate to try to slow and cool the economy and inflation?   Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t say that .  No.  I mean , the active tool of monetary policy 
is, of course , the interest rates .  And this is —this is a long—a plan we ’ve long had in place to 
slow, really not in order to , you know, provide accommodation to the economy but to—or to be 
less restrictive to the economy .  It really is to ensure that the process of shrinking the balance 
sheet down to where we want to get it is a smooth one and doesn’ t wind up in —wi th financial 
market turmoil the way it did the last —the las t time we did this and the only other time we ’ve 
ever done this.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Craig.  
CRAIG TORRES.  Craig Torres from Bloomberg.   Two questions .  First, a simple one .  
Given the run of data since March, has the probability in your mind of no cuts this year increased 
or stayed the same?  That’s the first question.   Second question.  Chair Powell, you joined the 
Board in 2012, and I ’m sure you remember , as I do , what the jobless recovery was like :  lawyers, 
accountants, all kinds of highly qualified people who couldn’ t get jobs.  And given your history 
there, I wonder if there ’s an argument for being more patient with inflation here.  We have strong 
productivity growth that ’s helping wages grow up—go up.  W e have good employment .  And so 
it seems to me there ’s a lot of hysteria about inflation.  I agree —you know, nobody likes it, but is 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 26  
 there an argument for being patient and working with the economic cycle to get it down over 
time?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on your first question, I don’ t have a probability estimate for you.  
But all I can say is that , you know, we ’ve said that we didn’ t think it would be appropriate to cut 
until we were more confident that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent .  We 
didn’ t get our confidence , in that  [it] didn’ t increase in the first quarter .  And, in fact, what really 
happened was we came to the view that it will take longer to get that confidence.  And I think 
there are—you know, I think it’s —the economy has been very hard for forecasters broadly to 
predict —to predict  its path .  But there are paths to , to not cutting, and there are paths to cutting.  
It’s really going to depend on the data. 
In terms of the employment mandate, to your point, if you go back a couple of years, our , 
our sort of framework document says that , when you look at the two mandate goals, and if one of 
them is further away from goal than the other, then you focus on that one.   It actually —it’s the 
time to get back there times  the, you know, times  how far it is from the goal.  And that was 
clearly inflation.  So our focus was very much on inflation.  As—and this is what we referred to 
in the statement .  As inflation has com e down, now to below 3 percent on a —on a 12- month 
basis, it ’s become —we ’re now focusing [ on] the other goal .  The employment goal now comes 
back into focus.  And so we are focusing on it.  And, a nd that ’s how we think about that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire.  
CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   Thanks a lot for the opportunity to ask 
the questions.  Just to go back to the answer before the previous one, it seemed to suggest that you think the likeliest path of inflation is one that ’s going to allow you to have a situation where 
rates are lower at the end of the year than they are right now.  It’d be good if you could just 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 26  
 confirm whether or not that ’s a correct reading.  And the Q1  GDP print has  led to some —some to 
start mentioning the term “ stagflation ” with respect to the U.S. economy.  Do you or anyone else 
on the FOMC think this is now a risk?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah .  I’m not dealing really in likelihoods.   I think there are —there 
are paths that the economy can take that would involve cuts and there are paths that wouldn’ t.  
And I don’ t have great confidence in which of those paths —I think I would say my personal 
forecast is that we will begin to see further progress on inflation this year.  I don’ t know that it 
will be enough, sufficient.  I don’ t know that it won’ t.  I think we ’re going to have to let the data 
lead us on that . 
In terms of your question—your second question was stagflation.  I guess I would say I 
was around for stagflation, and it was , you know, 10 percent —10 percent unemployment .  It was 
high single -digits inflation .  Right now we have —and very slow growth—so right now we have 
3 percent growth, which is , you know, pretty solid growth I would say, by any measure, and we 
have inflation running under 3 percent.  So I don’ t—I don’t really understand where that ’s 
coming from.   And, in addition, I would say most forecasters, including our forecasting, was that 
last year ’s level of growth was very high—3.4 percent in , I guess, the fourth quarter , you know —
and probably not going to be sustained and would come down.  But that would be —that would 
be our forecast.  That wouldn’ t be stagflation.  That would still be to a very healthy level of 
growth.  And, of course , with inflation, you know, our —we will return inflation to 2 percent, and 
that won’ t be—so I don’ t see the “stag” or the “flation,”  actually.  [Laughter]  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  The Vice 
Chair of the FOMC said recently that he’ s willing to consider the idea that potential growth has 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 26  
 moved up.  A nd, of course , he’s “Mr. Potential Growth /r*.”  Do you share that view , and would 
that imply that maybe policy isn ’t tight enough?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think I would take that question this way:  We saw a year of 
very high productivity growth in 2023, and we saw a year of , I think , negative productivity 
growth in 2022.  S o I think it ’s hard to draw from the data .  I mean , the question is , will 
productivity run—there are two questions .  One is:  Will productivity run persistently above its 
longer -run trend?   I don’ t think we know that.  In terms of potential output, though, that ’s a 
separate question .  We’ve had a —what amounts to a , a significant increase in the potential output 
of the economy that ’s not about productivity .  It was about having more labor, frankly, both 
through—in 2022, both through participation and also through immigration.  So we ’re very 
much—like other forecasters and economists—getting our arms around what that means for 
potential output this year and next year —and last year for that matter , too.  So I think —in that 
case, I think you really do have a significant increase in potential output, but you’ ve also got —so 
you’ve got more supply .  But those people also come in, they work, they have jobs, they spend.  
So you’ ve also got demand.  So  it—there may be —it may be that you get more supply than you 
get demand at the beginning, but , ultimately , it should be neither inflationary nor disinflationary 
over, over  a longer period. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  You said earlier that , at this point , you’ re not really considering 
rate increases.   If growth is higher , but you’ re not considering rate increases, does that imply that 
you’re more worried about causing the economy to slow too much than you are about inflation 
taking off again?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No .  I think we , we believe our policy stance is in a good place and is 
appropriate to the current situation.  We believe it ’s restrictive, and , you know, we —our evidence 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 26  
 for that, I went over earlier .  You see it in the labor market .  You see it in inflation -sensitive 
spending, where demand has clearly come down a lot over the past few years.  And that ’s, that’s  
more from monetary policy, whereas the supply side  of things that are happening are more on the 
supply side.  So that ’s how I would think about it.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence from F ox 
Business.  So GDP growth is about 2  percent .  Inflation —[Un] employment is about 4 percent .  It 
feels a lot like a steady state, and we have 3 percent inflation .  So if the data remains the same 
that you ’re seeing, and I know you said you don’ t see a rate hike, but it stands to reason that you 
would need a rate hike to get from 3 to 2 percent inflation.  So was there any discussion about a rate hike in today’ s meeting , and, you know, are you satisfied with 3  percent inflation for the rest 
of the year?  
CHAIR POWELL.   Well, of course we ’re not satisfied with 3  percent inflation.  “ Three 
percent ” can’t be in a sentence with “ satisfied. ”  [Laughter]  So  we will return inflation to 
2 percent over time but over time.   And we think our policy stance is , is appropriate to do that.  
So if we were to conclude that policy is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2 percent, then that would be what it would take for us to want to increase rates.  We 
don’t see that .  We don’ t see evidence for that.  So that ’s where we are.  
EDWARD LA WRENCE.  Was there discussion about a rate hike at all?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the policy focus has been on—has really been on what to do 
about , about  holding the current —the current level of restriction.  That’s really —that’s part of the 
policy .  That’s where the policy discussion was in the meeting.  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 26  
 EDWARD LAWRENCE.   I wanted to follow [ up] on the 3 percent .  Is there a time frame 
of persistent inflation that would trigger a rate hike?  
CHAIR POWELL.  There isn ’t any rule .  You can’t  look to a rule .  You know, t hese are—
these are going to be judgment calls.  You know, c learly restrictive monetary policy needs more 
time to do its job.  That, that  is pretty clear , based on what we ’re seeing .  How long that will take 
and how patient we should be is going to depend on the totality of the data, how the outlook 
evolves.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guid a with Politico.  You’ve talked about your 
commitment to being apolitical and nonpartisan.  A nd I was just wondering, given that it ’s an 
election year, is the bar for rate changes higher close to an election ?  And, similarly, is there a 
significant economic difference between , you know, starting to cut in , say, September versus 
December?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So we ’re, we’re  always going to do what we think the right thing for 
the economy is when we come to that consensus view that it ’s the right thing to do for the 
economy.  That’s our record .  That’s what we do.  We’re not looking at anything else .  You know, 
it’s hard enough to get the economics right here.  These are difficult things , and if , if we were to 
take on a whole , another , set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood 
we’d actually get the economics right.  So that ’s how we think about it around here.  And, you 
know , we’re at peace over it.  We know that we ’ll do what we think is the right thing, when we 
think it ’s the right thing .  And we ’ll all do that.  And that ’s, that’s  how everybody around here 
thinks.  So I can ’t say it enough, that we just don’ t—we just don’ t go down that road.  If you go 
down that road, where do you stop?  And, and so we ’re not on that road.  W e’re on the road 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 26  
 where we ’re serving all the American people and making our decisions based on the data and 
how those data affect the outlook and the balance of risks.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  And then, is there a significant difference between , you know, 
whether you start in , say, September versus December ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  There ’s— 
VICTORIA GUIDA.  A n economic difference . 
CHAIR POWELL.  —a significant difference between an institution that takes into 
account all sorts of political events and one that doesn’ t.  That’s where the significant difference 
is, and, you know, we’re —we just don’ t do that.  I mean , you can go back and read the 
transcripts for every —this is my fourth election, fourth presidential election here .  Read all the 
transcripts , and see if anybody mentions , in any way, the pending election.  It just isn ’t part of 
our thinking.  It’ s not what we ’re hired to do.  If we start down that road, again, I don’ t know 
how you stop.  So.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Simon. 
SIMON RABINOVITCH.   Thank you, Chair Powell.   Question about the labor market —
you’ve mentioned a few times that the labor market is normalizing .  Certainly , today ’s JOLTS 
data suggested that things are kind of getting back to pre -pandemic levels.   One thing that hasn’ t 
normalized is wage growth, which is still quite a bit stronger than before the pandemic.  I wonder 
if you can share your analysis of , of why that ’s happening.  Is it a lagging indicator, or is 
something else going on?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I think if you go back to where wages peaked— wage increases 
peaked a couple , three years ago —essentially all wage measures have come down substantially 
[when compared] to that.  But they are not , not down to where they were before the pandemic.  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 26  
 They ’re still roughly a percentage point higher.  And we ’ve seen pretty consistent progress but 
not uniformly .  And you’ ll note the ECI reading from Tuesday was —it was expected to be —to 
have come down, and, essentially , it was flat year  over  year , you know, I think roughly .  So yeah, 
I mean , it’s—that part of it is bumpy .  And, again , we don’ t target wage increases, but , you know, 
in the longer run, if you have —if you have wage increases running higher than productivity 
would warrant, then, you know, there will be inflationary pressures.  Employers will raise prices 
over time if that ’s the case.  S o we ’ve seen progress.  I t has been inconsistent, but we have seen a 
substantial decline overall .  But we have a ways to go on that.  
MICHELLE SMITH .  Scott.  Nancy.  I’m sorry.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hey, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer from 
Marketplace.  You mentioned consumers , and consumers are feeling the weight of interest rates 
right now.  Mortgage rates are up , as are rates for car loans, credit cards.  P eople looking to 
borrow are very discouraged.  T hat’s reflected in their views on the economy.  What would you 
say to them?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, the thing that hurts everybody , and particularly people in the 
lower -income brackets, is inflation.   If you’ re a person who’ s living paycheck to paycheck, and 
suddenly all the things you buy—the fundamentals of life —go up in price, you, you are in 
trouble right away.  And so, with those people in mind, in particular, what we’ re doing is , we’re 
using our tools to bring down inflation.  It will take some time, but we will succeed .  And we will 
bring inflation back down to 2 percent , and t hen people won’ t have to worry about it again.  
That’s what we ’re doing, and we know that it ’s painful and inconvenient .  But the dividends will 
be paid and will be very large .  And, and everyone will share in those dividends , and we ’ve made 
quite a lot of progress if you can think about it.  I think core—I think headline —core PCE  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 26  
 [inflation] peaked at 5.8 [percent].  N ow it ’s at—anyway, headline peaked at 7.1.  N ow it ’s at 2.7.  
Don’t want to get that wrong. 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.   No, you don’ t.  Quick follow -up—are current interest 
rates really doing that much , though,  to fight inflation right now for those consumers?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  I mean , I think—I think that restrictive monetary policy is 
doing what it ’s supposed to do, and it’s —but it ’s also , in this case unusually , working alongside 
and with the healing of the supply side.  This, this —what was different this time was that a big 
part of the source of the inflation and the reason why we ’re having this conversation is that we 
had this supply- side kind of collapse , with shortages and bottlenecks and all that kind of thing.  
And so—and this was to do with the shutt ing down and reopening of the economy and other 
things that , that  really raised demand.  So, many factors did that.   So I think now you see those 
two things working together, the reversal of those supply and  demand distortions from the 
pandemic and the response to it, along with restrictive monetary policy .  Those two things are 
working to bring down inflation, and we ’ve made a lot of progress.   Let’s remember how far 
we’ve come.   And we have a ways to go.  W e’ve got work left to do, but we ’re not looking at the 
very high inflation rates that we were seeing two years ago.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Courtenay.  
COURTENAY BROWN.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Thanks for taking our 
questions, Chair Powell.  I wanted to follow  up on something you mentioned earlier on housing 
inflation .  There’s kind of been this long- awaited  disinflation in  shelter that still hasn ’t arrived.   
So I guess two questions, how do you explain the substantial lags between some of the private -
sector data we’ re seeing and the government data, and how confident are you that rents will be 
helpful on the inflation front in the coming months?  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.   So, essentially , there are—there are a number of places in the 
economy where there are just lag structures built into the inflation process , and housing is one of 
them.  So when you have —when , when someone goes to —a new person goes to rent an 
apartment, that ’s called market rent , and you can see market rents are barely going up at all.  The 
inflation in those has been very low.  But it takes —before that , they were incredibly high.  T hey 
sort of led the , the high part.  So what happens is , those market rents take years, actually , to get 
all the way into rents for tenants who are rolling over their leases.   Landlords don’ t tend to 
charge as much of an increase to a rollover tenant , for whatever reason.  A nd what that does is it 
builds up a sort of  an unrealized portion of increases when there have been big increases .  And 
what happens is , you know —it’s complicated , but the story is it just takes some time for that to 
get in.  Now I am confident that, as long as market rents remain low, this is going to show up in 
measured inflation, assuming that market rents do remain low.  How— what will be the exact 
timing of it?  I think we ’ve learned that the lags are longer .  We now think significantly longer 
than we thought at the beginning, and so confident t hat it will come but not so confident in the 
timing of it.   But, yes, I expect that , that  this will happen. 
COURTENAY BROWN.  Thanks.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick Jasinski . 
NICHOLAS JASINSKI.  Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the questions.  This is 
Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’ s Magazine.  It seems that over the past three or four years , 
economies and central banks in developed markets , at least , have been on more or less the same 
trajectory :  easing during the pandemic, fighting inflation with restrictive policy on the way out .  
It feels like that may be ending in 2024 based on some of the economic data from Europe and the U.S. and Japan and statements from those central banks as well.   So my question is, what , what  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 26  
 considerations or risks does a period of more divergent global economic trajectories and central 
bank policies present for the FOMC?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So that —you’ re right .  I think that, that  may happen,  and, you know 
that we all serve domestic mandates, right?  So I think the difference between the United States 
and other countries that are now considering rate cuts is that they’ re just not having the kind of 
growth we ’re having.  They have —their inflation is performing about like ours or maybe a little 
better, but they’ re not experiencing the kind of growth we ’re experiencing.  So we actually have 
the luxury of having strong growth and  a strong labor market, very low unemployment, high job 
creation, and all of that, and we can be patient .  And we will —we ’ll be careful and cautious as 
we approach the decision to cut rates, w hereas I think other jurisdictions may go before that.  
In terms of the implications, you know, I think obviously markets see it coming.  I t’s 
priced in now .  And so I think the markets and economies can adapt to i t.  And I think, you know, 
we haven ’t seen —in addition , for the emerging market economies, we haven’ t seen the kind of 
turmoil that was more frequent 20 years ago, 30 years ago.  A nd that ’s, I think, partly because 
emerging market countries, many of them have much better monetary policy frameworks, much more credibility on inflation .  And so they’ re na vigating this pretty well this time.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  You sort of backed away from the notion that the economy would need to 
encounter pain for inflation to come back down.  But , given the sticky inflation data in the first 
quarter, can disinflation still happen along a relatively painless path for the economy , or is some 
softening in the labor market and the economy likely needed to bring inflation back down?  
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 23 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.  So you’ re right .  I think we thought, and most people thought, there 
would have to be probably significant dislocations somewhere in the economy, perhaps the labor 
market, to get inflation all the way down from the very high levels it was at at the beginning of this episod e.  That didn’ t happen.  T hat’s a tremendous result .  We’re very , of course , gratified 
and pleased that that hasn ’t happened.  And, if you look at the dynamics that enabled that, it 
really was that  this, the—that so much of the gain was from the unwinding of things that weren ’t 
to do with monetary policy but  the unwinding of the distortions to the economy, you know, 
supply problems —supply- side problems and also some , some  demand issues as well.  The 
unwinding of those really helped inflation come down.  Now, as I ’ve said, I ’m not giving up on 
that.  So I think —I think it is possible that , that  those forces will still work to help us bring 
inflation down.  We can ’t—we can’t  be guaranteed that that ’s true , though.  And so we ’re—you 
know, we’re  trying to use our tools in a way that keeps the labor market strong, and the economy 
strong, but also helps bring inflation back down to 2 percent sustainably.  We will bring inflation 
down to 2 percent sustainably .  We hope we can do it without , you know, without  significant 
dislocations in the labor market or elsewhere.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.   And speaking of dislocations in the labor market:  In 
terms of cutting , you said, if there were weakness in the job market , that could be a reason to cut 
rates.   So if the unemployment rate were to tick above 4 percent but inflation not back down to 
your 2 percent target, how would you look at that?   Would the unemployment rate popping back 
above 4 percent catch your attention?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I said “ an unexpected weakening”  is what I —the way I 
characterize d it.  So , you know —and I ’m not going to try to define exactly what I mean by that.  
But, you know , it would be —it would have to be meaningful and get our attention and lead us to 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 26  
 think that the labor market was really significantly weakening for us to want to react to it.  A 
couple of tenths in the unemployment rate would be —would probably not do that .  But a 
broader —it would be a broader thing that would —that would suggest that it would be 
appropriate to consider cutting.  I think whether you decide to cut will depend on all the facts and 
circumstances, not just that one.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Chair Powell, thanks for taking the question.  Kyle Campbell with 
American Banker.   You’ve said that broad and material changes are needed for the Basel  III 
Endgame proposal , and you’ ve mentioned that  a re-proposal is something that ’s on the table.  As 
you’ve had more time to sort of sit with the public commentary, process that, and understand the 
options available to you, do you have a better sense of whether a re- proposal will be necessary, 
and do you have a timeline in mind for when, you know, some sort of movement will be made on 
that front— either a re -proposal or a move to finalize?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So let me —let me start by saying that the F ed is committed to , you 
know, completing this process and carrying out Basel III E ndgame in a way that ’s faithful to 
Basel and also comparable to what the other large comparable jurisdictions are doing.  We 
haven’ t made any decisions on , on policy or on process at all .  Nothing.  Nothing.  N o decisions 
have been made.   I’ll say again , though, if we conclude that re -proposal is appropriate, we won’t  
hesitate to insist on that.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  And then do you need to resolve issues  with the capital proposal in 
order to advance other parts of the regulatory agenda , or do you expect to continue to make 
progress on those other agenda items?  Thank you. 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 25 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.  You know , there’s no mechanical rule in place there.  B ut I would say 
that the , you know, the  Basel III process is by far the most important thing and really is , I think , 
occupying us at this time in terms of what’ s, what’s —what we ’re moving ahead with.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Let’s go to Mark for the last question.  
MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you.  Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.  Mr. Chairman, what 
can you tell us about the approach that you take with your role in  the sense of trying to achieve 
consensus, which  you recently identified as a priority, while allowing for a range of views or 
even dissent ?  We don’ t see many dissenting votes in the official statements, even when more 
spirited discussions are noted in the minutes after the fact.  How do you avoid groupthink and 
avoid a higher risk of a policy mistake?   Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think if you listen to, and you all do, listen to my 18 colleagues 
on the FOMC, you’ ll see that we do not lack for a diversity of voices and perspectives.  We 
really don’ t.  And it ’s one of the great aspects of the Federal Reserve System.  We have 
12 R eserve Banks around the country where they have their own economic staff, not the people 
who work here at the Board.  T here are different people.  You know, and so each , each  Reserve 
Bank has its own culture around monetary policy and its own approach and that kind of thing.  It 
guarantees you a diversity of perspectives.  So I think that the  perspectives are very diverse.  
But—and, in terms of —in terms of dissents,  you know, we have dissents.  A nd, you 
know, a thoughtful dissent is a good thing, if someone really makes you think, that kind of thing.  But all I can say from my standpoint is I try —I listen carefully to people .  I try to incorporate 
their thinking or do everything I can to incorporate their thinking into what we ’re doing .  And I 
think many people , if they feel that’ s happening, you know, that  for most people most of the 
May 1, 2024 Chair Powell’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 26 of 26  
 time, that’ ll be enough.  A nd—but I ’m not —I mean , it’s, it’s not, you know, frowned upon or 
illegal or against the rules or anything like that.   It just is the way things come out . 
And I mean,  I think we have a very diverse group  of rounded people —frankly , more 
diverse than it used to be in many dimensions, more diverse from the obvious gender and 
demographic ways, but also we have more people who are not Ph.D . economists .  So we have 
people from business and law and academia and things like that.  So I think we actually do have quite a good diverse perspective.  I think all of us read these stories about the lack of diversity , 
and we look around the room and say, “ I don’ t understand.  I really don’ t understand what 
they’ re talking about.”   So—but I get the question, though.  Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell ’s Press Conference 
June 12 , 2024 
 
CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of 
the American people.  Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the 
past two years.  The labor market has come into better balance, with continued strong job gains and a low unemployment rate.  Inflation has eased substantially from a p eak of 7 percent to 
2.7 percent but is still too high.  We are strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2  percent 
goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.  
Today, the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to 
reduce our securities holdings.  We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.  I ’ll have more to say 
about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.  
Although GDP growth moderated from 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.3 percent in the first quarter, private domestic final purchases —which excludes inventory 
investment, government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal on underlying demand—grew at 2.8 percent in the first quarter, nearly as strong as the second half of 2023.  Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last ye ar’s robust pace but remains 
solid.  And investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.  Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to slow from last year’ s pace, with a median 
projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2.0 percent over the next two years. 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 2 of 27  
 In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.  
Payroll job gains averaged 218,000 jobs per month in April and May, a pace that is still strong 
but a bit below that seen in the first quarter.  The unemployment rate ticked up but remains low  
at 4 percent.  Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 years and a continued strong pace of imm igration.  Nominal wage growth has eased over 
the past year , and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad set of indicators 
suggests that conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic —relatively tight but not overheated.  FOMC participants expect la bor market 
strength to continue.  The median unemployment rate projection in the SEP is 4.0 percent at the end of this year and 4.2 percent at the end of next year.  
Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal 
of 2 percent.  Total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in April; excluding 
the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 perce nt.  The c onsumer price 
index—which came out this morning and tends to run higher than the PCE , PCE  price index—
rose 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the core CPI rose 3.4 percent.  The 
inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat.  Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.6  percent this year, 2.3 percent next year, and 2.0 percent in 2026. 
My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as 
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 3 of 27  
 like food, housing, and transportation.  Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual 
mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’ s meeting to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.  As 
labor market tightness has eased and inflation has declined over the past year, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals ha ve moved toward better balance.  The economic 
outlook is uncertain, however, and we remain highly attentive to inflation risks.  
We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the 
federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  So far this year, the data have not given us that g reater confidence.  The most 
recent inflation readings have been more favorable than earlier in the year, however, and there has been modest further progress toward our inflation objective.  We will need to see more good 
data to bolster our confidence t hat inflation is moving sustainably toward 2  percent.  
We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of 
the progress that we ’ve seen on inflation.  At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or 
too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully ass ess 
incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.  If the economy evolves as expected, the median par ticipant 
projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 5.1 percent at the end of this year, 4.1 percent at the end of 2025, and 3.1 percent at the end of 2026.  But these projections are 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 4 of 27  
 not a Committee plan or any kind of a decision.  As the economy evolves, assessments of the 
appropriate policy, policy path will adjust in order to best promote our maximum -employment 
and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains solid and inflation persists, we ’re prepared to 
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.  If the labor 
market were to weaken unexpectedly or if inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, 
we’re prepared to respond.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that 
we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.  We ’ll continue to make our decisions 
meeting by meeting, based on the totality of the data and its implications for the outlook and the balance of risks.  
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and 
stable prices.  We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stabi lity is essential to

Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Just wondering 
if you could walk me through the Committee ’s average inflation forecast —core PCE is now 
forecast to be 2.8 percent by the year -end.  It ’s already 2.75, and after today’ s number, there 
were several forecasts on the street that it would be 2.6 at the end of this month.  Does that tell 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 5 of 27  
 you that the average official expects no further progress in inflation a nd, in fact, that it ’s going to 
get worse?  And if you have this wrong, doesn’ t it mean that you sort of —you, you could have 
wrong the outlook for rates there?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  So what ’s going on there is that we had very low readings in 
the second half of last year —June through December, really.  And we ’re now lapping those.  So  
as you go through the 12 -month window, a very low reading drops out , and a new reading comes 
in.  The new reading gets added to the 12- month window.  So it’s just a, a  slight element of 
conservativism that we ’re, we’re  assuming a certain level of —of, you know, incoming monthly 
PCE and core PCE numbers.  We ’re assuming, you know, good, but not great , numbers.  And if 
you put that on top of where we are now, you get a very slight increase in the 12- month —in the 
12-month, you know, reading.  Now, do we have high confidence that that ’s right?  No.  It’ s just 
the kind of conservative way for forecasting things.  If we were to get more readings like today ’s 
reading, then, of course, that wouldn ’t be the case.  So it ’s just a forecasting device.  I think, I 
think—let me say that we welcome today ’s reading and then hope for more like that.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  But if it comes in —just to  follow  up—if it comes in the way you 
forecast it, it would  seem strange for you to be cutting rates at all in context of a rising core PCE.  
Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah —no.  I mean, I think we’ve, we’ve—what we said is that we 
don’t think it’ ll be appropriate to , to reduce rates and begin to loosen policy until we have more 
confidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent on a —on a  sustainable basis.  And 
that’s the—that’s the test we ’ve applied.  I don’ t know that —I think if we —I don’t know that 
this rules  that in or out.  I mean, really, it’s, it’s a forecast —a fairly conservative forecast month 
by month that would lead to slightly higher, you know, 12- months rates by the end of the year.  
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 6 of 27  
 If we get, you know, good—better readings  than that, then you will see that come down or , or 
remain the same.  If you ’re at 2.6, 2.7 [percent], you know, that ’s, that’s  a really good place to 
be. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal .  Chair Powell, if I look at 
the, the rate projections, I see 15 of the 19 that are anticipating either one or two cut —two cuts  
this year —fairly evenly split between the two.  And so I wonder if you could explain a little 
more the nuances or the differences there.  Would two or three more inflation readings like the 
one that we saw this morning make a September interest rate cut possible?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So as far as the SEP part of that is concerned —as you know, I talk 
to—I talk to  all of the other participants on the FOMC every cycle , and we talk about their 
Summary of E conomic P rojections and, and the  dot plot —and, you know, the ir dot plot and 
everything.  And what  you—what  I hear and see is that people are looking at, at, you know, a 
range of plausible outcomes.   And in many cases, they ’re—they’re  thinking, “ I don’ t really ”—
you know, “ I can ’t really distinguish between two of these.  They ’re so close for me. ”  These are 
very close calls, but we ask them to write down the most likely one —so they do.  And as, I think , 
you’ve, you’ve —as you’ ve said, there ’s 15 of the 19 are , are kind of clustered around one or 
two.  So I think I would look at , at all—I’d look at all  of them as plausible, but I ’d look at —so I 
think that does tell you kind of what the Committee thinks.  
But what everyone agrees on is , it’s going to be data dependent.  No one —no one  brings 
to this or takes away from it that is on the Committee a really strong commitment to a particular 
rate path.  It’ s actually just their forecast and  their—it’s a combination of their forecast and their 
own reaction function.  But, again, everyone would say that this is very data dependent, and I 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 7 of 27  
 don’t hold it with high confidence.  And I think if you’ re looking for —and , and don’ t really 
think that they ’re—they’re  not trying to send a strong signal that “ this is what I think is the right 
thing.”   It’s just what they think at a given moment in time , subject to data. 
In terms of, you know, future meetings, we haven’ t, you know —we don’ t—we don’t  try 
to—we don’t  make decisions about future meetings until we get there.  I think in terms of what 
we need to see, I mentioned it earlier —we, we want to —we want to  gain further confidence.  
Certainly, more good inflation readings will help with that.  I ’m not going to be specific about 
how many because, you know, really, it ’s going to be not just the inflation rating —readings —it’s 
going to be the totality of the data :  what ’s happening in the labor market, what ’s happening with 
the balance of risks, what ’s happening with the forecast, what ’s happening with growth.  You 
look at all of that, and you ask, “A re we confident?  Have we reached an appropriate level of 
confi dence that inflation is moving down sustainably to  2 percent , or, alternatively, do we see 
really unexpected signs of weakness in the labor market that would call for a response ?”—which 
is—which is another thing that could, could happen.  But, again, we don’ t see that.  And I —we 
do see today ’s—we see today’s report as, as  progress and as, you know, building confidence.  
But we , we don’ t see ourselves as having the confidence that would warrant —you know, that 
would warrant  beginning to, to loosen policy at this time.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  And if I could quickly follow up—did , did you or any of your 
colleagues change your interest rate projections after 8:30 or whenever you got the inflation 
numbers today?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  we—this happens too often, but it, it does happen.  It just is, you 
know —data came— I think it happened a couple of meetings ago—a few meetings ago.  So when 
that happens —when there ’s an important data print during the meeting, first day or second day—
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 8 of 27  
 what we do is , we, we make sure people remember that they have the ability to update.  We tell 
them how to do that.  And , and some people do;  some people don’ t.  Most , most  people don’ t.  
But I ’m not going to get into the specifics, but you have the ability to do that.  So that, you 
know —what ’s in the SEP actually does reflect the data that we got today to the extent you can, 
you know, reflect it in one day.  I think we ’ll, you know —you will see PPI tomorrow .  We’ll 
know more about the PCE [inflation] readi ng as the month goes on.  But the initial CPI reading 
and its, you know, kind of first -level translation to , to PCE  [inflation] we did have this morning.  
We were briefed about it , and people were able to consider whether they should make changes.  
And, as I said, you know, some people generally do, but most people generally don’ t. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jonnelle.  
JONNELLE MARTE.  Hi, Chair Powell.   Jonnelle Marte from Bloomberg.  As you 
noted, the labor market is now in many ways back to where it was before the pandemic.  I 
wondered if you could comment on how officials are viewing that .  So do you think that there 
still needs to be more cooling in the labor market to bring inflation all the way down to 2 percent , 
or is there any sense that maybe the labor market is more vulnerable now to higher rates now that 
many of those imbalances have eased? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So by, by so many measures, the labor market was, was  kind 
of overheated two years ago.  And we ’ve seen it gradually move back into much better balance 
between supply and demand.  So, what have we seen?  We ’ve seen labor force supply come up 
quite a bit through immigration and through recovering participation.  That ’s ongoing, mostly 
now through the im migration channel.  But still, we ’ve had some increases in prime -age labor 
force.   In terms of on the demand side, you know, we ’ve seen —well, we’ve seen quits moving 
down.  W e’ve seen job openings moving down.  W e’ve seen wage increases moving from very, 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 9 of 27  
 very high levels a couple of years ago back down to more sustainable levels.  We have seen 
unemployment creep up now sixth- tenths over the course of , of a year or so very, very gradually.  
So you put all that together —what you have is still -low unemployment, still 4 percent 
unemployment —historically low.  But it ’s moved up a little bit —it’s softened a bit —and, and, 
you know, that ’s an important statistic.  But , but more than that, you’ ve got strong job creation.  
You, you have payroll jobs still coming in strong, even though, you know, there ’s an argument 
that they may be a bit over stated but still they ’re, they’re still—they’re  strong.  So that ’s what we 
see.  We, we  watch the labor market, of course, and the economy as a whole —but the labor 
market very carefully —and that ’s what we see.  We see gradual cooling —gradual moving 
toward better balance.  We’re monitoring it carefully for signs of, of  something more than that, 
but we really don’ t see that.  
JONNELLE MARTE.  As a quick follow- up—t he surveys that make up the jobs report 
are, are  showing different tales.  There ’s been some divergence, especially , we saw , in the last 
report that we got on Friday.  So how do you interpret that , and, and how does it change your 
view on the labor market?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So sometimes it’s —you can ’t reconcile the differences.  Y ou just 
have to, have to —have to look at it and, and try to understand.  And that ’s why it always makes 
sense to look at a series, you know, in 6—in  3, 6, and 12 months of things rather than just one 
report.   But you’ re right to point to the last report, where it  was your —job losses in the  
household survey—job gains , big job gains in the establishment survey.  So, I mean, we ’re left 
with ambiguous results, and we have to deal with that uncertainty around data.  Nonetheless, the 
overall picture is one of a strong and gradually cooling—gradually rebalancing labor market.  Job openings, while they ’ve come way down, are still, you know, greater than the number of 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 10 of 27  
 unemployed people.  The jobs –workers gap is still a significantly positive number —greater than 
it was before the pandemic.  So , overall, we ’re looking at what i s still a very strong labor market 
but not the superheated labor market of two years ago or even one year ago. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil .  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin , with Axios.  Back on the rates path :  
The SEP showed quite a large shift of rate  cut expectations relative to March —that ’s a period in 
which the economic data flow hasn’ t been that dramatic a shift.  How, how —can you provide 
some color on what change d in the attitudes on the Committee over the last three months to , to 
see a much shallower path of rate cuts this year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah.  The big thing that changed was the inflation forecast.  So  the 
inflation forecast moved up several tenths for the end of the year.  And , and, as I mentioned 
earlier , in the, you know —what , what  did we take away from this?  We had really , really  good 
inflation data in the second half of last year, then kind of a pause in progress in the first quarter.  
And what we took away from that was that it ’s probably going to take longer to get the 
confidence that we need to begin to loosen policy .  So the sense of that is that rate cuts that might 
take place in —might ’ve taken place this year —take place next year, you know?   We, we—t here 
are—there are fewer rate cuts in the median this year, but there ’s one more next year.  So, so you 
really —if you look at year -end 2025 and ’ 26, you’ re, you’re  almost exactly where you would 
have been, just it —just it’ s moved later because of that progress.  Now, you get another —you 
get data —different data today.  So we ’ll have to see where the data light the way .  You know,  
we’re, we’re —the economy has, you know, repeatedly surprised forecasters in both directions, 
and today was certainly a better inflation report than almost anybody expected.  And we ’ll just 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 11 of 27  
 have to see what , what —what  the incoming data flow brings and, and how that affects the 
outlook and the balance of risks.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.  Thanks for taking our 
questions.  In the S ummary of E conomic P rojections, the long- run interest rate forecast moved 
up a bit.  I wonder if we should read that as a sign that you think that policy is not sort of as 
restrictive as we ’ve previously expected.  You know, how should we interpret what that means 
about how the Committee views its current policy setting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So two things about that —one , one  is this —you’ re right, it did move 
up.  B ut, but I want to remember to point out that the long -run neutral rate of interest is , is a 
long- run concept.  It , it really is a theoretical concept —can ’t be directly observed.  And what it is 
is the , the interest rate that would hold the economy at equilibrium— maximum employment and 
price stability —potentially, potentially  years in the future where there are no shocks.  So it’s—
it’s a little bit —it’s not something we observe today.  Today we ’ve got a very specific economy 
with all kinds of shocks we ’re still getting over from the pandemic.  So it’s—I, I don ’t think that 
the, the concept of r -star—it’s a very important concept in economics and in what we do.  B ut, 
honestly, it doesn’ t really get you where you need to be to think about what appropriate policy is 
in the near term.  
But I, I —back to your original question , people have been gradually writing it up because 
I just think people are coming to the view that rates are n’t—are less likely to go down to their , 
their pre-pandemic levels, which were , you know, very low by recent history measures.  Now, 
we, we can’t really know that.  That ’s, that’s  an interesting dispute and discussion to have now, 
but, ultimately, we think that things like the neutral rate are driven by longer -run, slow -moving 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 12 of 27  
 forces.  And, you know, there ’s a really good question about whether , whether  those really have 
changed or whether , instead, rates and the economy are experiencing a , a series of persistent but, 
ultimately, temporary shocks.  That ’s been the debate, and we can ’t know.  But in the meantime, 
we’re making policy with the economy that we have —with the distortions that we have.  And  I, I 
also—to your other point, I , I think it is —it is the case that as time has gone by, the question of 
“How restrictive is policy?” has become one that everyone ’s asking, and we ’re asking it , too.  
And, you know, my answer has been that policy is restrictive.  The question of whether it ’s 
sufficiently restrictive is going to be one we , we know over time.  But I think for the reasons I ’ve 
talked about at the last press conference and , and  other places, I think the evidence is pretty clear 
that policy is restrictive and is having, you know, the effects that we would hope for.  
MICHELLE SMITH. Howard.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thanks, Chair Powell .  Howard Schneider , with Reuters.  Just 
to—just to carry that a little further, should we read this as a conclusion that the combination of 
tipping to one cut this year and acknowledging further progress on inflation as kind of a mark to 
market on the level of restrictiveness that you need—that you, in fact, have concluded that you weren ’t quite there yet?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I’d be reluctant to try to draw that conclusion.  I , I think this is about, 
you know, looking at the incoming data and asking, “H ow much progress are we making on 
inflation, and how is the rest of the economy doing?  I s the labor market still strong? ”  That ’s 
what we ’re thinking about .  You know, you can—you can translate it into the —into the language 
you’re talking about , but, to me, the focus is more on, we have a goal, which is price stability, 
and an other goal, which is maximum employment.  How are we doing there?  We think we ’ve 
got a good, strong labor market still.  We think we ’ve been making progress toward the price -
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 13 of 27  
 stability goal.  And then for a while , there was a pause.  A nd we look at today’ s thing, and we 
think, “W ell, that ’s a good reading, and we hope we get more like that. ”  And, you know, in the 
meantime, we’ re asking , “Is our policy stance about right? ”  And I think we think, “Y es, it ’s 
about right.”   We’ re prepared to adjust that as appropriate, but we think— we think we ’re getting 
the things that we would want to get , broadly speaking.  And that ’s why we ’ve been at this 
policy r ate now for almost a year.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So, so just to follow up on that —I think one , one  curious 
thing here is , you’ ve got now this restrictive policy in place and virtually no change in any of the 
major things for all of this year.  You ’ve got growth that stays above long- run potential 
throughout the forecast period, unemployment that never goes above the long- run estimate —
right ?—of 4.2.  So this isn’ t a story of slack improving inflation.   So where ’s the improvement in 
inflation coming from that it’ s going to pick up pace so much in 2025?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, it’s been coming —where’s it been coming from —
let’s start with that.  You know, clearly a lot of what —some of what we’ ve been getting is just 
the reversal of the —the unwinding of the pandemic -related distortions to both supply and 
demand.  And that is, you know —that is complemented by and amplified —supported by 
restrictive monetary policy.  So those two things have been working together.  We ’ve also had a 
very positive supply shock on the labor side. And, and, also, you get —you  get a positive supply 
shock when the —when the  supply conditions unwind and return to normal.  So  you’ ve had, you 
know, above -trend potential growth and , and high growth.  And yet you’ ve had the benefit of , of 
inflation coming down, you know, really fast, actually, last year, and you will see what the rest 
of this year brinks —brings.  So these dynamics can continue as long as they continue.  I mean, 
ultimately, the question is , ultimately, are you down to demand?  And , and we don’ t know that, 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 14 of 27  
 though.  I mean, look at today’ s report .  You know , if we see more like that —you know, we 
don’t —we can ’t know what the future holds.  But in the meantime, we ’ve made pretty good 
progress on inflation with our current stance.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Mike.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  The base 
case of the Committee seems to be that there is going to be at least one rate cut this year, but 
your growth forecast doesn’ t see any slowdown in the rest of the year , nor does the 
unemployment forecast see any significant weakening of the labor market.  And your inflation forecasts basically average out to no change.  So if , at the end of the year , there is no change 
from conditions now, why would you anticipate cutting rates?  Wh at, what  would be the point 
for a rate cut? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, we think —we think policy is restrictive.  And we think, 
ultimately, that if you—if you just set policy at a restrictive level, eventually you will see real 
weakening in the economy.  So that ’s always been the thought is that, you know, since we raise 
rates this far, we’ ve, we’ve  always been pointing to cuts at a certain point.  Not to eliminate the 
possibility of hikes, but, you know, no one has that as their base case , so—no one on the 
Committee does.  But so that ’s, that’s —you know, that ’s how we think about it.  And that ’s what 
we’ve been getting.  That ’s what we ’ve been getting is good progress on inflation, with growth at 
a—at a, a good level  and with a strong labor market.  Now, ultimately, we think rates will have 
to come down to continue to support that.  But, so far, they haven’ t had to.  And, you know, 
that’s why we ’re watching so carefully for signs of weakness.  We don’ t really see that.  We kind 
of see what we wanted to see, which was gradual cooling in demand —gradual rebalancing in the 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 15 of 27  
 labor market while we ’re continuing to make progress on inflation.  So we ’re getting —we’re 
getting good results here.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  But , to follow up :  Is there any kind of concern for the housing 
industry or financial stability —banks —in leaving rates where they are for too long at this point?  
CHAIR POWELL.  On housing—you know, the housing situation is a complicated one.  
And you can see that ’s a place where rates are really having , having a significant effect.  I mean, 
ultimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so that we 
can bring rates down so that the housing market can continue to normalize.  There will still be a national housing shortage , as there was before the pandemic. There will still be one, but the 
distortions that we see now with lock -ins and things like that —you know, low mortgages —in 
terms of banks, the banking system has been, you know, solid, strong, well capitalized.  Lending—y ou know, we ’ve seen good performance by the banks.  We had the turmoil earlier 
last year , but, you know, banks have been focusing on bringing up their li quidity, bringing up 
their capital, and having a risk— risk-management plans in place.  So the banking system, you 
know, seems to be —seems to be in good shape.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Thanks .  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  I was 
wondering if we can read—on inflation, if you can tell us a little more about where you see inflationary pressure in the economy.  You mentioned labor markets coming into better balance, and inflation expectations appear to be well anchored.  You ’re seeing, you know, anecdotal 
stories of , the large chains like Walmart and Target are announcing price cuts—McDonald ’s 
announcing a $5 meal deal.  So people may still be unhappy about prices  at the grocery store, but 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 16 of 27  
 it doesn ’t seem like there ’s a lot of inflationary pressure left in this economy —and wonder if you 
could tell us more about that.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  I, I think it ’s true that housing—that inflationary pressures have 
come down.  But we still have—we ’re still getting high inflation readings.  So, you know —and I 
think you can see it in, in  various places in —you know, in some parts of , of nonhousing services.   
You see elevated inflation still—and that ’s probably to do with—it could be to do with wages.  
Goods prices have kind of fluctuated.  There ’s been a surprising increase in , in import prices on 
goods, which is kind of hard to understand.  And, you know, may , may —we’ve taken some 
signal from that, but, you know —and, and, of course, housing services.  You ’re seeing —you’re 
continuing to see high readings there to some extent.  That ’s, that’s, you know, catch- up inflation 
from earlier pressures.  But, I mean, overall, you ’re right.  Inflationary pressures have come 
down.  As I mentioned, the labor market has come into better balance.  Wages are still running, 
you know, I would say, above a , a sustainable path, which would be that of trend inflation and 
trend productivity.  You ’re still seeing wage increases moving above that.  We, we haven ’t 
thought of wages as being the principal , you know, cause of inflation.  But at the same time, 
getting back to 2 percent inflation is likely to require a return to a more sustainable level, which 
is somewhat below the current level of increases in the aggregate.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post .  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  There ’s obviously a lot of focus on how many cuts could be expected 
this year.  But can you give us a sense of what one cut by the end of the year would actually do 
to the economy—what you think would be a meaningful difference  if there was a cut by the end 
of the year or even two?  
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 17 of 27  
 CHAIR POWELL.  I think if, you know —if you look back in 5 or 10 years and , and try 
to pull out the significance to the U .S. economy of one 25 bas is point rate cut, you’ d, you’d have 
quite a job on your hands.  So  that’s not how we look at it —you know , really, the whole rate 
path matters.  And I , I do continue to think that when—you know, when we do start to loosen 
policy, that will show up in a  significant loosening in  financial market conditions.  And the 
market will price in what it prices in.   I don’t —I have no way of saying— we’re, we ’re not at that 
stage, so I don’ t know what we ’ll be thinking about at that time.  But it ’s a consequential 
decision for the economy.  And, you know, you want to—you want to get it right.  And , 
fortunately, we have a strong economy, and we , we have the ability to, you know, approach this 
question carefully.  And we will approach it carefully while we ’re very much keeping an eye on, 
you know, downside economic risks , should they —should they emerge.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And you ’ve been talking about this clear sense that it ’s just going to 
take longer to have the confidence that ’s needed for rate cuts.   Is there something about what 
happened in the first couple of months of the year that you ’re seeing differently now with more 
time or hindsight?  Do you still characterize it as expected bumpiness or something more lasting 
that is affecting your policy for the rest of the year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we always want to avoid the tendency to dismiss the 
parts of inflation that we —that we don ’t like and just make it go away.  So —but we had a 
quarter where inflation was running higher , and, yes, I could stand here and say, “I t’s stuff we 
shouldn’ t have taken signal from.”   But it is what it is .  You know, you, you have to —you know, 
low inflation is low inflation .  High—so i f you have a quarter where it ’s higher —we tried not to 
take signal from the first couple of months, but we got a third month, and we said, “Okay, the 
signal we ’re taking is that, you know, we think it ’s going to take longer to get confidence  that 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 18 of 27  
 inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.”  That ’s, that’s what we said.  I think that was 
the right thing to do.  I still think that’ s the right thing to do.  Now we have today ’s inflation 
reading, which is very different —very much more positive.  We’re going to have to see what the 
trend is —what ’s, what’s  going to be the data going forward.  We’ re looking for something that 
gives us confidence that inflation is , is moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  And readings like 
today’ s, you know —that ’s a step in the right direction.  But, you know, one reading is —isn’t— it 
just—it’s  only one reading.  You don’ t want to —you don’t want to be too motivated by any 
single data point.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Jo Ling.  
JO LING KENT.   Hi, Chair Powell.   Thank you for taking our questions.  I ’m Jo Ling 
Kent , with CBS News.  What ’s your message to Americans who are seeing encouraging 
economic data  but don ’t feel good about this economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I, you know —I, I don’ t think anyone knows —has a definitive answer 
why people are , are not as happy about the economy as they might be.  And we don’ t tell people 
how they should think or feel about the economy.  That ’s not our job.  We —you know, people 
experience what they experience.  All I can tell you is what the —what the  data show, which is , 
we’ve got an economy that ’s growing at a solid pace.  W e’ve got a very strong labor market with 
unemployment at 4 percent.  It ’s been a long time sinc e we’ve had, you know, a long stretch of 
time with unemployment at or below 4 percent— very long time.  We had a period of high 
inflation.   We—inflation has come down really significantly, and we ’re doing everything we can 
to—you know, to bring that inflationary episode fully to a halt and fully restore price stability.   
We’re confident that we ’ll get there.  And in the meantime, you know, it ’s going to be painful 
for, for people , but the ultimate pain would be a, a period of  long, high—a long period of high 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 19 of 27  
 inflation.   It is people who—lower -income people —people who are at the margins of the 
economy who, who have the worst experience— who experience the most pain from inflation.  
So, you know, it ’s for those people —for all Americans , but particularly for those people —that 
we’re doing everything we can to bring inflation back down under control. 
JO LING KENT.  As just a quick follow -up here —you’ ve indicated one interest rate cut 
sometime this year.  And I know you don’ t have a crystal ball up there , but a lot of people are 
watching and see, you know, borrowing money remains very expensive.  For everybody who’ s 
out there waiting on a rate cut, about when can consumers expect some relief?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, you know, I , I don’ t have a precise date for you.  But what we 
said is that we , we want to make sure that we ’re confident that inflation is actually moving back 
down to 2 percent.  And when we are, then we can look at loosening policy.  So having that kind 
of confidence that inflation will be at 2 percent  just—it just pays benefits to the whole economy, 
to all Americans, for a long period of time.  We had that period for a very long time .  We very 
much want to get back to a place where people can , can  not think about inflation—i t’s just not a 
concern in the everyday economic decisions that they make.  We were ther e for a long time , and 
our goal is to get back to that place.  And we ’ve made good progress , and we ’re just —we ’re in 
the phase now of just, you know, sticking with it until we get it done.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Claire.  
CLAIRE JONES.  Claire Jones, Financial Times.   I’m just drawing on the change in the 
statement on there being “modest further progress ” on inflation.  You know, halfway, you know,  
through the year and after today ’s CPI release, you know, what have you and other Committee 
members found that has been particularly encouraging to you?  And just in terms of the 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 20 of 27  
 conservatism, how much of that is about stickiness and shelter inflation in particular?  
Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, encouraging has been that growth— you know, the growth, 
clearly , that we had last year, particularly the second half of last year, and we continue to see 
still-strong growth —solid growth this year.  That ’s been very encouraging.  If you go back a 
year, there was a real concern about, you know, very much slowing growth and, and a recession —many forecasters had that.   And that ’s not what happened.  Instead, we —the U.S. is , 
anyway, and it ’s in—it’s in sharp distinction with many other advanced economies around the 
world.  So that ’s been encouraging.  I would say that the , the—today’ s inflation report is 
encouraging, but it comes after, you know, several reports that were not so encouraging. 
You asked about —your second question was really about shelter inflation.   So I think if 
you go back a couple of years —we, we know that there were renters , and then there  are, you 
know, people who own their houses .  And we have OER, which is owners ’ equivalent rent.  And 
so when market -based rents go up sharply, as they did at the beginning of the —of the—when the 
economy reopened, they really went up sharply.  Those play into rollover rents much more 
slowly for existing tenants than they do for new tenants.  And , and so  what we —so we, we ’ve 
found now that there are big lags.  So  there ’s sort of  a—there’s  a bulge of high past increases in , 
in market rents.   It has to get worked off , and that may take, you know, several years.   
Nonetheless, as long as market rents remain —are going at —up at relatively low levels —and 
they still are —you know, this , this  is just going to happen.  It just is going to happen more slowly 
than we thought. 
You know, we , we also do sort of this thing where we impute a rental value to , to owned 
homes.  And that ’s—you know, many countries around the world do that.  Some do it differently 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 21 of 27  
 than us.  It ’s something that the —you know, that the , the price experts have regularly looked at.  
It is not something that we ’re the only country that does, and it ’s not something we ’re looking at 
changing or would look at changing, you know, anytime soon.  But it—it’ s true.  It ’s one of the 
very hardest things in, in inflation and in prices is how to think about, you know, the services 
that someone is getting by living in a home that they could rent, but they ’re actually living in it.   
And some countries —you should just ignore that.  But that ’s not our —that’s not how we do 
inflation here.  We, we  do it the way we do it , and we ’ve been very transparent about it.  And, 
you know, it ’s true that we ’re—we’re seeing delays in , in realizing what —what ’s happening 
economically .  But we understand that —you know, we understand that very well.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Edward Lawrence, with Fox Business.  Thank you for taking 
the question, Chair Powell.  So I want to go back to jobs and the consumer.  The last jobs report 
show ed that over the past year, 634,000 more people took multiple jobs.  That ’s up 8.2 percent.  
And since January of 2021, we ’ve seen prices rise 19 percent.  So people are using their credit 
cards to pay for their lifestyle.  What pressure points will signal to you that the slowing economy 
could maybe break companies in terms of hiring or break the consumer in terms of spending?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, we monitor all the things you mentioned and more .  
You know , what we ’re seeing is, basically , spending was going up faster than disposable income 
during big parts of next year , so—last year, rather —and so what  that—you’d expect to see is 
people spending more on their credit cards .  That —that has been happening.  Credit card 
balances have been going up.  C redit card defaults have been going up.  T hey’re not at high 
levels.   Remember that after the pandemic, people were cooped up.  T hey couldn’ t spend money.  
They couldn ’t go out to spend money ; they could spend money from home .  But households 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 22 of 27  
 were in very, very strong —historically strong —financial shape.  They ’ve now worked off a lot 
of that.  So  we’re, we’re  watching that carefully.  And, you know, what do we see?  That ’s what 
we see.  We, we  see the same data that everybody else sees, but you ’ve still got a household 
sector that ’s in—that’s in  pretty good shape .  You know —but , nonetheless, it ’s not in the kind of 
shape it was in a year or two ago.  And we ’re, you know —we ’re carefully watching that.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  So how close  then are we to that point where the consumer 
can’t continue to spend as it’s spending or companies can ’t hire like they ’re hiring?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So consumer spending is still growing.  It ’s not growing at the pace it 
was growing at a year or so ago, but , but it’s still —it’ s still growing solidly.  And, by the way, 
other parts of the economy are picking up.  Spending on equipment and intangibles is —has 
picked up quite a bit, you know, in the wake of all the construction that we saw of new tech—
you know, tech plants.  So, overall, the economy is exhibiting solid growth, and, you know —
something around 2 percent —which is —which is, you know, good—a good pace of growth for 
the U.S. economy.  But , no, you’ re, you’re  right, though.  We, we  do see the same thing other 
people see, which is, you know, increasing financial pressures on, you know, more lower -income 
people.  And, and, you know, the best thing we can do is , is to foster a very strong jobs economy, 
which we think we have done —ultimately to get inflation under control , because those people 
experience inflation, you know, very directly —very painfully.  And, and, you know, once , once  
we get inflation under control, rates can come down—which , which will also improve things.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  You ’ve mentioned that 
unexpected weakening in the labor market would, would bring rate cuts sooner.  And I was just 
wondering —can you talk a little bit about what that would look like?  Is it more of, like , a 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 23 of 27  
 quicker pace of people losing jobs?   Is it more the level of the unemployment rate if it were to 
start to go above 4.2 or something like that?  How are you thinking about what you’ re looking 
for to see the job market unexpectedly weaken?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know —you know, when I say “ unexpectedly,”  the first thing is  
more than , kind of , is in our forecast or in common forecasts —so, something more than that .  
But we ’ll be looking at everything.  Y ou know , we’ll— the, the labor market, you know, has the 
ability —has , has the tendency sometimes to , to weaken quickly.  So waiting for that to happen is , 
is not what we ’re doing.  You know, we ’re watching very carefully ; we’re looking at the balance 
of risks.  I always point out the balance of risks , so—and, and also the fact that we look at , at all 
of it— the whole situation.  So, you know, a decision to begin to—you know, to loosen policy 
could have several reasons associated with it at a given time.  But I, you know, I would just —
you know, we monitor all the —all the labor market data.  A nd if we saw troubling—weakening 
more than —more than expected, then that would be something we ’d consider responding to.  B ut 
we’d look at the —we look at the  broader context of what ’s going on, too.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.   So something like negative payroll numbers would be — 
CHAIR POWELL.  I ’m not going to —yeah, I mean, I , I can think of things that would—
many things would make it on that list, but I don ’t think I ’ll, I’ll utter them here.  
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovitch with t he 
Economist.  May I ask —you mentioned, with the slightly higher PCE  [inflation] readings earlier 
this year , that it wasn ’t one or two months but three months that tipped you to be a bit more 
cautious in the rate outlook.  Should we take from that  that—you know, it looks like May will be 
quite good for PC E [inflation ], as it was for CPI —does that imply that kind of two more good 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 24 of 27  
 months would reinstill the confidence that rate cuts could be coming sooner than you currently 
project?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I , I don’ t actually have that kind of mechanical thing in, 
in my thinking.  I , I get that, you know —as many good ones as we had bad ones —but it ’s not 
like that.  It’s the whole.  It’s going to be the totality of the data —[including] l abor market data , 
the growth data .  In terms of inflation, you know, you’ d, you’d want to see real progress that 
builds your confidence that we’re —that we are on a path down to 2 percent.  And I , I don’ t want 
to try to give you specific numbers of things , because that points to dates , and I , I just don’ t 
think—we ’re not at a point of being able to do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Kosuke. KOSUKE TAKAMI.  Thank you for doing this.  I, I am Kosuke Takami , with Nikkei.   I 
would like to know about the impact of a stronger dollar on U.S. economic growth and prices.  
And I have no doubt that markets should determine the exchange rate, but in —Japan and some 
emerging market s are suffering from  the strong d ollar.  So  I want to know if it is having a 
positive impact on U.S. economy in total?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.   So we don’ t—actually , it’s our —it’s our  finance ministry , the 
Treasury Department , that has a responsibility for thinking about and , and, if it sees fit, doing 
things about the level of the dollar.  So for us, it ’s just another financial variable.  And you’ re 
right —the dollar has been—has exhibited, exhibited some strength over the course of the last 
year or so because the U.S. economy is very strong.  We don’ t think of it as benefiting or hurting 
the U.S.  We don’ t—again, we don’ t manage the level of the dollar.  That ’s, that’s not our —
that’s not our job.  It ’s not .  You know —and for , for our economy, what , you know, we ’re trying 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 25 of 27  
 to foster is maximum employment and price stability.  And we feel like we’ ve made good 
progress on, on  both of those goals over the course of the past year.  
MICHELLE SMITH.   Jennifer.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger , with 
Yahoo Finance.  You said you would cut rates before inflation falls to 2 percent.  You ’re 
forecasting inflation to end the year at 2.8 percent on core PCE .  We’re at 2.8 percent, of course, 
on core PCE.  Right now, you said the inflation forecast is conservative and that if you got to 
2.6 to 2.7 [percent] on PCE  [inflation], that would be  a good place to be.  You also indicated the 
job market has mostly normalized.  So  why not cut rates this summer j ust once —you’ re well 
above neutral —to try to preserve the soft landing rather than risking waiting too long in  the quest 
for confidence for inflation?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know —so we are—we ’re well aware of the two -sided risks 
here, let me just say.  We, we understand that if we wait too long, that could come at the cost of 
economic activity, of employment, of the expansion.  We understand that if we move too, too quickly, we could end up undoing a lot of the good that we ’ve done and have to then start over, 
and it c ould be very disruptive.  So  we’re, we’re  extremely aware of both of those risks and , and 
just basically trying to manage them.  And what we sa id is that we’ll —that we’re —we don’ t 
think it ’ll be appropriate to , to begin to loosen policy until we ’re more confident that inflation is 
moving down to 2 percent over time on a sustainable basis.  That’s —that’s kind of been our test.  
Or there ’s another test, which is, you know, an unexpected deterioration in labor market 
conditions.  So I think that’ s, that’s  the right way for us to think about it.  That’s our —that’s our  
dual mandate there.  And, you know, we , we have a strong economy.  W e’ve got growth—all 
forecasts are very commonly around 2 percent.  That ’s a— that’s a  strong growth rate for our 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 26 of 27  
 economy.  The labor market continues to print jobs at a pretty high rate.  Unemployment  is still 
low.  So  we have the ability  now  to approach this question carefully, and that ’s, that’s  what 
we’re doing.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  And just  to follow, Chair Powell —do you need to be 
ahead of a weakening in the labor market?  Otherwise, is it too late , given that the labor market is 
a lagging indicator —right ?—when you look at the monthly jobs data?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, we,  we completely understand that that’ s the risk.  And that ’s, 
that’s not what we’re —that’s not our plan is to wait for things to break and then try to fix them.  
We’re, we’re  trying to balance these two goals in a way that is consistent with our framework , 
and we think we ’re doing that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Evan. 
EVAN RYSER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Evan Ryser with Market News International.  
You have mentioned before the framework review process will start in the latter half of the year.  
At this point, do you have any specific time  frame for the start of that?  Who will lead it?  Will 
you be —will it be you or a member —a C ommittee group of your —of your  peers?  What will be 
the parameters?  Do you anticipate the review will consider changes in communications going 
forward?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So  we—what, what we ’ve been thinking is that we would announce 
and commence the review later or late in the year.   In the meantime, as that time approaches, we 
will be devoting a lot of careful thought and planning to the contours of it.  Within scope would certainly be communications generally.  I —I’m not going to say that we ’ll look at this or that 
particular thing.  And all the other details, you know —we ’re just —we don’ t want to get 
June 12, 2024   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
 
Page 27 of 27  
 prematurely into a conversation until it’ s really time to have it.   And so, you know, I ’m going to 
leave pretty much everything else to, to later in the year.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Go to Nancy, for the last question.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer , with 
Marketplace.  Just one more question on housing —can you still cut rates with shelter prices high , 
or will you wait until they start to moderate a bit?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I wouldn’ t—there isn ’t any one thing— one variable , like housing 
prices moderating , that would really decide or decide against what we’ re doing.  We’ ve got an 
overall test, which is greater confidence that inflation is moving down to 2 percent on a 
sustainable basis.   That ’s our overall test.  Or , alternatively, we see unexpected weakening in the 
labor market.  So those  are—those are two different tests.  I would say, you know, we ’re not —
we’re not looking at any one price in any one sector and saying, “ That’s the one.”  We don’ t 
target housing prices, for example.  And we  don’t target wages.  We, we  target aggregate prices 
and overall employment, so— 
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  But if housing prices remain sticky, could that slow 
down the pace of rate cuts?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think you’ d look at the over —we ’d be looking at the aggregate 
numbers and, and asking ourselves, “What ’s going on here with inflation in the —at the 
aggregate level? ”  And, you know —and, of course, if, if—any price that contributed to ongoing 
inflation would , would matter .  Any price that contributed to ongoing disinflation would matter , 
too, but I wouldn’ t single out housing as having a , a special role there.  
Thank you very much.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference 
July 31, 2024 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of 
the American people.  Our economy has made considerable progress toward both goals over the 
past two years.   The labor market has come into better balance , and the unemployment rate 
remains low.   Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to 2.5 percent.   We are 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal in support of a strong economy that benefits everyone.  
Today, the F OMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue to 
reduce our securities holdings.  We are maintaining our restrictive stance of monetary policy in order to keep demand in line with supply and reduce inflationary pressures.  We are att entive to 
risks on both sides of our dual mandate, and I will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid 
pace.   GDP growth moderated to 2.1 percent in the first half of the year, down from 3.1 percent 
last year.   Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP—which excludes inventory investment, 
government spending, and net exports and usually sends a clearer signal of  underlying demand—
grew at a 2.6 percent pace over that same period, the first half.  Growth of consumer spending has slowed from last year’s robust pace but remains solid.  Investment in equipment and 
intangibles has picked up from its anemic pace last year.   In the housing sector, investment 
stalled in the second quarter after a strong rise in the first.   Improving supply conditions have 
supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.  
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 2 of 25  
 In the labor market, supply and demand conditions have come into better balance.  
Payroll job gains averaged 177,000 jobs per month in the second quarter —a solid pace, but 
below that seen in the first quarter.   The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 
4.1 percent.  Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an 
increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in participation among individuals aged 
25 to 54 years and a strong pace of immigration.   Nominal wage growth has eased over the past 
year, and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad set of indicators suggests that 
conditions in the labor market have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic —strong, but not overheated. 
Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains somewhat above our 
longer -run goal of 2 percent.  Total PCE prices rose 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in 
June; excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 
2.6 percent.   Longer -term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a 
broad range of surveys of households and businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.  
My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as 
it erodes purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for t he American people.  In 
support of these goals, the Committee decided at today’s meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 ¼ to 5½ percent and to continue reducing our securities holdings.  As 
the labor market has cooled and infla tion has declined, the risks to achieving our employment 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 3 of 25  
 and inflation goals continue to move into better balance.  Indeed, we ’re attentive to the risks to 
both sides of our dual mandate.  
We’ve stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the 
federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably 
toward 2 percent.  The second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence.  We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.  We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much 
could result in  a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation.  At the same time, reducing 
policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In 
considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  
As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our 
maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains solid and inflation 
persists, we can maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate as long as appropriate.   
If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandat e. 
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and 
stable prices.   We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to 
keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  Restoring price stabi lity is essential to 
achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.  Our success in 
delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.   We understand that our actions affect 
communities, families, and businesses across the country.   Everything we do is in service to our 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 4 of 25  
 public mission.  We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum -employment 
and price -stability goals.  Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.   Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times.  T hanks for taking our 
questions.  Markets pretty much entirely expect a rate cut in September at this stage.  I wonder if 
you think that ’s a reasonable expectation , and, if so, why not just make the move today?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Thank you.  S o on September, let me say this .  We, we have made no 
decisions about future meetings , and that includes the September meeting.  The broad sense of 
the C ommittee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to 
reduce our policy rate.  In that, we will be data dependent but not data point dependent, so it will 
not be a question of responding specifically to one or two data releases.  The question will be 
whether the totality of the data, the ev olving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with 
rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market.  If that test is met, a 
reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.  
So you asked, why not today?  And I would just say, again, that the broad sense of the 
Committee is that we ’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our 
policy rate but that we ’re not quite at that point yet.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  So just to, to follow  up on that a bit , if inflation behaves as 
you expect between now and September, would you regard a cut in September as sort of the baseline scenario right now?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I guess I would—I would think about it this way .  I’ll give an 
example of , of cases in which it would be appropriate to cut and maybe that it wouldn’ t be

 appropriate to cut.  So if we were to see, for example, inflation moving down quickly or more or 
less in line with expectations, growth remains , let’s say , reasonably strong, and the labor market 
remains , you know, consistent with its current condition, then I would think that a , a rate cut 
could be on the table at the September meeting.  
If, if inflation were to prove , you know, sticky and we were to see higher readings from 
inflation, disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with the other things.  You know, I 
think it ’s going to be not just any one thing.  I t’s going to be the inflation data , it’s going to be 
the employment data , it’s going to be the balance of risks as we see it —it’s going to be the 
totality of all of that that would help us make this decision.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  And just to follow  up on that —specifically , in what ways 
right now, given all you’ ve seen over the last few months, in particular on shelter, on services, et 
cetera, in what ways are you not confident right now that inflation is on the way back to 
2 percent?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I, I think it ’s just a question of seeing more good data.  We have 
seen—the last couple of readings have , have  certainly added to confidence .  And we ’ve seen 
progress across all three categories of core PCE inflation —that’s goods , nonhousing services , 
and housing services.  So it ’s really just—you know, we had a quarter of poor inflation data at 
the beginning of the year .  Then we saw some more good inflation data ; we had seven months at 
the end of last year.  You know, w e just want to see mo re and , and gain confidence .  And, as I 
said, we have—we did gain confidence , and more good data would cause us to, to gain more 
confidence.  
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.   Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 6 of 25  
 COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   The March  SEP 
pointed to three cuts in 2024, with core inflation at 2.6 percent and the unemployment rate at 
4 percent.  Since we’ re now at that level in terms of inflation and already beyond what was 
projected for the labor market, I ’m just wondering if that rate path is back to being the best 
guidepost for policy rather than, let’s say , the shallower one laid out in that June SEP. 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, s o I would just say, really, the path ahead is going to 
depend on the way the economy evolves.  And I can’ t really give you any, any better forward 
guidance on it than that.  We didn’ t, of course, do an SEP at this meeting.  We will do another 
one at the September meeting.  I would just say, I can —I can  imagine a scenario in which there 
would be everywhere from zero cuts to several cuts, depending on the way the economy evolves , 
and I wouldn’ t want to lay out a baseline path for you there today.  I ’ve said what I —what I  can 
say about September and about today , though. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos  of the Wall Street Journal.   Chair Powell, you ’ve said 
before that you wouldn’ t wait until inflation got to 2 percent to cut rates because of how inflation 
has lagged.  Does that apply for the labor market , too?  If the labor market is back in equilibrium, 
why is restrictive policy and , potentially, very restrictive policy, given the high real funds rate, 
warranted right now?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So this is the very reason that we ’re thinking about —that we ’ve said 
in our—in our statement that we ’re going back to looking at both mandates and that we think the 
risks are coming back into balance.  We think what the data broadly show in the labor market is 
an ongoing, gradual normalization of labor market conditions.  And that ’s what we want to see.  
You know, w e’ve seen that over a period of a couple of years and a move , really , from 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 7 of 25  
 overheated conditions to more normal conditions.  We are watching the labor market conditions 
quite closely , and that ’s what we ’re seeing.  If we —if we  start to see something that looks to be 
more than that, then we ’re well  positioned to respond.  That ’s, that’s  part of what we ’re thinking.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  And when you talk about seeing something that ’s more than 
whatever softness or slowdown you expect, in the past you’ ve said that stronger growth 
wouldn’ t, wouldn’t  override better news on inflation.  I wonder how that cuts the other way.  If 
you’re seeing more softness in the labor market than what you would expect, does that change 
the calculus on what you’ re looking for out of the inflation numbers to recalibrate policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So w e have , we have —growth isn ’t one of our three.  We have two 
mandates, as you know .  The labor market, maximum employment is one , and stable prices is 
another.  So we weigh —we weigh  those two things equally under the law.  When we were far 
away from our inflation mandate, we had to focus on that.  Now we ’re back , back to a closer to 
even focus, so we ’ll be looking at labor market conditions and asking whether we ’re getting what 
we’re seeing . 
And, as I said, we’ re prepared to respond if we see that it ’s—that it’s  not what we wanted 
to see, which was , you know, a gradual normalization of conditions —if we see more than that .  
And it wouldn’ t be any one statistic, although, of course , the unemployment rate is generally 
thought to be , you know, a single —a good single statistic .  But we ’d be looking at wages , we’d 
be looking at participation, w e’d be looking at all the things —surveys, quits, hires, all of those 
things —to determine the overall status of the labor market.   But we ’re looking at it now.  
I would say,  again, I think you’ re back to conditions that are close to 2019 conditions, 
and that was not an inflationary economy—broadly similar labor markets then .  I think inflation 
was actually —core inflation was actually running below 2 percent.  So we don’ t think —I don’ t 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 8 of 25  
 now think of the labor market in its current state as a likely source of significant inflationary 
pressures.  So I would—I would not like to see  a material further cooling in the labor market, and 
that’s part of what ’s behind our thinking.  The other part, of course, is that we have made real 
progress on inflation.  And  we’re —we’ve got growing confidence there that we are not quite 
there yet, but we ’re more confident that we’re on  a—that we ’re on a sustainable path down to 
2 percent.  So those two things ar e working together , and we ’re factoring those both into our 
policy.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Chris.  
CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  Chris Rugaber  at Associated Press.  You mentioned not 
wanting to see any further cooling in the job market .  Why not ?  Or would you consider 
preemptive cuts to prevent if you saw risks of an unexpected cooling?   Is that something you 
would cut ahead of time for?  
CHAIR POWELL.   So I wouldn’ t say I wouldn’ t want to see any other cooling.  I t would 
be more of  a material difference.  If we —if we ’d be looking at this and if we see something that 
looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would—we would have the intention of responding to.  So , in terms of—I don’ t think of it that way.  I think of it as , you 
know, we ’re actually in a good place here .  We’re balancing these two risks of , you know, go too 
soon, and you undermine progress on inf lation ; wait too long or don’ t go fast enough, and, and 
you put at risk the recovery.  And so we have to balance those two things .  That’s the nature of 
having two mandates , and I think we —this is how we balance them.  It’s a rough balance, but it 
does feel like, again, the labor market feels like it ’s in a place where it ’s just a process of 
ongoing normalization;  4.1 percent unemployment is still historically low .  And, you know, we ’ll 
just have to see what the data show us.  
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 9 of 25  
 CHRIS TOPHER RUGABER.  And , just to follow  up quickly:  [I] wanted to see what 
you thought of the recent JOLTS r eport, which did show hiring, gross hiring, has come down 
even below 2019 levels.  Layoffs remain low .  So it painted a picture of a very static labor 
market.  Is that sustainable in your view or something that is worrying?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think all of the data points continue to point to kind of the 
direction we would want to see .  So that was taken as, you know, there was a decline in job 
openings .  That was good.  T oday’ s ECI reading was a little softer than expected, so that ’s, that’s  
a good reading.  I t shows that wage increases are still at a strong level but that that level 
continues to come down to more sustainable levels over time.  That ’s exactly the pattern that we 
want to be seeing.  So I think the data —the dat a we’ve been seeing in the labor market are 
broadly consistent with that normalization process.  Again, we ’re closely monitoring to see 
whether it starts to show signs that it’ s more than that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, back in March, you talked 
about cutting rates as a process, and , in June , you talked about the idea that , well,  one rate cut 
wouldn’ t do anything.  So I wonder if you can sort of —follow ing up on Colby’ s question—talk 
about , are you weighing the economy right now in terms of its ability to withstand multiple rate 
cuts?  Talk us through the process that you think—or is it just one rate cut?  Or a re you in the 
process now of thinking that rates need to be nor malized here?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I can ’t really say that, honestly.  You know, we’re —we —
we’ve seen significant movement in the labor market , and, you know, we ’re very mindful of this 
question of, is it just normalization or is it more?  We think it ’s just normalization, but we want 
to be in a position to, to support the labor market.   At the same time , we’re seeing progress on 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 10 of 25  
 inflation.  So , you know, we actually got to this —we raised rates a year ago at the July meeting .  
And if you look at the situation in the economy a year ago, unemployment —sorry , inflation was 
over 4 percent .  It was a completely different economy.  Now we ’ve made a lot of progress , and 
the labor market—I think unemployment was in the 3s, mid -3s, so it ’s a different economy .  And 
I think it ’s time, it ’s coming to be time , to adjust that so that we support this continued process.  
The thing we ’re trying to do is —you know that we have, we ’ve had this really significant 
decline in inflation , and unemployment has remained low .  And this is a really unusual and 
historically, historically unusual and such a welcome outcome for the people we serve.  What 
we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going?  And this is —this is  part of that.  
We think we don’ t need to be 100 percent focused on inflation because of the progress we’ ve 
made :  12-month headline at 2½ [percent] , core at 2.6.  You know, it’ s way down from where it 
was.  The job is not done on inflation, but , nonetheless, we can afford to begin to dial back the 
restriction in our policy rate.  And I think we’re just —it’s part of a process.  
In terms of what that looks like, I mean , I think most rate —you would think, in a base 
case, that policy rates would move down from here, but I don’ t want to try to give specific 
forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think that’s really going to depend on the economy, and that ’s highly uncertain.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell.  Rachel Sieg el from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  On inflation, do the past few months of good reports look like what we saw last year, where you really had a lot of momentum, with a few bumps in between?   Would 
you characterize that kind of momentum as back on track at this point in the year?  
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 11 of 25  
 CHAIR POWELL.  Actually , what we ’re seeing now is a little better than what we saw 
last year.   Last year, as we pointed out late in the year, a whole lot of the progress we saw last 
year was from goods pr ices, which were going down at an unsustainable rate, disinflating at an 
unsustainable rate.  This is a broader disinflation .  This has goods prices coming down, but  it’s 
also—we ’re also now seeing progress in the other two big categories :  nonhousing services and 
housing services.  So , you know, the thing i s, we’ve only—you ’ve got one quarter of that .  We 
had seven months of low inflation ; you got one quarter of this.  I would say the quality of this is , 
is higher , and it ’s good, but so far , it’s only a quarter.  So I think, you know, we need to see more 
to know that we ’re—to have more confidence that we ’re on, on  a good path down to 2 percent.  
But as I mentioned, our confidence is growing because we ’ve been getting good data.  And 
things like the ECI r eport and, frankly , the softening in the labor market conditions , you know, 
give you more confidence that the economy’ s not overheating .  It doesn ’t look like an 
overheating economy, and it looks like an economy that ’s normalizing.  
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And if we ’re to think about the first couple months of the year, is 
there any sense now that they were these blips that could have actually allowed for earlier rate 
cuts as were some of the projections going into 2024?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So the thing about —if what it is is seasonality , and it could just be —
it’s very, very hard to, you know, to  do appropriate seasonal adjustments .  If that’ s what it is, 
then that actually implies that, that  other months were under reporting too low inflation.  I f you 
smoothed it out, it ’s a zero -sum game.  And that ’s why we look at 12 months .  We look at 
12 months because that takes all  of that out, all those effects out.  Twelve -month now is 
2½ percent headline, 2.6 percent core.  This is so m uch better than where we were even a year 
ago.  It’ s a lot better.  Now, t he job is not done .  I want to stress that, and we ’re committed to 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 12 of 25  
 getting the job—inflation sustainably under 2 percent, but we need to take note of that progress, 
and we need to weigh the risks to the labor market and the risks to our inflation target now more 
equally than we did a year ago.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  I ’d like to 
ask you about the balance of risks as the American people see it.  At this point, is the risk greater to leave interest rates where they are, given the damage that higher interest rates do to the economy in slowing demand and raising prices?  Or is it more important for the American people that you keep rates where they are to bring inflation down?  
CHAIR POWELL.   I, I—you know, I  think that we ’ve been given an assignment by 
Congress .  This is how we serve the American people is by achieving maximum employment 
and price stability, right?  And so in our , you know, quasi -constitutional document, the Statement 
on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look at the two goals , and if one of 
them is farther away than the other—the two variables , inflation and employment— if one is 
farther away from its goal than the other, then you , you concentrate on the one that ’s farther 
away.  And you take account  of the time to reach the goal.  
So, for the last couple of years , the best service we could do to the American people was 
to focus on inflation.  But as inflation has come down —and I think the upside risks to inflation 
have decreased as the labor market has cooled off, and now  the labor market has softened —you 
know, probably the inflation, inflation ’s probably a little farther from its target than is 
employment, but I think the downside risks to, to  the employment mandate are , are real now.  So 
we have to weigh all that , and if you think about  where that takes us is we have a restrictive 
policy rate .  It’s clearly restrictive.  I t’s been the rate we’ ve had in place for a full year .  And the 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 13 of 25  
 time is coming —as other central banks around the world are facing the same question —the time 
is coming at which it will begin to be appropriate to dial back that level of restrictions , restriction 
so that we may address both mandates.  
MICHAEL MCKEE.  Well , you have event risk basically, with the jobs report on Friday 
and another one before you meet again.  Are you certain that you won’ t fall behind the curve and 
lead to unnecessary unemployment if you wait until September?  
CHAIR POWELL.  “ Certainty ” is not a word that we have in our —in our  business.  So, 
you know, we get —we get  a lot of data between now and September, and it isn ’t going to be one 
data read or even two .  It’s going to be the totality of the data, all of the data, and not just —and 
then how is that affecting the outlook?   And how is it affecting the balance of risks?  That ’s 
going to be the assessment that we do.  Of course , we’ll, we ’ll all look carefully at the 
employment report, but so much other data coming in and so much happening between now and 
the September meeting, and we ’ll, you know, we’ll make a judgment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Edward Lawrence of F ox 
Business.  I do want to dig deeper on what Michael and, and what Nick were asking.  There ’s a, 
a shift in the statement to balance between the focus between inflation and jobs.  Looking at the 
job sides, we ’ve seen wage data show sort of an abrupt slowing.  We’ve —we’re hearing on 
earnings calls from companies like Intel abrupt layoffs.  In the jobs r eport from the BLS, 
government jobs has been a leading creator.  Could the government jobs —as a sector —hiring 
mask underlying weakness in the jobs r eport?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , you know, we ’ll look at everything.  We’ ve seen some , some  
tendency to have a narrowing base of job creation in some months going back, but then we ’ve 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 14 of 25  
 had some months where , where  job creation was broader.  And also , you know, the headline 
number of jobs has come down, so—but you look at the whole thing.  A nd I think you do look at 
private demand extra carefully, to your point about , about  government.  So we ’ll just be looking 
at, at all those things.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.   Just as a follow then —so could the F ed then be behind the 
curve ?  Because you said some of the reports—in the last meeting , you said the reports could be 
noisy or overstated.  Was there a discussion of , of—what kind of discussion was there for a cut 
today, and could the F ed be “ behind the curve ”? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so look, the objective is to balance the two risks, right?  It ’s 
the risk of going too soon and the risk of going too late.  We’ve been —you know, we , we had 
seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year .  We said we wanted to see more.  W e 
said—we pointed out that too much of this was coming from goods, and, sure enough, the first 
quarter wasn ’t, wasn’t  great —inflatio n data .  And now we ’ve got another quarter —a quarter that 
is good.  A nd, you know, we ’re balancing the risk  of going too soon against the risk of going too 
late.  That ’s what we ’re doing.  There ’s no guarantee in this .  It’s a very difficult judgment call, 
but this is —this is  how we ’re making it.  
So—but in terms of today, your question about today, we did have a —you know, we had 
a nice conversation about , about  this issue today.  The overall sense of the C ommittee, as I 
mentioned, is that we ’re getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to begin to dial 
back restriction, but we ’re not quite at that point yet.  We want to see more good data.  The 
decision was unanimous —all 19 participants supported it.  B ut there was a real discussion back 
and forth of what the case would be for , for moving at this meeting.  A strong majority supported 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 15 of 25  
 moving—not moving at this meeting.  That was the strong sense of the C ommittee .  But it’ s a 
conversation that we had today, certainly.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Courtenay.  
COURTENAY BROWN.  Courtenay Brown from Axios.  Thank you for taking our 
questions.  When the F ed was raising rates, there was a lot of conversation about long and 
variable lags.  I wonder if that applies on the way down, too.  How are you and the C ommittee 
thinking about that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yes, it does.  And I think the lags have kind of showed up here in the 
last six months, by the way.  You , you really do now see the restriction, whereas, I mean , even a 
few months ago, people were questioning how restrictive policy was.  Look at the labor market 
now—you can see.  A nd look at inflation—sorry —rate -sensitive, interest -sensitive spending.  
You really do see now that policy is restrictive.  I wouldn’ t say it’ s extremely restrict ive, but it ’s 
certainly effectively restrict ive.  Yes , there —the lag should, should be on the way down.  I t 
should take some time to get into —to get into  the full economy, a ffect financial conditions .  And 
that affects economic activity, hiring and that kind of thing , and, ultimately , inflation.  It 
doesn’t —it’s not instantaneous , although it ’s faster than it used to be because markets move now 
in anticipation of our moves. 
COURTENAY BROWN.  So are you worried then that if monetary policy acts with long 
and variable lags, even when you’ re lowering interest rates, it might be too late for the F ed to 
help stave off any kind of slowdown in the labor market or broader economy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We have to worry about that.  I mean,  we—just to make it clear, you 
know, it’ s a very difficult , challenging judgment, and we don’t  want to go too soon, and we don’ t 
want to go too late.  But that ’s—this is how we made that judgment.  I feel good about where we 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 16 of 25  
 are.  We ’re certainly very well  positioned to respond to weakness with the policy rate at 
5.3 percent.  We certainly have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness.  That’s not 
what we ’re seeing , though.  W hat we ’re seeing —look at the —look at the  first- half growth 
numbers .  Look at PDFP at 2.6 percent for the first half.  I t’s not signaling a weak economy.  It ’s 
also not signaling an overheating economy. 
Labor market—admittedly, the unemployment rate ha s moved up seven -tenths, and we ’re 
seeing —we’re seeing  normalization there, but wage , wage  increases are still at a high level .  
Unemployment is still at a low level.  Layoffs are very low .  Initial claims have moved up, but 
they’ re pretty stable , and they’ re historically not high at all.  So the total scope of the data 
suggest s a normalizing labor market,  and, again, we are carefully watching to see that that 
continues to be the case.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  On the labor market, I was 
wondering, how worried are you all about unemployment rising to the point where it triggers the 
Sahm r ule, and would that potentially affect how quickly you cut rates?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We—so I would just say, the question really is , is one of , are we 
worried about a sharper downturn in the labor market?  So, and the answer is, we ’re watching 
really carefully for that.  We’re, we’re  aware of that rule, which is really a,  you know, a —I 
would call it a statistical, statistical  thing that has happened through history.  A “ statistical 
regularity ” is what I ’d call it.  It’s not like an economic rule where it ’s telling you something 
must happen. 
So, again, what do we see?  What are our eyes telling us?  We look at —we look at  all the 
things we ’re seeing, and what it looks like is a normalizing labor market —again, job creation at a 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 17 of 25  
 pretty decent level, wages moving up at a strong level but coming down gradually.  J ob 
vacancies have come down, but they ’re still high by historical standards.  So, again, I ’ve been 
through some of the data already, but what we think we ’re seeing is, is  a normalizing labor 
market, and we ’re watching carefully to see if it —if it turns out to be more .  If it starts to show 
signs that it ’s more than that, then we ’re well positioned to respond. 
VICTORIA GUIDA.   Is there reason to think that the labor market might behave 
differently this time than it has historically?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think, you know, history doesn’ t repeat itself;  it rhymes.   That 
statement is very true about the economy .  You never assume it ’s going to be just the same.  An 
example would be, is there a trend increase in the level of vacancies?  There are many, many 
examples, so it ’s never exactly the same.  Also, let ’s remember that this p andemic era has been 
one in which so many, you know, apparent rules have been flouted , like the inverted yield curve 
for starters.  So, many, many received —pieces of received wisdom just haven ’t worked, and it ’s 
because this situation really is unusual or unique in that so much of this inflation came from the 
shutdown of the economy and the resulting supply problems in the face of, admittedly, very strong demand.  So the whole —the whole  situation is not the same as many of the other prior 
inflation or downturns that we ’ve seen or business cycles that we ’ve seen.  So we ’re having to 
learn .  We’re having to, to be very careful about the judgments that we make, I would say.  So 
we don’ t assume that these regularities will, will  just repeat themsel ves automatically.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Amara.  
AMARA OMEOKWE.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  Amara Omeokwe with Bloomberg.  
There seems to be quite a difference between what the anecdotal data are telling us, such as the very recent downbeat Beige Book, and the hard data.  Do you take those anecdotes seriously—
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 18 of 25  
 that is , that the economy and labor market are cooling much more rapidly than what ’s shown in 
the data ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I do take that seriously, and the Beige Book is great.  What ’s even 
greater is hearing the R eserve B ank presidents come in and talk about their conversations with , 
with businesses and business leaders and workers and people in the nonprofit sector in their 
Districts.  But I ’ll tell you, it’ s a pretty —the picture is , is not one of a slowing or , you know, a 
really bad economy.  I t’s one of there are spots of weakness, and there are regions where growth 
is stronger than other regions, but , overall, it ’s—again, look at the aggregate data.  The a ggregate 
data is—particula rly PDFP, private domestic f inal purchases —is 2.6 percent , and that ’s a good 
indicator of private —of private  demand.  So we listen to all of that, and it does, does —I think 
it’s important to listen to anecdotal data and not just look at the aggregate data.  Especially , you 
know, it’ s very hard —GDP data can be volatile quarter to quarter.  So it ’s just hard to measure 
economic activity.  T here are a lot of —it’ s just difficult to do.  So I look at both, but I wouldn’ t 
say that the —that the  anecdotal data is uniformly downbeat .  It’s more mixed.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jo Ling. 
JO LING KENT.  Thank you.  Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.  Chair Powell, thanks for 
taking our questions today.  You have consistently said that the F ed does not consider politics in 
making decisions.  With a possible September rate cut on the table, it would be less than two months before the election, and former President Trump reportedly said that cutting rates so close to the election is something the central bank knows “ they shouldn’ t be doing.”   What ’s 
your response , and do you believe it ’s possible to r eally remain apolitical with a  September rate 
cut? 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 19 of 25  
 CHAIR POWELL.  I absolutely do, and I think it ’s—first of all, we haven ’t made any 
decisions.  I would say it this way:   haven ’t made any decision about any future meeting.  I don’ t 
know what the data will reveal or how that will affect the appropriate path of our policy .  I really 
don’t know.  I do know how we will make that assessment.  That ’s what I do know. 
So if you take a step back, the current situation , again , is inflation has come down much 
closer to our goal, and that ’s happened while unemployment has remained low.  We’ re, we’re  
very tightly focused on using our tools to try to foster that state of affairs continuing.  That’s at 
each of our meetings and all of our decisions, our focus is strictly on that and really on nothing 
else—doing our part, whatever that part may be.  You know, w e’re using our best thinking.  
We’re doing our best to understand the economy.   We, we follow academics.  W e follow the 
many commentators who bless us with their commentary  [laughter], but we don’ t change 
anything in our approach to address other factors, like the political calendar.  
Congress has, we believe, ordered us to conduct our business in a nonpolitical way at all 
times, not just some of the time.  I ’ll say this , too:  We never use our tools to support or oppose a 
political party, a politician, or any political outcome.  The bottom line is, if we do our very best to do our part and we stick to our part, that will benefit all Americans.  If we get it right, the 
economy will be stronger .  We’ll have price stability .  People will find jobs .  Wages will rise in 
real terms .  Everyone  will benefit.  So that ’s what we believe, and that ’s how we will always act.  
This is my fourth presidential election at the F ed.  I can tell you this is how we think about it.  
This is what we do.  So anything that we do before, during, or after the election will be based on the data, the outlook, and the balance of risks and not on anything else.  
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 20 of 25  
 JO LING KENT.  Just a quick follow -up—do your economic forecasts and models take 
into account the two very different economic plans of these two presidential candidates, Harris 
and Trump, and, if so, how?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No.  We do not do that.  We absolutely do not do that.  We don’ t—
we don’t  know who’ s going to win.  We don’ t know what they’ re going to do.  W e don’ t act as 
though we know , and we just can ’t do that , you know ?  We basically —we have our forecast .  
We’re not —we can run simulations of different potential policies, but we would never try to 
make policy decisions based on the outcome of an election that hasn’ t happened yet.  We would 
just—that would just be a line we would never cross.  You know, w e’re a nonpolitical agency.  
We don’ t want to be involved in any —in politics in any way, so we wouldn’ t do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nicholas.  
NICHOLAS JASINSKI.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Nicholas Jasinski from Barron’ s 
Magazine.  There hasn ’t been a dissenting vote on an interest rate decision in some time.   If the 
data do evolve as you expect, if you do have more confidence by the September meeting, do you get the sense that there will be a unanimous vote on an interest rate move in September? Basically, are there meaningful differences in C ommittee members ’ assessments of how much 
more confidence is needed? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So there’s —there are always meaningful differences.   There are.   
And, you know, we talk a lot before, during, and after the meeting.  We do have a very robust 
discussion of these things.  You ’re right that in , in most cases , people, if they feel heard and they 
feel that they ’ve—that their position has been given serious consideration, for most people , most 
of the time , that ’s going to be enough.  There are dissents.  T hat’s fine.  You know, no one has a 
veto.  N o single person has a veto, so it just is a question of, who will vote for and against ?  
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 21 of 25  
 We’ve had —we’ve had, you know, dissents.  We haven ’t had so many during the pandemic era, 
and it just may be that we , we felt more united because we felt under a lot of pressure to get 
things right, but before the pandemic , we had plenty of dissents.  And dissents happen.  It’s part 
of the process .  There’s nothing wrong with dissents , and if it happens , it happens.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jean.  
JEAN YUNG.  Hello .  Jean Yung with MNI Market News.  Is a 50  basis point cut as a 
first cut at all likely or even on the table?  Thank you.  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I don’ t want to say —I don’ t want to be really specific 
about what we ’re going to do, but that ’s, that’s  not something we ’re thinking about right now. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Of course , we haven ’t made any decisions at all as of today.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.   Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  Not to get into the minutes , but you said there was a real discussion today for 
moving at this meeting.  I’m curious if you could provide some more color on the nature of the 
discussion today at the meeting about a possible rate cut as early as September.  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so , you know, the way the meeting is set up , the first day 
there ’s a discussion of financial stability because it ’s every other meeting we have that , and then 
we have an opportunity to comment on that.  Then we have an economic go- round.  And then, 
this morning , we have the monetary policy go -round.  And I think in people ’s economic or in 
their monetary policy go -round, people express their views about this, and , you know, there ’s a 
range of views.  People —as you will know from the spee ches that they give —people have 
different ways of thinking about the economy.  And so, in the minutes , we’ll lay this out in a 
much—in a much better way than I can do off the cuff, but there ’s a range of perspectives.  A nd, 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 22 of 25  
 you know —but I do think that we are, we ’re a consensus- driven organization.  People come 
together .  This was a unanimous —a unanimous  decision.  A nd, at the end, everyone , everyone  
supported the outcome —not just the voters, but everyone.  So I would also say, some people 
examined the possibility,  you know, the case for moving at this meeting, but , overwhelmingly, 
the sense of the Committee  was not at this meeting but as soon as the next meeting, depending 
on how the data come in. 
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  But there is a growing sense of confidence that you could 
move at the next meeting — 
 CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  —assuming inflation comes ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Well , assuming that the totality of the data supports such an 
outcome.  No question.  That’s, that is the case, as I mentioned .  We think that the time is,  is—
it’s approaching, and if we do get the data that we —that we  hope we get, then a reduction in our 
policy rate could be on the table at the September meeting.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Nancy.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with 
Marketplace.  Former New York president Bill Dudley wrote an op- ed in Bloomberg earlier this 
month, which you probably saw, in which he said, “ It might already be too late to fend off a 
recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk. ”  Is he wrong?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So this is the judgment that we have to make , and we ’re, we’re  well 
aware of the judgment.  We’re—as I ’ve said, we have to weigh the risk of going too soon against 
the risk of going too late.  If we go too soon, we can —we had a lot of advice , you know, to go 
ahead and cut after the seven good months of last year.  We didn’ t.  We said we needed to see 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 23 of 25  
 more.  Then we saw some higher inflation.  We ’ve seen one quarter of good inflation, and we ’ve 
seen the labor market move quite a bit .  And, as I mentioned, I don’ t think it needs to cool off 
anymore for us to get the inflation results that are related to the labor market—not all inflation is , 
of course.  So I think it ’s a difficult judgment to make , and what you see is the judgment of the 
Committee is that that time is drawing near.  T hat time could be in September if , if the data 
support that.  
NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And have the chances of  a hard landing increased?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So I, I don’ t know whether they’ ve increased .  I think they ’re low.  I 
think this is —you don’ t see any reason to think that this economy is either overheating or sharply 
weakening.  That’s just not in the data right now.  What ’s in the data right now is an economy 
that’s growing at a —at a solid pace, a labor market that has cooled off, but , nonetheless, 
inflation —sorry , unemployment is low .  The data overall show a strong labor market.  And so 
that’s, that’s  really what you see.  
It’s not —it’s neither an overheating economy, nor is it a sharply weakening economy.  
It’s, it’s kind of what you would want to see, but , of course , the job is never done.  You know, 
we’re, we’re  watching to see, you know, which way the economy heads .  And I think we ’re—if 
we are to respond to weakness, we ’re certainly , you know, well  equipped to do that .  But that ’s 
not what we ’re seeing.  What we’ re seeing is strong economic activity and, you know, a good 
labor market and inflation coming down. 
MICHE LLE SMITH.  Greg.  
GREG ROBB.  Thank you so much.  In the —in the  minutes of the June meeting that 
came out a few weeks ago, there was a discussion about communications, and some F ed officials 
said maybe the F ed wasn ’t as clear enough about its reaction function.  And , and when I talked to 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 24 of 25  
 the commentators who bless you with their comments  [laughter], they say that they really don’ t 
have a sense of what is going to judge, maybe not the first cut, but the pace of the cuts going 
forward .  They don’ t have a good sense of that.  Is there anything you can say, like how will we 
judge that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, I mean , I think the reality is that, that  forecasters—and this 
isn’t just the Fed by any means —forecasters have been continually surprised by, for example, the 
strength of the economy last year.   So I think we had to be pretty humble about , about  giving 
forward guidance about this, that, and the other thing.  We need to be pretty careful about that .  
And, you know, when you’ re saying you’ re going to be data driven, of course , it’s always what 
the data —how they affect the outlook and the  balance of risks, but it ’s—nobody has great vision 
deep into the future.  
In terms of a reaction function, that ’s a—that’s a long- time discussion that people have 
had forever.  I think people have understood for a long time , actually , that we were very focused 
on bringing down inflation.  N obody was really confused about that.  The data have, you know —
again, we ’ve seen significant improvement in inflation just for the last quarter.  Markets move 
around on that —on the data , really .  Not so much —it’ s not really what we ’re going to do.  I t’s 
more just that the data keep coming in , and markets are very , very responsive to that data right 
now. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Go to Jeff for the last question.  
JEFF COX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I ’m going to change gears on you just a little bit 
from all of the rate talk and whatnot.   With FedNow being in the books for a little over a year, 
there hasn ’t been a whole lot of talk about central bank digital currency and wondering if you 
could give us an update on where things are with that.  Is that considered a  dead  issue now ?  Is it 
July 31, 202 4   Chair Powell’s Press Conference   FINAL  
Page 25 of 25  
 still something that ’s being discussed within the Committee , and what, what ’s happening with 
that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  It’ s not something that comes up at all with the —in the FOMC .  So, 
more broadly, digital finance is an area that ’s having—that  has really significant implications for 
payments generally, instant payments.  And , you know, it’ s something that’ s going to really 
change the way —it’ s going to make more efficient and , hopefully, safer and all those things —
the way payments are made around the world.  And so we have people who are researching that 
and trying to keep up to speed, because we play an important role in the payments sector, both as a convener and as an operator , too. 
In terms of a CBDC, there ’s really nothing new going on.  T here’s not much going on at 
all.  We’re not —we don’ t have the authority to issue a  CB—a  retail CBDC that ’s available to the 
public.  We ’re not seeking that authority.  So what we ’re doing is keeping up with—keeping up 
with developments there .  Pretty much every major central bank in the world is at least doing , 
doing that.  Some of them are actually seriously looking at implementing a CBDC .  We’re really 
not.  We’ re really just evaluating , you know, the story and what ’s happening out there.  So I 
think it ’s work that we need to be doing, which could be very beneficial down the road, but we 
don’t have —on a CBDC, we don’ t have any plan to.  We would need to go to Congress , and we 
have no plan to do that .  We’re not —no one here has decided that we think it ’s a good idea yet.  
Thank you.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Thank you.

 Transcript of Chair Powell’ s Press Conference  
September 18, 2024 
 
CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon.  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on 
achieving our dual -mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of 
the American people.  Our economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward 
our goals over the past two years.   The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated 
state.   Inflation has eased substantially from a peak of 7 percent to an estimated 2.2 percent as of 
August.  We’re committed to maintaining our economy ’s strength by supporting maximum 
employment and returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.  
Today , the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy 
restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by ½  percentage point.  This decision reflects our 
growing confidence that with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the 
labor market can be maintained in a context of moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2 percent.  We also decided to continue to reduce our securities holdings.  I 
will have more to say about monetary policy after briefly revi ewing economic developments.  
Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid 
pace.   GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of the year, and available data 
point to a roughly similar pace of growth this quarter.   Growth of consumer spending has 
remained resilient, and investment in equipment and intangibles has picked up from its anemic 
pace last year.   In the housing sector, investment fell back in the second quarter after rising 
strongly in the first.   Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the 
strong performance of the U.S. economy over the past year.  In our Summary of Economic Projections, Committee participants generally expect GDP growth to remain solid, with a median 
projection of 2 percent over the next few years.  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 2 of 26  
 In the labor market, conditions have continued to cool.  Payroll job gains averaged 
116,000 per month over the past three months, a notable step -down from the pace seen earlier in 
the year.  The unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent.  Nominal wage 
growth has eased over the past year , and the jobs -to-workers gap has narrowed.  Overall, a broad 
set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are now less tight than just before 
the pandemic in 2019.  The labor market is n ot a source of elevated inflationary pressures.   The 
median projection for the unemployment rate in the SEP is 4. 4 percent at the end of this year, 
four-tenths higher than projected in June. 
Inflation has eased notably over the past two years but remains above our longer -run goal 
of 2 percent.   Estimates based on the c onsumer p rice index and other data indicate that total PCE 
prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent.  Longer -term inflation expectations 
appear to remain well  anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, 
businesses, and forecasters as well as measur es from financial markets.   The median projection 
in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 2.3 percent this year and 2.1 percent next year, somewhat lower than projected in June. Thereafter, the median projection is 2 percent.  
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people.   For much of the past three years, 
inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight.   Our primary focus had been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so.  We are 
acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship , as it erodes purchasing power, 
especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 3 of 26  
 Our restrictive monetary policy has helped restore the  balance between aggregate supply 
and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remain well 
anchored.  Our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends:   Inflation is now much 
closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.  
As inflation has declined and the labor market has cooled, the upside risks to inflation 
have diminished, and the downside risks to employment have increased.  We now see the risks to 
achieving our employment and inflation goals as roughly in balance, and we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.  
In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, at today ’s meeting , the 
Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point to 4¾ percent to 5 percent.  This recalibration of our policy stance will help maintain the strength of 
the economy and the labor market and will continue to enable further progress on inflation as we 
begin the process of moving toward a more neutral stance.   We are not on any preset course.  We 
will continue to make our decision s meeting by meeting.  
We know that reducing policy restraint too quickly could hinder progress on inflation.  At 
the same time, reducing restraint too slowly could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.  In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the  federal funds rate, 
the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  
In our SEP, FOMC participants wrote down their individual assessments of an 
appropriate path for the federal funds rate, based on what each participant judges to be the most likely scenario going forward.  If the economy evolves as expected, the median participant 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 4 of 26  
 projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.4 percent at the end of this 
year and 3.4 percent at the end of 2025.  These median projections are lower than in June, 
consistent with the projections for lower inflation and higher unemployment, as well as the changed balance of risks.  These projections, however, are not a Committee plan or decision.  
As the economy evolves, monetary policy will adjust in order to best promote our 
maximum -employment and price -stability goals.  If the economy remains solid and inflation 
persists, we can dial back policy restraint more slowly.   If the labor market were to weaken 
unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we are prepared to respond.  Policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandat e. 
The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy— maximum employment and 
stable prices.   We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation 
back down to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer -term inflation expectations well anchored.  
Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans.   We understand that our 
actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country.   Everything we do is in 
service to our public mission.  We at the Fed will do everyt hing we can to achieve our maximum -
employment and price -stability goals. 
Thank you.  I look forward to your questions.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Steve.  
STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve Liesman, CNBC.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman , for taking our 
questions.  In July , you said you weren’ t necessarily thinking about a 50.  Y ou didn’ t want to be 
specific, but you said you weren’ t thinking about a 50.  The inflation data last week came out a 
little firmer than expected .  Retail was strong, third -quarter GDP running 3 percent .  So what 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 5 of 26  
 changed that made the Committee go 50, and how do you respond to the concerns that perhaps it 
shows the F ed is more concerned about the labor market?  And I guess, should we expect more 
50s in the months ahead?  And based on what should we make that call?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  So, okay, a lot of questions in there.  [Laughter]  Let me jump in.  So, 
since the last meeting —okay, the last meeting we have had a lot of data come in.  We’ve had the 
two employment reports, July and August .  We’ve also had two inflation reports, including one 
that came in during blackout .  We had the QCEW report, which suggests that maybe —that not 
maybe, but suggests that the payroll report numbers that we ’re getting may be artificially high 
and will be revised down .  You know that.  We’ve also seen anecdotal data, like [the data 
collected in] the Beige Book.  S o we took all of those , and we went into blackout .  And we 
thought about what to do, and we concluded that this was the right thing for the economy, for the people that we serve, and that ’s, that’s  how we made our decision.  So that ’s one question.  What 
was the second and third? 
STEVE LIESMAN.  How do we make the —sorry, thank you, sir.  How do we figure out 
in the months ahead, is there another 25 or 50 coming in based on what should we make that call?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So a couple things .  A good place to start is the —is the  SEP, 
but let me start with what I said, which was that we ’re going to be making decisions meeting by 
meeting based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks.  If you look at 
the SEP, you’ ll, you’ll  see that it ’s, it’s a process of recalibrating our policy stance away from 
where we had it a year ago, when inflation was high and unemployment low, to a place that ’s 
more appropriate given where we are now and w here we expect to be.  And that process will take 
place over time.  There ’s nothing in the —in the  SEP that suggests the Committee is in a rush to 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 6 of 26  
 get this done.  This, this  process evolves over time.   Of course , that ’s a projection .  That’s a 
baseline projection.  We know, as I mentioned in my remarks, that the actual things that we do 
will depend on the way the economy evolves.  We can go quicker if that ’s appropriate .  We can 
go slower if that ’s appropriate.  We can pause if that ’s appropriate.  But that’ s, that’s  what we are 
contemplating.  A gain, I would point you to the SEP as just an assessment of where —what the 
Committee is thinking today —what the individual members , rather, of the Committee are 
thinking today , assuming that their particular forecasts take —you know, are realized.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Let ’s go to Chris.  
CHRIS RUGABER.  Hi .  Chris Rugaber at Associated Press.  Thank you.  The 
projections show that the F ed—Fed  officials expect the fed funds rate to still be above their 
estimate of long -run neutral by the end of next year.  So does that suggest that you see  rates as 
restrictive for that entire period?  Does that threaten the weakening of the job market that you 
said you’ d like to avoid?  Or does it suggest that maybe people see the short -run neutral as a little 
bit higher ?  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.  I think it would —the way I would really characterize it i s this :  I 
think people write down their estimate, individuals do.  I think every single person on the 
Committee, if you asked them , what ’s your level of certainty around that, they would say there ’s 
a wide range where that could fall.   So I think we don’ t know .  There are model -based 
approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time.  But, realistically, we know it by its works.  So that leaves us in a place where we’ ll 
be—where we expect , in the base case, to be continuing to remove restriction, and we ’ll be 
looking at the way the economy reacts to that .  And that ’ll be guiding us in our thinking about the 
question that we ’re asking at every meeting, which is , is our policy stance the appropriate one?  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 7 of 26  
 We know —if you go back, we know that the policy stance we adopted in July of 2023 came at a 
time when unemployment was 3½ percent and inflation was 4.2 percent.  Today , unemployment 
is up to 4.2 percent ; inflation ’s down to a few tenths above 2.  So we know that it is time to 
recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and 
on employment moving to a more sustainable level .  So the balance of risks are now even.  And 
this is the beginning of that process I ment ioned, the direction of which is toward a sense of 
neutral, and we ’ll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real  time.  What you have 
is our individual —accumulation of individual estimates of what that will be in the base case.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Howard Schneider with Reuters.  How close was this in terms 
of the decision?  You do have the first dissent by a G overnor  since 2005, I think .  Was the weight 
clearly in favor of a 50, or was this a very close decision?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I think we had a good—a good discussion .  You know, i f you go 
back, I talked about this at Jackson Hole, but I didn’ t address the question of the size of the cut 
and left it open, and I think we left it open going into blackout .  And so there was a lot of 
discussion back and forth, good diversity of —excellent discussion today.   I think there was also 
broad support for the decision that the Committee voted on.  So I would add, though, look at the 
SEP.  All 19 of the participants wrote down mul tiple cuts this year.  All 19.  That’s a big change 
from June, right?  Seven of the —seven of them wrote down three or more and—sorry, 17 of the 
19 wrote down three or more cuts , and 10 of the 19 wrote down four or more cuts.  So, you 
know, there is a dissent , and there ’s a range of views , but there ’s actually a lot of common 
ground as well.  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 8 of 26  
 HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Follow -up to that .  Now that this is in the books, can you give 
us some guidance as sort of  a follow -up to Steve on the pacing here?  Would you expect this to 
be running every other meeting once we get into next year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’re going to take it meeting by meeting, as I mentioned.  T here’s 
no sense that the Committee feels it ’s in a rush to do this.  We made a good, strong start to this , 
and that ’s really, frankly, a sign of our confidence —confidence that inflation is , is coming down 
toward 2 percent on a sustainable basis.  That gives us the ability.  We can , you know, make a 
good, strong start.  But —and I ’m very pleased that we did.  To me , the logic of this, both from an 
economic standpoint and also from a risk -management standpoint, was clear.   But I think we ’re 
going to go carefully , meeting by meeting, and make our decisions as we go. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jeanna.  
JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Jeanna Smialek, New York Times.   Thanks for 
taking our questions.  You and your colleagues in your economic projections today see the 
unemployment rate climbing to 4.4 percent and staying there.  Obviously, historically , when the 
unemployment rate climbs that much over a relatively short period of time, it doesn’ t typically 
just stop —it continues increasing.  And so I wonder if you can walk us through why you see the 
labor market stabilizing, sort of what’ s the mechanism there?  And what do you see as the risks?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, again, the labor market is actually in solid condition, a nd our 
intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.  You can say that about the whole 
economy.  The U.S. economy is in good shape.  It ’s growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming 
down, the labor market is in a strong pace, we want to keep it there.  That’s, that’s  what we ’re 
doing. 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 9 of 26  
 MICHELLE  SMITH .  Sorry —Nick.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  Nick Timiraos  of the Wall Street Journal.  Chair Powell, does today’ s 
action constitute a catch -up in action given recent substantial revisions to the employment data, 
or is this larger -than-typical rate cut a function of the elevated nominal level of the policy rate 
such that an accelerated cadence could be expected to continue? 
CHAIR POWELL.  Okay, multiple questions in there .  So I would say we don’ t think 
we’re behind .  We do not think—we think this is timely, but I think you can take this as a sign of 
our commitment not to get behind.  So it’s, it’s a strong move.  Sorry, your other question was?  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  It was, is this about what happened in the employment data between 
this meeting and the last meeting?  Or is this about the level of the funds rate —the high nominal 
level of funds rate relative to what might be expected if you ’re trying to maintain equilibrium?   
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think it ’s about —we come into this with a policy position that 
was put in place, as you know, I mentioned, in July of 2023, which was a time of high inflation 
and very low unemployment.  We’ve been very patient about , about  reducing the policy rate.  
We’ve waited .  Other central banks around the world have cut, many of them several times.  
We’ve waited , and I think that that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our 
confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2 perc ent.  So I think that is what enables 
us to take this , this  strong move today.  I do not think that anyone should look at this and say , 
“Oh, this is the new pace.”   You know, you have to think about it in terms of the base case .  Of 
course , what happens will happen.  S o, so, in the base case, what you see is —look at the SEP, 
you see cuts moving along.  T he sense of this is we’ re recalibrating policy down over time to a 
more neutral level.  And we ’re moving at the pace that we think is appropriate given 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 10 of 26  
 developments in the economy and the base case.  The economy can develop in a way that would 
cause us to go faster or slower, but that ’s what the base case is.  
NICK TIMIRAOS.  And, if I could follow  up on the  balance sheet , in 2019, when you 
did the mid -cycle adjustment, you ceased the balance sheet runoff.  With a larger cut today, is 
there any —should there be any signal inferred about how the Committee would approach “ end 
state”  on the balance sheet policy?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, in the current situation, reserves have really been stable.  T hey 
haven’ t come down.  So reserves are still abundant and expected to remain so for some time.   As 
you know, the shrinkage in our balance sheet has really come out of the overnight R RP [facility].  
So I think what that tells you is , we’re not thinking about , about  stopping runoff because of this 
at all.   We know that these two things can happen side by side .  In a sense, they’ re both a form of 
normalization , and so, for a time , you can have the balance  sheet shrinking but also be cutting 
rates.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Colby. 
COLBY SMITH.  Thank you.  Colby Smith with the Financial Times.   Just following up 
on Jeanna ’s question on rising unemployment .  Is it your view that this is just a function of a 
normalizing labor market amid improved supply, or is there anything to suggest that something more concerning perhaps is taking place here, given that other metrics of labor demand have softened too?  And I guess, in direct follow -up to Jeanna, do you not —why should we not expect 
a further deterioration in labor market conditions if policy is still restrict ive? 
CHAIR POWELL.  So I think what we ’re seeing is, clearly labor market conditions have 
cooled off by any measure, as I talked about in Jackson Hole, and—but they’ re still at a level—
the level of those conditions is actually pretty close to what I would call maximum employment.  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 11  of 26  
 So you’ re close to mandate, maybe at mandate, on that.   So what ’s driving it?  Clearly, clearly 
payroll job creation has moved down over the last few months, and this bears watching.  Many —
By many other measures, the labor market has returned to or below 2019 levels, which was a 
very good, strong labor market, but this is more sort of 2018, ’17.  So the labor market bears 
close—bears close watching , and we ’ll be giving it that.  But ultimately, we think —we believe, 
with an appropriate recalibration of our policy , that we can continue to see the economy growing, 
and that will support the labor market.  In the meantime, if you look at the growth in economic 
activity data , retail sales data that we just got, second -quarter GDP —all of this indicates an 
economy that is still growing at a solid pace.  So that should also support the labor market over 
time.   So—but again, we ’re—it bears watching .  And we ’re watching.  
COLBY SMITH.  And just on the point about starting to see rising layoffs, if that were to 
happen, wouldn’ t the Committee already be too late in terms of avoiding a recession?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we ’re—that ’s—you know, our plan, of course , has been to begin 
to recalibrate and  we’re —as you know, we ’re not seeing rising claims, we ’re not seeing rising 
layoffs, we ’re not seeing that , and we ’re not hearing that from companies that that ’s something 
that’s getting ready to happen.  So we ’re not waiting for that, because , you know, there is —there 
is thinking that the time to support the labor market is when —is when  it’s strong and not when 
we begin to see the layoffs.  There ’s some lore on that.  So that ’s the situation we ’re in.  We have, 
in fact, begun the cutting cycle now , and we ’ll be watching —and that ’ll be one of the factors that 
we consider.  Of course , we’re going to look at the totality of the data as we make these decisions 
meeting by meeting.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Michael McKee.  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 12 of 26  
 MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV and Radio.  To follow  up on 
that, what would constitute for you and the Committee a deterioration in the labor market?  
You’re pricing in, basically by the end of next year, 200 basis points of cuts just to maintain a 
higher unemployment rate.  Would you be moving to a more preemptive monetary policy style —
rather than , as you did with inflation, waiting until the data gave you a signal?  
CHAIR POWELL.  We’re going to be watching all of the data, right?   So if —as I 
mentioned in my remarks, if the labor market were to slow unexpectedly, then we have the ability to react to that by , by cutting faster.  We’re also going to be looking at our other mandate, 
though.  We are more— we have greater confidence now that inflation is moving down to 
2 percent, but , at the same time, our plan is that we will be at 2 percent, you know, over time.   
So—and policy , we think , is still restrictive , so that should still be happening. 
MICHAEL MCKEE.  I ’m just curious as to how sensitive you’ ll be to the labor market, 
since you forecast we are going to see higher unemployment and it is going to take a significant 
amount of monetary easing to just maintain it.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So, you know, what I would say is , we don’ t think we need to see 
further loosening in labor market conditions to get inflation down to 2 percent.  But we have a dual mandate, and I think you can take this whole action as —take a step back, what have we 
been trying to achieve?  We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability 
without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with disinflation.  
That’s what we ’re trying to do.  And I think you can t ake today’ s action as a sign of our strong 
commitment to achieve that goal.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Rachel.  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 13 of 26  
 RACHEL SIEGEL.  Hi , Chair Powell .  Rachel S iegel from the Washington Post.  Thanks 
for taking our questions.  You’re describing this view that you don’ t think you’ re behind when it 
comes to the job market.  Can you walk us through the specific data points that you found to be 
most helpful in the discussions at this meeting?   You’ve mentioned a couple , but would you be 
able to walk us through what that dashboard told you, as far as what you know about the job 
market now?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So we ’ll start with unemployment, which is the single most 
important one probably .  You’re at 4.2 percent.  That’s, you know —I know it ’s higher than we 
were used to seeing , numbers in the mid - and even below mid- 3s last year, but , if you look back 
over the sweep of the year s, that ’s, that’s  a low .  That’s a very healthy unemployment rate.  And 
anything in the low 4s  is, is a really —is a good labor market.  So that ’s one thing.  Participation 
is at high levels .  It’s, you know —we ’ve had —we ’re right—adjusted for demographics for 
aging, participation ’s at pretty high levels .  That’s a good thing.  Wages are still a bit above what 
would be their —wage increases, rather , are still just a bit above where they would be over the 
very longer  term to be consistent with 2 percent inflation, but they ’re very much coming down to 
what that sustainable level is.  So we feel good about that.  Vacancies over —per unemployed is 
back to what is still a very strong level .  It’s not as high as it was.  That number reached two  to 
one, two vacancies for every unemployed person.  A s measured, it ’s now below —it’s around 
one.  But that ’s still—that ’s still a very good number, I would say.  You know, quits have come 
back down to normal levels .  I mean , I could go on and on.  There are many, many employment 
indicators .  What do they say?  They say this is still a solid labor market.  The question isn’ t the 
level ; the question is that there has been change, particularly over the last few months , and, you 
know, so what we say is, as the risks, the upside risks, to inflation have really come down, the 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 14 of 26  
 downside risks to employment have increased .  And, and because we have been patient and held 
our fire on cutting while , while inflation has come down, I think we ’re now in a very good 
position to manage the risks to both of our goals. 
RACHEL SIEGEL.  And what do you expect to learn between now and November that 
will help inform the scale of the cut at the next meeting?  
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, m ore data, the usual.  Don ’t look for anything else.  We’ll 
see another labor report .  We’ll see another jobs report .  I think we get a —we might, actually —
we get two —we get a second jobs report on the day of the meeting, I think , or no, no, on the 
Friday before the meeting.   So—and inflation data .  We’ll get all this data .  We’ll be watching .  
You know, it’ s always a question of , look at the incoming data and ask what are the implications 
of that data for the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and then go through our process and 
think, what ’s the right thing to do?  Is policy where we want it to  be to foster the achievement of 
our goals over time?   So that ’s what it is , and that ’s what we ’ll be doing.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Neil.  
NEIL IRWIN.  Thanks.  Hi, Chair Powell.  Neil Irwin with Axios.  We’ve only been 
running a little above 100,000 jobs a month on payroll the last three months.  Do you view that level of job creation as worrying or alarming, or would you be —would you be  content if we 
were to kind of stick at that level?  And relatedly, you know, one of the welcome trends of the 
last couple of years has been labor markets seen coming out through job openings falling, rather than job losses.  Do you think that trend has further to run, or do you see risk that further labor 
market cooling will have to come through job losses?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So , on the job creation, it depends on—it depends on the inflows, 
right?  So , if you’ re having millions of people come into the labor force then, and you’ re creating 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 15 of 26  
 100,000 jobs, you’ re going to see unemployment go up.  So it really depends on what ’s the trend 
underlying the volatility of people coming into the country.  We understand there ’s been quite an 
influx across the borders, and that has actually been one of the things that ’s, that’s, that’s  allowed 
the unemployment rate to rise .  And the other thing is just the slower hiring rate , which is 
something we also watch carefully.  So it does depend on what ’s happening on the supply side.  
On the  Beveridge c urve question, yes, so we all felt, on the Committee, not all , but I think 
everyone on the Committee felt that job openings were so elevated that they could fall a long 
way before you hit the part of the curve where job openings turned into higher unemployment, job loss.  And yes, I mean, I think we are —it’s hard to know that —you can’ t know these things 
with great precision, but certainly it appears that we ’re very close to that point, if not at it , so that 
further declines in job openings  will translate more directly into unemployment.  But it’ s been —
it’s been a great ride down .  I mean , we’ve seen a lot of , of tightness come out of the labor 
market in that form without it resulting in lower employment.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Edward.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  Thanks , Chair Powell .  Edward Lawrence with  Fox Business.  
So we ’ve heard some speculation that you may be going with the federal funds rate to 3½, 
maybe under 4 percent .  There’s basically an entire generation that has experienced zero or near -
zero federal funds rate, and some think we ’re heading in that direction again.  What’s the 
likelihood that cheap money is now the norm?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So this is a question —and you mean after we get through all of this?  
It’s just —great question that we just, we can only speculate about.  Intuitively , most —many, 
many people anyway, would say we ’re probably not going back to that era where there were 
trillions of dollars of sovereign bonds trading at negative rates —long- term bonds trading at 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 16 of 26  
 negative rates.   And it looked like the neutral rate was—might even be negative, so —and it 
was—people were issuing debt at negative rates.   It seems that ’s so far away now .  My own sense 
is that we ’re not going back to that.  But, you know, honestly, we ’re going to find out.  But , you 
know, it feels —it feels to me that the neutral rate is probably significantly higher than it was 
back then.  How high is it?   I don’ t—I just don’ t think we know.  It’ s—again, we only know it by 
its works.  
EDWARD LAWRENCE.  And one more, how do you respond to the criticism that will 
likely come that a deeper rate cut now, before the election, has some political motivations?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Yeah, so , you know, this is my fourth presidential election at the F ed, 
and, you know, it’ s always the same.  We’re always —we’re always going into this meeting, in 
particular , and asking, what ’s the right thing to do for the people we serve?  And we do that , and 
we make a decision as a group , and then we announce it.  And it ’s—that’s always what it is.  I t’s 
never about anything else.  Nothing else is discussed , and I would also point out that the things 
that we do really affect economic conditions for the most part with a lag .  So, nonetheless, this is 
what we do.  Our job is to support the economy on behalf of the American people.  And, if we 
get it right, this will benefit the American people significantly.  So this really concentrates the 
mind , and, you know, it’ s something we all take very, very seriously.  We don’ t put up any other 
filters.  I think if you start doing that, I don’ t know where you stop.  And so we just don’ t do that.  
MICHELLE SMITH. Jo Ling. 
JO LING KENT.  Thank you, Chair Powell .  I’m Jo Ling Kent with CBS News.   My first 
question is , very simply, what message are you trying to send American consumers, the 
American people, with this unusually large rate cut?  
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 17 of 26  
 CHAIR POWELL.   I would just say that , you know, the U.S. economy is in a good place, 
and, and our decision today is designed to keep it there.  More specifically, the economy is 
growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down closer to our 2 percent objective over time, and the labor market is still in solid shape .  So our intention is really to maintain the strength that we 
currently see in the U.S. economy.  And we ’ll do that by returning rates from their high level, 
which has really been—the purpose of  which has been to get inflation under control.  We’re, 
we’re  going to move those down over time to a more normal level over time.  
JO LING KENT.  Just have a follow -up to that .  Listening to you talk about inflation 
moving meaningfully down to 2 percent, is the Federal Reserve effectively declaring a decisive victory over inflation and rising prices?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No , we’re not.  So inflation, you know —what we say is we want 
inflation —the goal is to have inflation move down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.   And, you 
know, we ’re not really —we’re close, but we ’re not really at 2 percent.  A nd I think we ’re going 
to want to see it be , you know, around 2 percent and close to 2 percent for some time, but we ’re 
certainly not doing—we ’re not saying “ mission accomplished ” or anything like that.   But I have 
to say , though, we ’re encouraged by the progress that we have made.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Catarina.  
CATARINA SARAIV A.   Hi.  Catarina Saraiva with Bloomberg News.  I just would love 
to know kind of how the Committee is thinking about the persistence we ’ve seen in housing 
inflation.   You know, do you think you can return to 2 percent with housing inflation where it is?  
Yeah.  
CHAIR POWELL.  So housing inflation is the —is the one piece that is kind of dragging 
a bit, if I can say.  We know that market rents are doing what we would want them to do, which 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 18 of 26  
 is to be moving up at relatively low levels, but they’ re not rolling over —the leases that are 
rolling over are not coming down as much and OER is coming in high.  S o, you know, it’ s been 
slower than we expected.  I think we now understand that it ’s going to take some time for those 
lower market rents to get into this.  But , you know, the direction of travel is clear, and as long as 
market rents remain , you know, relatively low inflation, over time that will show up, just the time 
it’s taking now , several years rather than just one or two cycles of annual lease renewals.  So 
that’s—I think we understand that now, but I don’ t think the outcome is in doubt again .  As long 
as market rent s remain under control, the outcome is not as in doubt.  So I would say it ’s—the 
rest of the portfolio —or of the elements that go into core PCE inflation have behaved pretty well.  
You know, t hey’re all—they all have some volatility.  We will get down to 2 percent inflation, I 
believe, and I believe that , ultimately , we’ll get what we need to get out of the housing services 
piece, too. 
CATARINA SARAIV A.   Some of your colleagues have expressed concern that , with 
starting to cut rates , you could re -ignite demand in housing and see prices go up even more.  
What ’s the likelihood of that , and how would you react to that?  
CHAIR POWELL.  The housing market, it ’s hard to—it ’s a game that —the housing 
market is in part frozen because of lock -in with low rates .  People don’ t want to sell their home s.  
So, because they have a very low mortgage, it would be quite expensive to refinance.  As rates 
come down, people will start to move more , and that ’s probably beginning to happen already.  
But remember, when that happens , you ’ve got a seller , but you’ ve also got a new buyer in many 
cases.  So it ’s not , you know, obvious  how much addi tional demand that would make.  I mean , 
the real issue with housing is that we have had, and are on track to continue to have, not enough 
housing.  And so it ’s going to be challenging.  It ’s hard to find —to zone lots that are in places 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 19 of 26  
 where people want to live .  It’s—all of the aspects of housing are more and more difficult, and , 
you know, where are we going to get the supply?  And this is not something that the Fed can , can  
really fix.  But I think , as we normalize rates, you ’ll see the housing market normalize .  And, I 
mean , ultimately by getting inflation broadly down and getting those rates normalized and 
getting the housing cycle normalized, that ’s the best thing we can do for house holders .  And then 
the supply question will have t o be dealt with by the market and also by government.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Victoria.  
VICTORIA GUIDA.  Hi.  Victoria Guida with Politico.  Just following up on some of the 
labor market talk earlier, you know, monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and 
I’m wondering how much you see being able to keep the unemployment rate from raising too 
much comes from the fact that you’ re starting to act now and that ’s going to give people more 
room to run versus just the labor market is strong.   And then, also, if I could, following up on 
Nick ’s question, do you see today ’s 50 basis point move as partially a response to the fact that 
you didn’ t cut in July and that sort of gets you to the same place?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So you’ re right about lags, but I would just point to the overall 
economy.  You have an economy that is growing at a solid pace .  If you look at forecasters or 
talk to companies, they’ ll say that they think 2025 should be a good year , too.  So there ’s no 
sense—the U.S. economy is basically fine if you talk to market participants, I mean, you know, 
business people who are actually out there doing business.  So  I think, you know, I think our 
move is timely .  I do.  And, as I said, you can —you can see our , our 50 basis point move as a 
commitment to make sure that we don ’t fall behind.  
So you’ re really asking about —your second question, you’ re asking about July.  And I 
guess if you ask if we ’d gotten the July report before the meeting, would we have cut?   We might 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 20 of 26  
 well have.  We didn’ t make that decision , but we might well have.   I think that ’s not —you know, 
that doesn’ t really answer the question that we ask ourselves, which is , let’s look, you know —at 
this meeting we’ re looking back to the July employment report, the August employment report, 
the two CPI reports, one of which came , of course , during blackout, and all of the other things 
that I mentioned .  We’re looking at all of those things , and we ’re asking oursel ves, what ’s the 
right —what ’s the policy stance we need to move to ?  We knew —it’s clear that we —clearly, 
literally, everyone on the Committee agreed that it’ s time to move.   It’s just how big—how fast 
do you go, and what do you think about the paths  forward.  So this decision we made today had 
broad support on the Committee, and I ’ve discussed the path ahead.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Elizabeth.  
ELIZABETH SCHULZE.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Elizabeth Schulze with ABC 
News.  Mortgage rates have already been dropping in anticipation of this announcement .  How 
much more should borrowers expect those rates to drop over the next year?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Very hard for me to say.  That’s—from our standpoint, I can ’t really 
speak to mortgage rates.  I will say that’ ll depend on how the economy evolves.  Our intention , 
though, is —we think that our policy was appropriately restrictive .  We think that it ’s time to 
begin the process of recalibrating it to a level that’ s more neutral, rather than restrictive.  We 
expect that process to take some time, as you can see in the projections that we released today.  
And as —if things work out according to that forecast, other rates in the economy will come 
down as well.  However, the rate at which those things happen will really depend on how the economy performs.  We can ’t see—we can ’t look a year ahead and know what the economy is to 
be doing—going to be doing. 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 21 of 26  
 ELIZABETH SCHULZE.   What ’s your message to households who are frustrated that 
home prices have still stayed so high as rates have been high?  What do you say to those 
households?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Well, what I can say to the public is that we had the highest —we had 
a burst of inflation .  Many other countries around the world had a similar burst of inflation, and, 
when that happens , part of the answer is that we raise interest rates in order to cool the economy 
off in order to reduce inflationary pressures.  It’s not something that people experience as 
pleasant, but , at the end , what you get is low inflation restored, price stability restored .  And a 
good definition of price stability i s that people in their daily decisions, they’ re not thinking about 
inflation anymore.   That’s where everyone wants to be , is back to what ’s inflation, you know?  
Just keep it low , keep it stable.  We’re restoring that.  S o what we ’re going through now really 
restores—it will benefit people over a long period of time.  Price stability benefits everybody 
over a long period of time , just by virtue of the fact that they don ’t have to deal with inflation.  
So that ’s what ’s been going on, and I think we ’ve made real progress.  I completely —we don’ t 
tell people how to think about the economy, of course .  And, of course , people are  [still] 
experiencing high prices , as opposed to high inflation.  And we understand that ’s painful.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Greg.  
GREG ROBB.   Hi, Chair Powell.  Greg Robb from Marketwatch.com.  I was wondering 
if you could go through —you said just at the beginning that , coming into the blackout , there was 
like an open thought of 25 or 50—you know, the F ed could move either 25 or 50.  I would sort of 
argue that when we had those two last speeches by Governor Waller and New York F ed President 
John Williams, that they were sort of saying that maybe a gradual approach was going to win the day.  I mean , I sort of want to ask a seven -part question about this.  But, I mean, could you talk—
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 22 of 26  
 would you have cut rates by 50 basis points if the market had been pricing in, like , low odds of a 
50 point move like they were last Wednesday , you know, a fter the CPI number came out?   It was 
a really small probability of a 50 point cut.  D oes that play in your consideration at all?   Just talk 
a little bit about that.  Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL.   We’re always going to try to do what we think is the right thing for 
the economy at that time.  That’s what we’ ll do.  And that ’s what we did today.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Simon. 
SIMON RABINOVITCH.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Simon Rabinovitch with the 
Economist.  You’ve mentioned how closely you’ re watching the labor market, but you also noted 
that payroll numbers have been a little bit less reliable lately because of the big downward revisions.  Does that put your focus overwhelmingly on the unemployment rate?  And given the 
SEP projection of 4.4 [percent] basically being the peak in the cycle, would going above that be 
the kind of thing that would trigger another 50 basis point cut?  
CHAIR POWELL.  So we will continue to look at that broad array of labor market data, 
including the payroll numbers.  We’re not discarding those.  I mean , we’ll certainly look at those, 
but we will mentally tend to adjust them based on the QCEW adjustment, which you referred to.  There isn ’t a bright line .  You know, it will be —the unemployment rate ’s very important, of 
course, but there isn’ t a single statistic or single bright line over which that thing that might move 
that would dictate one thing or another.  We’ll look at—each meeting , we’ll look at all the data 
on inflation, economic activity, and the labor market , and we ’ll make decisions about , is our 
policy stance where it needs to be to foster over the medium term our mandate goals ?  So I 
can’t—I can’t  say we have a bright line in mind.

 MATT EGAN.  Thanks , Chair Powell.  Matt Egan from CNN.  I know that you discussed 
earlier  how the F ed does whatever the right thing is and nothing else factors in.  But , in general, 
can you talk about whether or not you believe a sitting U.S. president should have a say in F ed 
decisions on interest rates?  Because that ’s something that former P resident Trump, who 
obviously appointed you, has previously suggested.  And I know the F ed is designed to be 
independent , but why?  Can you tell the public why you view that as so important?  
CHAIR POWELL.  Sure .  So countries that are —democracies around the world, 
countries that are sort of like the United States, all have what are called independent central 
banks.  And the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from 
direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people who are in office as opposed to people who are not in office.  So that ’s the idea, is that —
you know, I think the data are clear that countrie s that have independent central banks, they get 
lower inflation .  And so we ’re, we ’re not —we do our work to serve all Americans .  We’re not 
serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing.  It’s just maximum 
employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans.  And that ’s how the other central 
banks are set up, too.  It ’s a good institutional arrangement, which has been good for the public 
and I hope —and I hope and strongly believe that it will continue.  
MICHELLE SMITH.  Kyle.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.   Kyle Campbell for American Banker.   Thanks for taking the 
questions, Chair Powell.  A couple regulatory developments in the past week that I want to ask 
you about.  First, last week Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined his views for the 
changes to the Base l III endgame.   I’m wondering if you are in alignment with him on what 
those changes should be, if those have support on the B oard in the broad way that you’ re looking 
September 18, 2024 Chair Powell ’s Press Conference  FINAL  
Page 24 of 26  
 for, and if you think the other agencies are also fully onboard with that approach.  And then 
yesterday, other banking regulators — 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know what, hold the second question.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Okay .  Sure. 
CHAIR POWELL.  We’ll give you the second question.  So the answer to your question 
is that, yes, those , those  changes were negotiated between the agencies with my support and with 
my involvement, with the idea that we were going to re -propose, re -propose the changes that 
Vice Chair Barr talked about and then take comment on them.  So, yes, that is —that ’s happening 
with my support.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Is there a date for that — 
CHAIR POWELL.  That’s not a final proposal , though, you understand.  W e’re putting 
them out for comment.  W e’re going to take comment and make appropriate changes.  We don’ t 
have a —we don’t have a calendar date for that , and , as for the other agencies, you know, the idea 
is that we ’re all moving together , we’re not moving separately, so that —I don ’t know exactly 
where that is.  But the idea is that we will move as a group to put this , again , out for comment, 
and then, you know, it’ ll—the comments will come back 60 days later , and we ’ll dive into them, 
and we ’ll try to bring this to a conclusion sometime in the first half of next year.  
KYLE CAMPBELL.  Right.  And then, yesterday . there were merger reform finalizations 
from the other bank regulators .  What does the F ed have to do to align itself on a merger ? 
CHAIR POWELL.  You know, I would—I would bounce that question to Vice Chair 
Barr.  It ’s a good question, but I don ’t have that today.  Thanks. 
MICHELLE SMITH.  Jennifer , for the last question.

 JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Thank you, Chair Powell.  Jennifer Schonberger with 
Yahoo Finance.  You said earlier that the decision today reflects with appropriate recalibration 
strength in the labor market that could be maintained in the context of moderate growth, even 
though the policy statement says you view the risks to inflation and job growth as roughly 
balanced.   Given what you’ ve said , though, today, I ’m curious, are you more worried about the 
job market and growth than inflation?  Are they not roughly balanced?  
CHAIR POWELL.  No, I think— I think, and we think, they are now roughly balanced.  
So if you go back for a long time, the risks were on inflation.  W e had  a historically tight labor 
market, historically tight.  There was a severe labor shortage , so very hot labor market .  And we 
had inflation way above target.  So, you know, that said to us, concentrate on inflation, concentrate on inflation.  And we did for a while , and we kept at that, that the stance that we put 
in place 14 months ago was a stance that wa s focused on bringing down inflation.  Part of 
bringing down inflation,  though, is cooling off the economy and a little bit cooling off the labor 
market.  You now have a cooler labor market, in part because of our activity.  So what that tells 
you is , it’s time to change our stance.   So we did that.  The sense of the change in the stance is 
that we ’re recalibrating our policy over time to a stance that will be more neutral.  And today 
was—I think we made a good strong start on that.  I think it was the right decision, and I  think it 
should send a signal that we , you know, that  we’re committed to coming up with a good outcome 
here.  
JENNIFER SCHONBERGER.  Is the economy more vulnerable to a shock now that 
could tip it into recession?  
CHAIR POWELL.  I don’ t think so.  I don’ t—there ’s—as I look—well, let me look at it 
this way :  I don’t see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood of a

Page 26 of 26  
 recession —sorry, of a downturn is elevated, okay?  I don’ t see that.  You see—you see growth at 
a solid rate, you see inflation coming down, and you see a labor market that ’s, that’s  still at very 
solid levels.  So, so I don’ t really see that, no.  Thank you. 
MICHELLE SMITH .  Thank you.
